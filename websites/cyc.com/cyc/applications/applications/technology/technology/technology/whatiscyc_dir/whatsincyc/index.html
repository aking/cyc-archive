<font color="#458B74" size="+2"><b>the Cyc Knowledge Base<SMALL><SUP>TM</SUP></SMALL></b></font><br><br>

The Cyc knowledge base (KB) is a formalized representation of a vast quantity of fundamental 
human knowledge: facts, rules of thumb, and heuristics for reasoning about the objects and 
events of everyday life.  The medium of representation is the formal language 
<a href="howdoescycreason#Cycl">CycL</a>, described below.  The KB consists of terms--which constitute the
 vocabulary of CycL--and assertions which relate those terms.  These assertions include 
both simple ground assertions and rules.  Cyc is not a frame-based system: the Cyc team 
thinks of the KB instead as a sea of assertions, with each assertion being no more "about" 
one of the terms involved than another.<p>

The Cyc KB is divided into many (currently thousands of) "microtheories", each of which is 
essentially a bundle of assertions that share a common set of assumptions; some
microtheories are  focused on a particular domain of knowledge, a particular level of
detail, a particular interval in time, etc.  The microtheory mechanism allows Cyc to 
independently maintain assertions which are <i>prima facie</i> contradictory, and enhances
 the performance of the Cyc system by focusing the inferencing process.<p>

At the present time, the Cyc KB contains nearly two hundred thousand terms and several dozen
hand-entered
assertions about/involving each term.  New assertions are continually added to the KB
by human knowledge enterers.  Additionally, term-denoting functions allow for the automatic 
creation of millions of non-atomic terms, such as 
<font size="3"><tt>(LiquidFn Nitrogen)</tt></font>; and Cyc adds a vast 
number of assertions to the KB by itself as a product of the inferencing process.<p>

<font color="#458B74" size="+2"><b><a name="nl">natural-language processing</a></b></font><br><br>

Natural-language (NL) processing is among the most studied -- and most intractable -- outstanding 
challenges of software engineering.  Many teams have attempted to produce NL systems capable 
of reading and making sense of plain english text, but none have succeeded to any significant 
degree outside of narrow, pre-conceived domains.  As shown in the examples below, Cyc-like common
 sense is a prerequisite for human-level competence at this task.<p>

Consider the following pair of sentences:<p>

<ul>
	<li>Fred saw the plane flying over Zurich.
	<li>Fred saw the mountains flying over Zurich.
</ul>

Although the sentences are very similar, humans have little difficulty in recognizing that in 
the first sentence, "flying" probably refers to the plane, while in the second sentence, 
"flying" almost certainly refers to Fred.  Traditional NL systems will have difficulty 
resolving this syntactic ambiguity, but because Cyc knows that planes fly and mountains do 
not, it will be able to reject nonsensical interpretations.  It's difficult to see 
how this could be done without relying on a large database of common sense.<p>

Here are a couple more examples; these involve pronoun disambiguation:

<ul>
	<li>The police arrested the demonstrators because <em>they</em> feared violence.
	<li>The police arrested the demonstrators because <em>they</em> advocated violence.
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Mary saw the dog in the store window and wanted <em>it</em>.
	<li>Mary saw the dog in the store window and pressed her nose up against <em>it</em>.
</ul>

The Cyc-NL system has three components: the lexicon, the syntactic parser, and the semantic 
interpreter.  These are described in greater detail on the 
<a href="cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/nlu">natural language understanding page</a>.  
At the moment, we are focusing our efforts on broadening the coverage of all three components 
of Cyc-NL. We are currently able to correctly parse many different sentence types, including
 ambiguous and syntactically complex inputs. Cyc is capable of handling negation, modals, and
 nested quantifiers.  We are developing interfaces which will allow people to make assertions
 and query Cyc using english instead of <a href="howdoescycreason#Cycl">CycL</a>. We also are working
 on a generation component, which will produce english strings from 
<a href="howdoescycreason#Cycl">CycL</a> formulas.<p>

Cyc's NL capabilities form the foundation for applications in 
<a href="cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/is">knowledge-enhanced searching of captioned information</a>, and for 
user-friendly interfaces to other applications, including the 
<a href="cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/sksi">database integration</a> application.<p>

Future directions for Cyc-NL will include:<p>

<ul>
<li>exploring the role Cyc could play in machine translation
<li>using Cyc-NL to post-process output of speech recognition systems
<li>harnessing Cyc-NL to enhance user interfaces.
</ul><p>

Other potential applications are myriad.

<font color="#458B74" size="+2"><b><a name="sib">Semantic Integration Bus<SMALL><SUP>TM</SUP></SMALL></a></b></font><br><br>

Computer-based information is stored in many forms, including data that is structured (databases),
 semi-structured (spreadsheets, web pages), and unstructured (text files and text fields).
 Cyc can turn some of this information into usable knowledge, and the remainder can be annotated for
 easier access by humans.
<p>
Cyc treats each database record as if it were an implicit
 assertion in the knowledge base.  These implicit assertions are then available
 during inference.  Similarly, text fields can be read using the natural language processor to see if
 they contain any useful implicit assertions.  Sometimes the assertions describe what the text is
 "about".  Cyc can use this information to locate and report information resources which the user
 may employ to answer a particular query.
<p>

<p>
In the above diagram, information stored in a database or on the web is made available to the 
inference engine as virtual assertions.  These sets of virtual assertions are managed by heuristic 
level (HL) modules.  For example, the inference engine "broadcasts" a query on the bus.  An HL 
module recognizes that the request asks for an assertion which maps into its virtual knowledge 
space.  The HL module intercepts the request, communicates with the database, web site or other 
knowledge source, and returns bindings to the inference engine.  Inference then continues, 
combining information from multiple sources.

<font color="#458B74" size="+2"><b><a name="interface">developer toolsets</a></b></font><br><br>

The Cyc system also includes a variety of interface tools that permit the user to browse, edit, 
and extend the Cyc KB, to pose queries to the inference engine, and to interact with the 
<a href="#nl">natural-language</a> and <a href="cycrandd/areasofrandd_dir/sksi">database 
integration</a> modules.<p>

The most commonly-used tool, our HTML browser, allows the user to view the KB in a hypertexty way.  
HTML pages describing Cyc terms are generated on the fly by the Cyc system.  Each page describes a 
Cyc term by showing all the assertions in which it is involved, organized according to a standard 
schema.  Every occurrence of a Cyc term is an HTML link to a (dynamically-generated) HTML page 
describing that term, so that it is easy to surf around the KB following a network of 
relationships.  The HTML browser also includes facilities for searching and editing the KB and 
for posing queries to the inference engine.<p>

Other HTML interface tools include:

<ul>
<li>A hierarchy browser, which displays any desired subtree of the Cyc subset tree in outline format.
<li>A lexicon editor, which provides a user-friendly way to edit and extend the Cyc lexicon.
<li>An English-to-CycL parser, which lets users experiment with Cyc's natural language facilities by parsing arbitrary English strings.
<li>A database tool interface, which provides an interface to Cyc's <a href="#sib">semantic integration</a> module.
<li>A WordNet browser, which allows users to view WordNet in relation to the Cyc ontology.
<li>An English generator, which restates Cyc rules in English.
</ul>
