      <p>In the past year over 40,000 copies of OpenCyc have been downloaded
from <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/opencyc" target="external">SourceForge</a>. How
should these separate Cyc-enabled computers collaborate to create a whole
which is much smarter than the sum of its parts?  And while one Cyc server
can easily support a dozen clients at the same time, handling operations
from thousands of clients would overwhelm a computer-bound Cyc server.  
How do we address this scalability issue?</p>             
      <p>Current state-of-the-art suggests that a <a
 href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cache/papers/cs/26821/http:zSzzSzwww.kbs.uni-hannover.dezSzArbeitenzSzPublikationenzSz2002zSzdraft_superhub.pdf/nejdl02superpeerbased.pdf" target="external">Super-Peer network</a>
is the solution. &nbsp;Cyc's context mechanism provides a natural partitioning
of knowledge suitable for distributed implementation.</p>
      <p>In fact, this is how humans work: we <i>specialize</i> and <i>collaborate</i>.
 Although most humans share a core of common  knowledge which allows them
to communicate, no one human possesses all the knowledge of the  human race.
 Instead, we have experts in law, medicine, construction, automotive repair,
and  software design.  When a human lacks the knowledge to solve a problem,
he can often find a  solution by collaborating with an expert.  When you go
to the doctor with a persistent headache,  the doctor's knowledge of medicine
combines with your knowledge of your symptoms to produce a  solution that
neither could have reached alone.</p>
      <p>In a distributed Cyc architecture, the network is populated with
Cyc agents, each of which  shares a common core of knowledge as well as a 
unique extension of expert knowledge in a particular domain.  Most importantly, 
the various  Cyc agents
are endowed with the ability to communicate with each other and to perform
inferencing  in a collaborative fashion.  The inter-agent communication can
be handled flexibly by using CycML, <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/" target="external">OWL</a>, or some other knowledge-sharing
 protocol, or it can be implemented using a more efficient Cyc-specific protocol.</p>
      <p>Cyc agents in a distributed architecture share knowledge describing
how they can be reached  (via which network address, port, and protocol)
and what their areas of expertise are.  During  inferencing, when an agent
tries to expand a formula whose content lies outside its area of  expertise,
it determines (by consulting its own knowledge base or consulting with a
central  knowledge-broker agent) whether another agent is available that
might be able to help.  If so,  the agent sends a message to its remote counterpart
asking it to help expand the formula in  question.  The answer may be a complete
set of bindings, but more commonly it is simply a  partial result, still
containing unbound variables.  The local agent incorporates the result  into
its own proof tree just as if it had done the work itself, and continues
its task.  In  many cases, the local agent may need to consult the remote
agent, or several remote agents,  multiple times in the course of its inferencing
process.</p>     
      <p>Cycorp has cooperated with the Computer Science Department of the
University of Maryland in  Baltimore County (<a
 href="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/" target="external">UMBC</a>) to develop a demo of such a  distributed
architecture.  In the demo, three Cyc agents communicate with each other
using KQML.   While all three agents possess the same core knowledge base,
each possesses additional knowledge  about an additional domain in which
it is considered to be an expert: the GeoAgent in geography,  the PolAgent
in politics, and the EcoAgent in economics.  Working together, they can answer
queries  that no one of them could have answered alone.</p>
      <p>For example, suppose a user asks the GeoAgent for "elected heads
of government of countries  north of the equator".  This might be represented
as:</p>
      <p>
<font face="Courier">(#$and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(#$headOfGovernmentOf ?x ?y)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(#$hasAttributes ?x #$Elected)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(#$northOf ?y #$Equator))</font></p>
                   
      <p>The GeoAgent is able to find bindings for the third clause by using
its own knowledge of the geography domain: </p>
             
      <ul>
        <li>Britain is in Europe.</li>
        <li>Europe is in the northern hemisphere.</li>
        <li>The northern hemisphere is north of the equator.</li>
        <li>If region A is part of region B, and region B is north of region
C, then region A is north of region C.</li>
        <li>Therefore, Britain is north of the equator.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But to find bindings for the first two clauses, the GeoAgent must enlist outside
help.  It sends these as queries to the PolAgent, which is able to find bindings
for them using its knowledge of politics domain:             
      <ul>
        <li>Heads of government of democratic countries are elected.</li>
        <li>Great Britain is a democratic country.</li>
        <li>Tony Blair is the head of government of Britain.</li>
        <li>Therefore, Tony Blair is the elected head of government of Great
Britain.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>When the GeoAgent agent receives this answer back from the PolAgent, it combines
it with its own partial answer to produce the final result: TonyBlair.</p>
                    
      <p><i>For more details on the Cycorp/UMBC demo of the distributed Cyc
architecture, see <a
 href="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/%7Efinin/papers/cfn95.pdf" target="external">"The Cycic Friends
Network: getting Cyc agents to reason together"</a>, a paper describing the
project which was presented at the 1995 CIKM conference.  Also see <a
 href="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml/" target="external">The UMBC KQML Web</a>,
a page at UMBC describing the concept in greater detail.</i></p>
             
      <p>It should also be pointed out that, while the description above
assumes that all the agents participating in the distributed architecture
are Cyc agents, this is not a requirement.  Cycorp has defined a very simple
protocol for implementing cooperative inferencing, and any agent which has
been taught to adhere to this protocol, and which possesses knowledge of
interest to other agents, can meaningfully participate in such an architecture.
 For instance, the role normally played by a Cyc agent in a distributed architecture
could equally well be filled by a gateway to
             
      <ul>
        <li>an expert system implemented in Prolog</li>
        <li>an SQL database</li>
        <li>a special-purpose inferencing tool (e.g. for spatial inferencing)
          </li>
        <li>a human expert</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
             
      </ul></p>

<p>
In fact, the WWW Information Retrieval application builds on the distributed
Cyc architecture by filling that role with a gateway to a WWW information
source.</p>
