        <h2>Applying for a ResearchCyc License</h2>
        ResearchCyc is a version of the <a href="http://www.cyc.com/cyc/technology/whatiscyc">Cyc</a>
        technology designed specifically for use by researchers. Cyc is the world's largest and
        most complete general knowledge base and commonsense reasoning engine.</p>
        <p>
        The natural language facilities of ResearchCyc include a rich lexicon, multiple parsers,
        and an English-language generation capability. (Note that Version 1.0 of OpenCyc 
        contain English strings corresponding to Cyc terms, but no additional NL capabilities.) ResearchCyc also includes
        additional functionality, such as Semantic Knowledge Source Integration (SKSI), 
        a Java-based Fact Entry Tool, a Query Formulator, and an ontology exporter.
        <ol>
        <li>
        Print the <a href="ResearchCyc_License_Rev2.1.pdf">license</a>, fill it out, and have it signed by an authorized
        representative of your organization. For applications from academia, the representative should be a department head
        or higher, rather than the individual researcher. Further, if the license signed at
        the level of an academic department, use should be restricted to users
        authorized by that department.
        </li><p>
        <li>
        Fax the signed license to Cycorp at +1 512-342-4030. Make sure the organization
        name is legible. Whether or not you include a cover page, it would be useful
        for you to write an email address somewhere on the material you send.
        </li><p>
        <li>
        Send an email to rcyc@cyc.com. Mention that you have faxed a license, and 
        include a brief (approximately 2 paragraphs) description of your area of
        research and how you might use ResearchCyc in your work. If any of your 
        project description (or the fact that you are using ResearchCyc) should be 
        kept confidential, please indicate this. Otherwise, we will assume we can 
        include this information on our website. Also, as a service to fellow researchers,
        we would like to include contact information for someone from your organization on
        a password protected page that only other ResearchCyc users may access. Let us know
        if you don't want to be included on this list.
        </li><p>
        <li>
        Most requests will be processed within 1 week from the time the email and
        fax are received. If we approve the license, we will create an ftp account
        for you that you can use to download ResearchCyc.
        </li><p>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>License Comparison</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
        <p>
        <li>
        ResearchCyc is available under a no cost <a href="ResearchCyc_License_Rev2.1.pdf">license</a> that, among other things, 
        requires the licensee to restrict access of the knowledge base content and 
        the ResearchCyc knowledge server to authorized users only.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li>
        While ResearchCyc is licensed to qualifying organizations and individuals, it is 
        generally easier for an organization to qualify than an individual. Please attempt
        to apply as part of an organization before resorting to submitting a
        license signed by an individual.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li>
        Cycorp encourages publication of results of working with ResearchCyc. If you feel 
        limited by the disclosure terms (esp. 4.2), contact us for a waiver. We would 
        especially like to encourage graduate thesis work involving ResearchCyc.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li>
        The OpenCyc knowledge base (KB) content is licensed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License, 
        Version 2</a>. The OpenCyc inference engine is a free binary (no source code is provided) 
         that provides a way for users to access and manipulate the open source KB.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li>
        Cycorp intends to release to OpenCyc all of the Cyc (non-propietary) concept terms, 
        to ensure that the ontologies developed in Cyc will be compatible with those developed using OpenCyc.
        </li>
