<H3><A NAME="WhatIsIt">What is FACTory?</A></H3>

<ul><li><font color=#cc0000><b>FACTory</b></font> is a game that
lets people enter knowledge into the Cyc Knowledge Base, a large store of
common-sense knowledge, and hopefully have fun doing it.  This means
that every time you answer a question, you're helping push the frontier
of artificial intelligence.  (You may also
want to know <a href="HelpingAI.html">How You're Helping AI</a>).<p>

Cyc is trying to determine the truth or falsehood of a series of
facts.  It will ask about things someone has told it, things it read
about on the web, and things that it's just guessing about. You will
be presented with these facts and asked whether you think they're true
or false.<p>

As people play the game,
Cyc accumulates votes; when enough people
have agreed that a fact is true or not, Cyc considers it
<i>confirmed</i> and stops asking about it.<p>
</ul>

<ul><li>Playing the game is simple. Cyc presents a screen with a statement that
it's trying to find out about; you are asked to click buttons saying whether
that statement is true, false, don't know, or "doesn't make sense" (since
Cyc sometimes asks some pretty strange things).<p>

<li>They're not all right...<p>

<li>Sometimes, Cyc will ask multiple questions on the same screen, usually
ones that are connected in some way.<p>

<li>After you've played through ten screens of questions, you'll have finished
a round. Cyc will then give you a score for that round, as well as
your current total score.</ul>

<H3><A NAME="Scoring">Scoring and High Scores</A></H3>

<ul><li>You always get points for playing <font color=#cc0000><b>FACTory</b></font>,
because Cyc is always grateful for every bit of knowledge.  You get two points for
every question you answer, so you always get a minimum of twenty points in a round.
There are two ways to do better then that:<p>

<ul><li>Sometimes you'll get a screen with more than one question on it, which means
you'll get four or six points, depending on how many questions it offers.  This
happens randomly&mdash;just watch for it to show up.<p>

<li>When Cyc has gotten enough votes on the answer to a question&mdash;say, eight
other people have agreed that whooping cough causes coughing, and you're the tenth&mdash;it
becomes convinced of that answer. That's worth a ten-point bonus, because Cyc is now confident
of its knowledge.<p>

</ul><p>

<li>It doesn't matter whether the fact it's asking about is true or false, as
long as you agree with other players about it.  That means answering each
question truthfully will give you the best score over time, not to
mention helping Cyc most!<p>

If you tell Cyc something that disagrees with what
others have said, it gets confused.<p>

Of course, it's always all right to say you don't know whether a fact is true
or not.<p>

<li>Cyc will always keep a list of the top ten scorers of all time, very like
a traditional arcade game. <a href="http://www.cyc.com">Cycorp</a> is considering
ways of awarding prizes the top ten scorers each month; check back for
more information, or make a suggestion!

<H2>Have fun playing!</H2>
