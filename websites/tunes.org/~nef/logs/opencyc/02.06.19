06:14:28 <Yepster> will 0.7 support mt import/export in daml?
06:28:46 <stevereed_home> We have DAML export via the java api running now.  I expect to get the DAML import code working by rel 0.7.
06:30:43 <Yepster> :) getting a bit tired of copying all assertions to an import script.

07:15:24 <stevereed_home> You will need CycML import/export for handling the full range of CycL grammar, and that will be included in rel. 0.7
07:16:11 <Yepster> hmm uhh I meant cycml actually.

12:21:51 * dmiles fires back up the work he was doing and cant remmber all the questions he had but knows there are a couple API questions
12:22:58 <dmiles> oh an intial *-TheWord sentence breaker
12:23:42 <dmiles> i was guessing that some smaller parts of cyc NL understanding work.. maybe not all in concert but enough to leverage smaller parts
12:24:37 <dmiles> any idea if there are any functions from cyc NLU that have made it into cycL or Subl function?
12:26:46 <dmiles> i noticed things like  (BestNLPhraseOfStringFn "a biological parent of")  are dentational in structure (non evaluatable)
12:27:55 <dmiles> i am looking to find what generation based predicates can be reused in some effort towards understanding as well
12:29:08 <dmiles> hrrm nothing resultIsa EnglishWord
12:30:52 <dmiles> what i am asking is help finding infernce modules that use things like (compoundString Eat-TheWord 
12:30:53 <dmiles>        ("a" "meal") Verb HavingAMeal)
12:32:31 <dmiles> so i dont have to do as much work in prolog.. i know how relations like that works and how to use them.. but i figure there must be some subl call that will unify "eat a meal" with #$HavingAMeal

15:35:38 <dmiles> Ballot Question:   "Should the IEEE SUO WG commence work on OpenCyc, CycML, and CycL, with the intent of developing them into one or more candidate standards."
15:36:11 <jlatour> What would a standard about OpenCyc define?
15:36:35 <dmiles> hrrm .. i haven't seen any mail about what this could mean to the basic KE in cyc already if the group will want to make changes
15:36:58 <jlatour> I can understand CycML and CycL, but OpenCyc is just the software, isn't it?
15:37:00 <dmiles> it allows us to write Cyc aware applications easier 
15:37:26 <dmiles> so we can see we wrote it to the IEEE spec.. and therefore Cyc will run our software
15:37:45 <jlatour> What are you talking about?
15:38:12 <dmiles> yes your correct opencyc is software :)
15:38:30 <dmiles> i am not sure what "OpenCyc" means in that question
15:38:48 <dmiles> perhaps the .6 ontology
15:39:00 <dmiles> if so will the .7 ontogy be ok?
15:39:42 <dmiles> right now the question is between SUMO's Entity vs. OpenCyc's Thing
15:40:09 <jlatour> And what would you standardize? Make standard names for everything?
15:40:26 <dmiles> i am talking about that the IEEE standards commitee needs to spec out an ontology to be used internationally
15:40:44 <dmiles> so they are considering OpenCyc
15:40:57 <jlatour> And how do you define 'ontology' in this case?
15:41:01 <dmiles> standardizing Names basicly.. 
15:41:24 <dmiles> and possibly getting everyone to agree what the names mean
15:41:46 <jlatour> So you want to take things like #$#LivingThing or whatever it's called, and standardise those names?
15:41:53 <dmiles> ontology would be the 'genls' hierachy and genlPreds
15:42:10 <dmiles> and argIsas
15:42:23 <jlatour> OK, but where does it end?
15:43:01 <dmiles> #$#LivingThing <- yes to that question 
15:43:13 <dmiles> hehe. yeah .. where does it end?
15:43:34 <dmiles> since these hairachies need rules to explain how they work
15:43:36 <jlatour> Because I think how you defined it, they'd have to take everything in the world
15:44:34 <dmiles> yes.. well be able to draw the top 15 levels maybe of the entire world
15:44:41 <jlatour> I don't think you should standardise the ontology through W3C/IEEE, but CycL and CycML might be good candidates
15:45:30 <dmiles> yes some on the voting commitee agree that there should not be any names.. just structure
15:45:57 <jlatour> The voting committee?
15:46:07 <dmiles> like we should all decide there is a concept of heirarchy and context
15:46:19 <dmiles> i am not a voting member
15:46:27 <dmiles> i just am a subscriber
15:46:36 <dmiles> http://suo.ieee.org
15:46:37 <jlatour> Which committee?
15:46:39 <jlatour> Ah

15:46:53 --- join: johnd (johnd@207.207.8.65) joined #opencyc
15:47:11 <jlatour> Hrm, that could be done
15:47:17 <dmiles> opencyc moves forward SUO in my opiniopn
15:47:31 <jlatour> Seems like it, at first glance
15:47:52 <dmiles> well part of the commitee process could entail combing through everty rule and assertion in Cyc
15:48:32 <dmiles> that would be fun.. especially when you watch teh commitee go though files and rule of less then 1% of opencyc
15:48:56 <jlatour> Slowly?
15:49:07 <dmiles> and how the meaning of one axiom can strectch for weeks
15:49:16 <dmiles> yes its very slow and labourous
15:49:55 <jlatour> The first 10 concepts are planned to be released in 2026?
15:50:15 <dmiles> some people who vote think that whatever they decide one.. there is no reason opencyc _cant_ be included
15:50:35 <dmiles> its at least a concrete working model
15:51:04 <dmiles> yeahh heh.. but i think they only ahve until 20003
15:51:10 <dmiles> err 2003
15:51:38 <jlatour> 20003 is plenty of time :)
15:51:59 <dmiles> one cyc axiom or gaf * 1 week.. not sure 
15:57:47 <dmiles> :)
15:58:24 <dmiles> interesting though.. i really hope they adopt opencyc.. otherwise seems there would be a continued floundering
15:58:50 <jlatour> That proposal looks interesting
15:59:03 <jlatour> http://ontology.teknowledge.com/
16:00:13 <dmiles> definately.. i think someone could do a SUMO<->Cyc map
16:01:01 <dmiles> i mean really do it.. see what each could gain from each other
16:01:10 --- quit: johnd ("Client Exiting")
16:01:42 * jlatour nods. "Sounds good, but also a lot of work"
16:03:14 <dmiles> i tried to do a bit .. just genlsPreding things.. there where a cpouple name clashes
16:03:42 <jlatour> Just name clashes?
16:03:43 <dmiles> both have a Class .. but in sumo it means Collection 
16:04:02 <jlatour> Ouch, that's a bad clash :)
16:04:27 <dmiles> so if each constance was suffixed with _Sumo.. it makes things workable
16:05:08 <jlatour> Namespaces.
16:07:41 <dmiles> yeah.. when i loaded SUMO into cyc i found that it was able to gain things mainly from the bottem 25% of the file
16:08:09 <dmiles> the upper half is structural into the descritions of CODE based rules in opencyc
16:10:42 <dmiles> (not intentionally)
16:10:50 <dmiles> but basic to logic
16:12:16 <jlatour> Well I think it would indeed be useful to compare them. But now, now I'm going to bed.
16:12:30 <dmiles> take care.. goodnight
16:12:35 <jlatour> Goodnight
16:12:44 <CycLBot> Take what?

23:02:32 <dmiles> hi Edison
23:03:18 <Edison> hi dmiles
23:04:00 <Edison> Have you already started your new job ?
23:04:08 <dmiles> start monday
23:04:32 <dmiles> they are sending me my projects (2 of them)
23:04:37 <Edison> oh! I hope we meet sometimes in irc, anyway :-)
23:05:08 <dmiles> and then i propose hours and people needed.. then they authorize the bid
23:05:34 <Edison> woha... be careful
23:06:02 <dmiles> well not quite the number of people.. ussualy just me ;P
23:06:24 <dmiles> but they have a couple other developers that can help me so i have to describe when they are needed
23:06:24 <Edison> :-P
23:06:50 <Edison> How do you coordinate work? Is there any web repository like Sourceforge?
23:06:57 <dmiles> its intereting one project is an email router and the other a sentence breaker
23:07:22 <dmiles> well they use VSS ;P
23:08:00 <dmiles> which is fine its only a CVS.. not better or worse
23:08:30 * Edison doesnt like VSS much
23:08:55 <Edison> it has no branches or at least tags
23:09:00 <Edison> imho
23:09:28 <dmiles> we plan on using opencyc to keep our statistics for keyword frequency in order to comne up with probibilties of final destination of  email
23:10:11 <dmiles> and then later get elabourate to ussing cyc to help us with content descisions 
23:10:41 <dmiles> well yeah.. there are things to make VSS more useful
23:10:49 <Edison> reasonable
23:11:14 <dmiles> i guess there is a large demand for "email routing" out there
23:11:36 <Edison> errm. not sure about that.
23:11:51 <Edison> how do you call it? semantic routing?
23:11:59 <dmiles> meaning companies have one mail box for issues .. and they want the right person to get the email
23:12:26 <dmiles> so you find certain sentences like.. 
23:12:50 <dmiles> i cant ?X 
23:13:08 <dmiles> or you guys realy ?Profanity
23:13:39 <dmiles> all types of measurements 
23:13:55 <dmiles> no system works all the time
23:14:19 <dmiles> but yes getting the semantic content is probly the most reliable way
23:16:39 <dmiles> the hardest part about a project like this is giving a reasonable timeline (as in hours) building a java system talking with Cyc to do this should take
23:17:40 <dmiles> i would think 1 week start before being able to really quote
23:19:54 <dmiles> i am guessing right now a full month would not be out of line to have a system that checks a pop3 account and smtps the mail to the correct person

23:21:18 <dmiles> well it shouldnt interfere too much
23:22:07 <dmiles> i am hoping that where i go with nl understanding and cyc .. it will be usefuill
23:22:35 <dmiles> the other thing.. that that company wants is a parse tree maker
23:22:51 <dmiles> nothing beyond that at this point
23:23:31 <dmiles> just simple.. Subject Object Verb grabber so people can write response templates i am assuming
23:25:01 <dmiles> so eliza like rules can be formed arround the results initially
23:27:37 * _Edison_ is no pro on this
23:27:39 <dmiles> i am hoping that even that rule side could be maintained in cyc.. would make good sense
23:28:30 <dmiles> espancly if response was genTemplates
23:30:29 <dmiles> well it's one of those more simlpe ideas you can read about in AI books but rearly see implemetnations that try to use the idea beyond non toy exampoles
23:31:58 <dmiles> sometimes the simplicity in solutions (response templates) can make things go much further
