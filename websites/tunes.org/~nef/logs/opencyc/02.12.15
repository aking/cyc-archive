12:14:26 <mdupont-away> check out our newest patch for the gcc at introspector.sf.net cvs, and on #introspector@openprojects.
12:23:51 <mdupont-away> quick intro This Meta-Data includes all data collected about your software by the Compiler, the Make system, the Project and Packaging system, the CVS Logs and the Mailling List.
12:23:51 <mdupont-away> <mdupont> The Introspector's scope was originally just the GCC "C" compiler, but will be expanded to include the extraction of  meta-data from different compilers and interpreters.
12:23:51 <mdupont-away> <mdupont> including ecma standard c# reflection
12:24:12 <mdupont-away> check out our port of mingw32 cross compiling at http://introspector.sourceforge.net/dia_win32.htm

12:31:36 <yottzumm> anybody have a link to building a religious or spiritual belief system?
12:31:47 <yottzumm> or philosophical belief system
12:31:57 <mdupont-away> cool
12:32:14 <mdupont-away> we talked about building a numerogy hashing system today
12:32:39 <yottzumm> I don't even know what numerogy is
12:33:02 <mdupont-away> cabbalah
12:33:07 <yottzumm> oh
12:33:22 <mdupont-away> letters of the angels names make hash function
12:33:31 <mdupont-away> hash collision has mystic meaning
12:33:33 <yottzumm> what was the conclusion?
12:33:40 <yottzumm> oh
12:33:51 <mdupont-away> if two numbers coniside, the hash function that is
12:33:57 <mdupont-away> then you have a connection
12:34:11 <mdupont-away> if you do a dictionary, or hash paragraphs of the bible
12:34:21 <mdupont-away> then you will find links
12:34:32 <yottzumm> so how many hashing systems are there?
12:34:38 <mdupont-away> these were the roots of numberolgy
12:34:43 <mdupont-away> <sp=>
12:34:51 <yottzumm> numerology
12:35:00 <mdupont-away> i have a book 777 from crowley
12:35:20 <mdupont-away> it has hundereds of tables derived from the 23 alphabeth
12:35:37 <mdupont-away> hunderds of hashs, thousands, millions
12:35:46 <yottzumm> well, how would you structure your beliefs in opencyc?  Is it possible?
12:36:01 <mdupont-away> assertions of belief
12:36:09 <mdupont-away> this is a philosophical problem
12:36:19 <yottzumm> would you just write a function that peruses microtheories looking for coincidence?
12:36:23 <mdupont-away> the philosophers cover just that
12:36:37 <mdupont-away> very very simple
12:36:39 <mdupont-away> sort
12:36:55 <mdupont-away> a fitness function
12:37:04 <mdupont-away> genetic algorithm of life
12:37:16 <mdupont-away> 6*7=42
12:37:31 <yottzumm> I thought that was 6*9=42
12:37:45 <yottzumm> did you read all the books
12:37:57 <yottzumm> I recommend Foucault's Pendulum if you haven't read it yet.
12:38:04 <yottzumm> by Umberto Eco
12:38:15 --- nick: mdupont-away -> mdupont
12:38:23 <mdupont> i have read much more than that
12:38:32 <mdupont> eco is one of my favorites
12:38:44 <yottzumm> well I was just trying to come up with SimBelief
12:39:06 <mdupont> cool
12:39:16 <mdupont> i think that you can find something,
12:39:26 <mdupont> leibnitz, did not he cover that?
12:40:35 <yottzumm> I don't know, I haven't researched it much yet.  I didn't even take philosophy in college.  I was however raised a Christian, so I know about religious systems.
12:40:50 <yottzumm> do you have a web page on leibnitz?
12:41:39 * mdupont googles
12:41:44 <mdupont> . google
12:41:49 <mdupont> err
12:46:06 <mdupont> http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/courses/americanphil/peirce.html
12:46:17 <mdupont> peirce is good
12:47:01 <yottzumm> I have trouble reading books since my brain broke.
12:47:18 <yottzumm> broke after reading Foucault's Pendulum
12:47:34 <mdupont> http://www.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Philosophy/Kant/cpr/21met2-4.htm
12:47:39 <mdupont> kant
12:49:47 <mdupont> but i read now eco,
12:49:56 <mdupont> the platapus
12:49:59 <mdupont> book
12:50:09 <yottzumm> Is english the best language for describing beliefs?
12:50:25 <yottzumm> or other human language?
12:50:58 <yottzumm> should I be researching lojbun lojlan, or whatevetr
12:51:37 <yottzumm> http://www.lojban.org/
12:51:50 <mdupont> programs are statements of beliefs in some form
12:52:13 <yottzumm> right, I was thinking I my have to analyze algorithms of beliefs
12:52:28 <yottzumm> so I was thinking I needed some kind of language.
12:52:43 <yottzumm> but it would also be cool if I had a 3D representation
12:52:44 <mdupont> ok,
12:52:49 <mdupont> i have an idea for you
12:53:07 <mdupont> build an export from dia into a3d render format
12:53:15 <mdupont> they use xml for the output.
12:56:12 <yottzumm> I know what dia (the diagram tool).  Do you mean x3d and not a3d?
12:56:53 <yottzumm> so I could write some kind of belief module for dia to diagram beliefs?
12:58:17 <yottzumm> so if programs are a list of instructions, you think that beliefs are instructions for living?
12:58:28 <mdupont> programs are graphs
12:58:44 <mdupont> semantic networks, matixes of connections
12:59:45 <yottzumm> so you are thinking more declaratively than procedurally?
13:01:27 <yottzumm>  http://www.isce.edu/site/Moldoveanu_Heslin.pdf.
13:02:12 <yottzumm> sorry, that link isn't right
13:02:40 <yottzumm> http://216.239.53.100/search?q=cache:8JNqNwJ2h04C:www.isce.edu/site/Moldoveanu_Heslin.pdf+belief+taxonomy&hl=en&ie=UTF-8
13:05:20 <mdupont> yes
13:06:24 <yottzumm> so I was thinking that people could create their own little belief systems, and the computer and other players could challenge their beliefs
13:06:35 <mdupont> sounds good.
13:06:39 <yottzumm> or you could have several avatars with different belief systems
13:06:42 <mdupont> i believe in statement
13:06:56 <mdupont> and the beliefs could be expressed as a graph
13:07:00 <mdupont> and walked through
13:07:11 <mdupont> viewing the conditionals
13:07:27 <yottzumm> I think the relationships between beliefs would be the most important...how they build on each other
13:07:47 <yottzumm> so the relationships could be shown as a graph
13:08:30 <yottzumm> I haven't seen any graphical cyc tools yet, just the website.
13:08:51 <mdupont> you will like this
13:09:13 <mdupont> http://introspector.sourceforge.net/coopx/2002/12/07/coopx/coopx.png
13:09:27 <mdupont> i am writing a daml spec
13:09:32 <mdupont> an ontology
13:10:49 <yottzumm> cool
13:11:13 <mdupont> check out the graph
13:11:30 <mdupont> you can feed the graphviz software your beliefs as daml ontologoes
13:13:35 <yottzumm> I haven't looked at DAML much yet.  I have just tried to implement a crazy8s card game in opencyc.
13:15:45 <yottzumm> I don't have a clue how to represent "You shouldn't kill your neighbor, or you will be eternally punished" in opencyc
13:16:21 <yottzumm> implies doesn't carry the full weight of the belief
13:17:25 <yottzumm> Is there a morality module in cyc?
13:19:05 <mdupont> killing is bad?
13:19:35 <mdupont> http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~alison/ai3notes/subsection2_9_1_2.html
13:19:41 <mdupont> modal logic
13:22:09 <yottzumm> well, logic is easy enough.
13:23:38 <yottzumm> My statement however, contains a lot of sub beliefs, like the belief that your conscious lives on after your death, that you can physically kill someone etc
13:25:03 <yottzumm> I like the style that EGGG uses http://www.orwant.com/eggg.html
13:25:49 <yottzumm> but I've seen stuff like zillions of games and sol uses that looks promising as well
13:27:20 <yottzumm> appendix c contains the grammar
13:30:06 <yottzumm> I don't think that I can use cyc assertions to create beliefs.  Most people wouldn't accept that as an easy game to play
13:31:06 <yottzumm> so I think it's got to be a BDE (belief development environment)  hence the name SimBelief
13:31:39 <yottzumm> I can see people choosing from a list of beliefs
13:32:23 <yottzumm> maybe the system can generate beliefs based on current beliefs of the person, and also challenge the person at the same time
13:34:23 <yottzumm> Once people have chosing their initial set of beliefs, I could do something like you suggested.  Create a graph that shows relationships, and let them explore belief space
13:41:03 <yottzumm> When I talked to Dr. Orwant, he suggested that he would probably do wizards if he had to do it over again
