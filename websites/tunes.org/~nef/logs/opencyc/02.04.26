00:00:00 --- log: started opencyc/02.04.26
00:00:20 <SethR> interesting .. its not an explicit property, its burned into the system
00:01:26 <stevereed_home> well an essential property, reflected up into CycL - when I do my task
00:02:24 <stevereed_home> a read-only property
00:04:03 <SethR> hmmm ... ive been wavering whether to make it an implicit property or just anothe unique property in my memory ... i pretty much decided to make it explicit
00:04:42 <stevereed_home> i think i understand
00:05:14 <stevereed_home> for cyc the identity of a term is its guid
00:05:26 <stevereed_home> the name is simply a handle for humans
00:05:38 <stevereed_home> we have a test called the gensym test...
00:05:48 <SethR> in other words there will be an arrow from the node that represents Thing to the literal "Thing"
00:06:00 <stevereed_home> yes
00:06:22 <stevereed_home> when Germans use Cyc they'll be in German
00:06:30 <stevereed_home> and that will be the name for us too.
00:06:48 <stevereed_home> we will use NL generation to make it readable for English readers.
00:07:07 <stevereed_home> we have lexical assertions for terms
00:07:15 <stevereed_home> that default to the constant name.
00:07:24 <stevereed_home> but you can override them.
00:07:35 <stevereed_home> for any natural language.
00:08:43 <SethR> yep
00:09:27 <stevereed_home> I hope the WebOnt group addresses this issue.
00:09:27 * SethR goes to bed
00:09:33 <stevereed_home> sleepy too.
00:10:05 <SethR> personally i dont see the need for WebOnt ...now that we got OpenCy
00:10:30 <SethR> just more languages to translate amoung
00:11:12 <stevereed_home> you would have enjoyed Pat Hayes comment in the last DAML PI meeting...
00:11:25 <stevereed_home> he used to work at Cycorp years ago.
00:11:57 <stevereed_home> he knows that we solved many of the issues facing the rdf/daml ..
00:12:03 <SethR> well im a big Pat Hayes fan .. cant wait till they give us Common Logic
00:12:13 <stevereed_home> right
00:12:49 <stevereed_home> anyway I gave feedback to web ont for lexification and use of label
00:13:04 <stevereed_home> i want the uri to be meaningless, just identity
00:13:29 <SethR> cool
00:13:47 <stevereed_home> hope it works out.
00:14:14 <stevereed_home> we have published a lot of DAML for other darpa projects.
00:14:17 <SethR> in my system it's just an internal serial number ... never really seen from the outside ...
00:14:31 <stevereed_home> we had an internal number too
00:14:45 <stevereed_home> but guids are better because no collisions if independent authors.
00:15:13 <stevereed_home> our internal id is just a pointer good for that world build.
00:15:29 <SethR> i understand .. my system is designed for a single author .. not trying to be the exteranl consensual language
00:15:37 <stevereed_home> ok
00:15:45 <stevereed_home> easy to extend
00:16:08 <SethR> solves a whole lot of problems that way
00:16:37 <stevereed_home> Cyc at our office is one big system, via replication
00:16:46 <SethR> every system starts with a tablua rosa and educates by reading good stuff like open Cyc etc
00:17:07 <stevereed_home> have you seen our docs
00:17:37 <stevereed_home> we are going to publish the "Ontological Engineering Handbook"..
00:17:39 <SethR> pretty much .. waiting for the windows version before i really start playing
00:18:03 <stevereed_home> working on it.  Got a compile of the executable just this afternoon on NT.
00:18:18 <stevereed_home> You can use the public servers that I put up..
00:18:24 <stevereed_home> in the meantime.
00:20:23 <SethR> i havent totally worked out how my api is gonna interface with cyc ... one thing i want cyc to do for me is the logical entailments .. dont want to write an inference engine .. not at all
00:20:54 <stevereed_home> do you want subsumption inference or the whole thing.
00:21:33 <SethR> well dont know enought about it to know the diffeence
00:21:52 <stevereed_home> subsumption is what can be done with DAML 
00:22:08 <SethR> in which case id want the wohole thing
00:22:15 <stevereed_home> right.
00:22:39 <stevereed_home> when you get the
00:22:59 <stevereed_home> system on windows then you can try some asks
00:23:11 <stevereed_home> and check out the inference paths you need
00:23:48 <stevereed_home> we almost always work back from the asks to the facts and rules that need to be input.
00:23:58 <SethR> one thing is im pretty committed to python ..so i'd want a python interface module .. any talk of that?
00:24:25 <stevereed_home> lots
00:24:45 <SethR> eta?
00:24:45 <stevereed_home> talk now , but there is talent lining up.
00:24:56 <stevereed_home> within months.
00:25:03 <stevereed_home> that is as close as I can get.
00:25:28 <stevereed_home> because this is the first big effort by non-cycorp contributers.
00:25:50 <SethR> to make the python interface module?
00:25:57 <stevereed_home> right
00:26:02 <stevereed_home> I recommended,
00:26:24 <stevereed_home> a translation of org.opencyc.api and org.opencyc.cycobject classes
00:26:26 <stevereed_home> to python
00:26:37 <stevereed_home> but one python developer,
00:26:58 <stevereed_home> wants to write it from scatch using extensions of python built in classes.
00:26:58 <dmiles> pythion to java is super doable
00:27:10 <stevereed_home> so i understand.
00:27:46 <stevereed_home> I wrote the guts of the java api over a couple of weeks. with several months of 
00:27:51 <SethR> it =?= the whole inference engine ?
00:27:52 <stevereed_home> extending.
00:28:11 <stevereed_home> no, it simply exposes the server infernce engine via ask.
00:28:27 <stevereed_home> Cyc is about 1.6 million lines of translated C code.
00:28:37 <dmiles> well you could eigther make a API access sytem in python..
00:28:49 <stevereed_home> or.
00:29:10 <dmiles> or have it replicate all the objects
00:29:26 <stevereed_home> the object replication is better, that is what i did
00:29:29 <stevereed_home> with the java api
00:29:40 <stevereed_home> with cached proxies.
00:30:05 <stevereed_home> you can send strings to cyc "(...") and get answrs.
00:30:07 <dmiles> yeah python is robust enough to do that
00:30:11 <stevereed_home> like with CycLBot
00:30:23 <stevereed_home> but much better to create the objects, in the form
00:30:32 <stevereed_home> most convenient for programming.
00:31:36 <stevereed_home> anyway wife caught me at computer...
00:31:45 <stevereed_home> must return for domestic peace.
00:31:52 <stevereed_home> bye
00:32:23 <dmiles> :) g'night
00:32:30 <SethR> me too
00:34:01 <dmiles> goodnight as well
