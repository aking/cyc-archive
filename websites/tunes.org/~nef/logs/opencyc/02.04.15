09:29:10 <dmiles> good moirning
09:32:14 <Don> morning dmiles
09:32:30 <Don> afternoon here, actually
09:33:14 <Don> did you get your arity parameter passing issue worked out?
09:34:17 <dmiles> yes.. i use a string now
09:34:40 <Don> ah that would get around the issue
09:35:04 <dmiles> well i am converting some things into multivalue combo boxs 
09:35:48 <dmiles> whiuch mans that it ias possible for isa BinaryPredicate isa ObjectPRedicate
09:36:01 <dmiles> all from tghwe same combo box
09:36:37 <dmiles> the single select combobox just decides how many6 argIsa to show the user
09:36:48 <Don> sounds good
09:37:09 <dmiles> yeah.. jamud objects was completed last night
09:37:28 <dmiles> http://jamud.com/backup/jamud-alpha6/dist/docs/api/
09:37:58 <Don> I read your writeup on the logicmoo home page and in the opencyc forum, sounds interesting but intense
09:38:27 <dmiles> so today working on the jamud to DataMicrotheroy
09:39:21 <dmiles> it sounds intense but its not very difficulkt in the java context
09:39:39 <dmiles> but in the knowdge engineering sense there is alot of work
09:40:13 <Don> yep, but it seems that opencyc will "give you a good platform to stand on"
09:40:59 <dmiles> yes the problem withbt the provers i was writting is i could never have that solidness of API or infernce
09:41:26 <dmiles> opencyc takes away that horid burden
09:41:41 <Don> absolutely, as they say, Cyc was created to solve the logic "brittleness" problem
09:42:40 <dmiles> yes
09:45:03 <dmiles> what do you think would be in a single agent's Mt.. as in would it be his private variables?
09:48:55 <dmiles> the intense part.. what do you mean?
09:52:19 <Don> intense=the breadth/depth of knowledge/disciplines needed, the scope of the vision; I say, aim high - go far
09:53:25 <dmiles> yeah the cycL knowledge coverage I realize i cant do alone.. i at best can make a couple of demo rules and concepts and confirm the behave right in the Mud
09:54:04 <dmiles> maybe a couple non-player chariters like ashop keeping and a mad hatter
09:54:15 <dmiles> err shop keeper and a mad hatter
09:55:07 <Don> yep, someone to interact with whose environs are limited, but within the transactional settings described by opencyc
09:56:03 <dmiles> yes.. everything does fit into an assert/retract/query
09:56:38 <dmiles> and cyc is good at telling us if those succeeeded with why/why not
09:57:04 <Don> just popping over into the KB, opencyc can handle things like #$MonetaryExchangeOfUserRights
09:58:19 <Don> heading off to lunch here, good luck
09:58:30 <dmiles> yes there is a need with opoencyc to be be able to have a system for testing the engineering of a context
09:58:38 <dmiles> one difficulty with query is that infernece settings are not always easily decided
09:59:05 <dmiles> like backchain depths etc
09:59:15 <dmiles> enjoy lunch

12:46:18 <dmiles> hi thoes, i still havent found much Schank on the web.. been pretty busy
12:46:48 <theos> hmm
12:46:52 <theos> re dmiles
12:46:57 <theos> what a pitty
12:47:14 <theos> nothing to put in a nice mail for me :)
12:47:15 <dmiles> how did you like Sowa's stuff?
12:47:34 <theos> well, still reading, but I think it is just what I need to get warmed up :)
12:48:23 <dmiles> Schank is much older somewhat considered out of date.. but i liked the fact that he always put his ideas to practivcal implimentation
12:49:07 <dmiles> he was able to perform very good text-tological form
12:49:21 <dmiles> err -to-logicical form
12:50:02 <dmiles> his methods of roles and things however are subsummed by the Sowa works your are reading
12:50:47 <theos> good
12:51:04 <theos> then the linx you sent are what suffice?
12:51:12 <dmiles> i actually believe so
12:51:26 <dmiles> its good to have one context (author) to start with
12:52:45 <dmiles> they both use ptrans/atrans to show how to symbolize a script
12:53:00 <theos> well, hmm , how do I say...
12:53:19 <dmiles> when you parse engish or others its good to see if it fits into a known script
12:53:52 <theos> I do not want to go too much depth with the programming things, more the theoretical backgrounds, to then device a scheme for solving it, that means (at least i think) you have to have a basic fesability understanding of some languages and concepts
12:53:56 <theos> right?
12:54:46 <dmiles> yes you certainly will have an oerview and could conceptualize the code design on your own
12:55:01 <dmiles> thats what reading Sowa does for me
12:55:23 <theos> hehe, i think it does it for me too :)
12:55:33 <theos> great
12:55:36 <dmiles> when i read schank its more to glean the actual method
12:55:45 <theos> good
13:07:38 <theos> dmiles: enjoying your accounts?
13:09:15 <dmiles> yes, havent had much time to use them yet.. been writting a Java to cyc reifier
13:09:48 <dmiles>     public String toReification(Object object) {
13:09:50 <dmiles> 	if (object instanceof String) return "\""+object+"\"";
13:09:50 <dmiles> 	Class aclass = object.getClass();
13:09:50 <dmiles> 	if (isJavaReconstuctable(aclass)) return ""+object;
13:09:50 <dmiles> 	if (aclass.isArray()) {
13:09:50 <dmiles> 	    return "HYPCollectionOf-"+aclass.getName()+object.hashCode();
13:09:52 <dmiles>       	}
13:09:53 <dmiles> 	return "HYP-"+aclass.getName()+object.hashCode();
13:09:55 <dmiles>     }
13:10:33 <dmiles> so the Jamud can gert put into Cyc easier
13:11:11 <dmiles> i set myself real tight deadlines with logicmoo
13:11:54 <dmiles> but definately going to be getting my box up and need your shell to host documetnation and test from
13:13:28 <dmiles>     public boolean isJavaReconstuctable(Class aclass) {
13:13:28 <dmiles> 	if (aclass.isArray()) return false;
13:13:28 <dmiles> 	if ( aclass.isPrimitive()
13:13:28 <dmiles> 	     || (Modifier.isFinal(aclass.getModifiers()) && aclass.getDeclaredMethod("toString")!=null )) return true;
13:13:28 <dmiles> 	return false;
13:13:29 <dmiles>     }
13:14:35 <dmiles> should help decide if Cyc should get a hashcode ref or get a .toString()
13:15:53 <dmiles> i wonder if arrays though i i should handle them in Cyc
13:16:16 <dmiles> if i build a Set or whatever
13:16:36 <dmiles> i am not going to worry about propigating them back to java
13:16:42 <dmiles> at least now
13:17:20 <dmiles> but at least have a solid Object to CycL serization

14:14:52 <stevereed> I wait for opencyc bugs, problems or questions to be posed...
14:15:06 <stevereed> working on cyc-ml import right now
14:24:06 <dmiles> theos, nope just working on it ;P
14:24:51 <dmiles> steve.. sometimes constant creation fails due to a capitializating premutaion
14:25:17 <dmiles> is there a way to test if that the issue first?
14:25:44 <dmiles> or get the cliosest matches?
14:26:21 <dmiles> like "myOldConsTant" could be used to find "myOldConstant" 
14:27:07 <dmiles> so what it would be is makeCycConstant() but with a more informative APi excception
14:27:53 <dmiles> invalid chars, case premutuion, etc
14:30:02 <dmiles> do you see my issue as something other people would run into? or maybe i am not inspecting my exception enough it may already be telling me these things?
14:33:56 <dmiles> stevereed: import code is going to be written in Java?
14:51:06 <stevereed> I am writing the Cyc-ML import in SubL but expect to publish the source as the first subl code released
14:52:19 <dmiles> very nice, it will be a good model if i want to make object access happen in a tight loop of a subL module
14:52:53 <dmiles> s/titgh/inner
14:53:17 <dmiles> (soory java object access )(
14:53:59 <stevereed> right
14:54:55 <dmiles> did you see my question about making new constants?
14:55:12 <stevereed> yes..
14:55:27 <dmiles> is it just not me inspecting the error message?
14:55:47 <stevereed> not clear ...
14:56:00 <dmiles> for example:
14:56:12 <dmiles> if the constant ThisConstant is known
14:56:28 <dmiles> and i later try to makeCycConstant("thisConstant")
14:56:56 <dmiles> it API exceptions .. since it's trying to protect us
14:57:09 <stevereed> OK, I understand
14:57:19 <stevereed> you do find constant by name first
14:57:31 <stevereed> expecting it to fail
14:57:37 <stevereed> no error...
14:57:37 <dmiles> yes
14:57:42 <stevereed> returns nil
14:57:47 <dmiles> correct
14:57:53 <stevereed> let me look at the code
14:58:59 <dmiles> ussing getConstantId() == null
14:59:13 <stevereed> right..
14:59:29 <stevereed> getConstantByName () --> null if not found
14:59:48 <stevereed> then do the create
14:59:48 <dmiles> right.. confirming which i use for you
15:00:23 <dmiles> well mo0st of the time i use your makeCycConstant() that only creates it if needed
15:00:53 <dmiles> wait.. 
15:00:55 <dmiles> oops
15:01:03 <dmiles> no n/m
15:01:14 <dmiles> it still is a problem for me
15:01:33 <stevereed> how so
15:01:47 <dmiles> (cyc-create-new-permanent \"" + name + "\"))
15:02:13 <dmiles> it fials but i am not sure the exception details are clear
15:02:45 <dmiles> unless it is :)
15:02:58 <stevereed> hmm... let me try the command line
15:03:04 <dmiles> i am just asking if that exception has more then one reason possible
15:03:39 <dmiles> before i tear in and start inpecting the excetion detail string
15:03:43 <stevereed> The message text of the exception should be unambiguous
15:03:58 <stevereed> CycApiException covers many exceptions.
15:04:03 <dmiles> ok good.. any ideas how many reasons for failure?
15:04:18 <stevereed> Probably just the one...  already exists
15:04:39 <dmiles> is there a way to say it exists but with a differnt case?
15:05:18 <dmiles> an example.. try create the constant "agent"
15:05:54 <stevereed> I am getting nil when I try to recreate #$Dog from the command line, not an exception
15:05:54 <dmiles> it exceptions... but gives the same message as "Agent"
15:06:09 <dmiles> what about #$dog?
15:06:09 <stevereed> OK i will try agent
15:06:42 <stevereed> "dog" --> nil
15:06:47 <stevereed> not an error
15:06:59 <dmiles> ok .. does the dog exist as a constant?
15:07:05 <stevereed> yes ..
15:07:12 <dmiles> lemme check on mine
15:07:36 <stevereed> CYC(4): (constant-name #$Dog)
15:07:36 <stevereed>  --> "Dog"
15:08:48 <dmiles> [1] CYC(2): (constant-name #$dog)
15:08:48 <dmiles> Error: "dog" is not the name of a constant.
15:09:09 <stevereed> OK let me try that
15:09:10 <dmiles> but you cant create dog right?
15:09:18 <stevereed> right
15:10:00 <dmiles> its cyc protecting us from bad naming (case) i assume
15:10:39 <stevereed> OK, I think we have to catch the error when creating the name,
15:11:08 <stevereed> because getConstantByName is too precise
15:11:11 <dmiles> durring automated loading .. when it's making constants.. i look for the error.. but dont know if its bad naming or invalid name
15:11:46 <stevereed> There is an api call for valid constant name...  let me look it up
15:11:55 <dmiles> thank you
15:12:47 <stevereed> isValidConstantName()
15:12:57 <dmiles> :) right on
15:12:58 <stevereed> Let me see if it catches agent
15:13:54 <stevereed> just catches syntax
15:13:58 <dmiles> cool, if it ruturns is valid and yet wont let me make it i can figure it was a case ambiguaty
15:14:51 <dmiles> good, isValidConstantName() returns true for "agent"? 
15:15:59 <stevereed> So if create fails, the term must exist with different case, provided you did
15:16:15 <stevereed> getConstantByName first and that returned null
15:16:32 <dmiles> that works good for me then
15:16:55 <dmiles> when that happens durring auotmated load i'll append a default suffix or return error depending on what the user wanted
15:16:57 <stevereed> I'll look over the SubL source for constant and see if I can find a function to handle case.
15:17:26 <dmiles> maybe it would be good to be able to retrieve the conflkicting cased constant
15:18:22 <dmiles> (be able to tell the user (on my end)) your constant is already in KB with the name "blah"
15:19:31 <dmiles> its probly no fun to be grepping arround in subL ;P

18:16:24 <dmiles> still not good :p
18:16:29 <mark> Now I have a network card, and opencyc is working much better, but not perfectly.
18:17:48 <dmiles> ah
18:17:53 <mark> I am going through the exercizes on Microtheories, and attempting to create the constant NewYearsDay, it happened again.
18:18:11 <dmiles> i didnt see a reply on the list yet
18:18:15 <mark> I get a similar error on the xterm where I did run-cyc.

18:19:13 <mark> Yes, on the CYC(1) prompt
18:19:29 <dmiles> hrmm
18:19:56 <mark> I have a network card, but I cannot use it for communication, since I am still on dialup at home
18:20:10 <dmiles> that really shoulnt happen on the Cyc(1): prompt
18:20:27 <mark> Do I need to set up a fake network to make cyc happy?
18:20:36 <dmiles> it has to be based on cyc trying to report to some other internet location
18:20:56 <dmiles> makeby so.. but it should use lo
18:21:09 <mark> I notice that my dialup activity graph shows activity every time I do something,
18:21:12 <dmiles> however if it was me right now i might try to tcpdump..
18:21:23 <dmiles> to see if cyc is soliciting any connetions
18:21:44 <mark> Oh yes, another linux tool I need to learn. This is a good time.
18:21:51 <dmiles> if so i would try to figurte out where it was trying to go

18:22:18 <mark> Yes, I am talking to you
18:22:29 <mark> on the same box
18:22:32 <dmiles> i mean is normal use creatinbg tcp traffic?
18:22:38 <dmiles> ok yes it would be
18:23:10 <dmiles> you may want to type tcp dump now (w/o cyc running and look for a common string to grep pout)
18:23:33 <mark> I will look at tcp dump for a while. Maybe if I just use ifconfig to make 'eth0' 'UP'...
18:23:35 <dmiles> like 'ircd'
18:23:45 <mark> Maybe I did that last time... doh...
18:24:21 <dmiles> tcpdump -a |grep -v ircd
18:24:46 <dmiles> -a means show ascii
18:25:10 <dmiles> well first w/o the -a
18:25:31 <dmiles> then you see all non irc stuff

18:26:17 <dmiles> and sopmeone is booting up on my network
18:27:36 <mark> Yes, I will play with that stuff and get back to you. I am also going to try ifconfig eth0 up and restart cyc.
18:28:42 <dmiles> yeah
18:30:05 <mark> Yes turning the eth0 interface on helped, as I said, doh...
18:30:38 <mark> But I will look at tcpdump later, after dinner.

22:20:08 <stevereed_home> trying to get one of the public cyc servers back online
22:20:24 <stevereed_home> seems it hasnt been powered off for months
22:20:37 <stevereed_home> and a new kernel is getting installed that
22:20:52 <stevereed_home> doesnt have my ethernet driver properly installed
22:21:00 <stevereed_home> either rebuild a new kernel or
22:21:01 --- join: bruce (~bruce@dnvrdslgw17poold45.dnvr.uswest.net) joined #opencyc
22:21:10 <stevereed_home> get the old one back
22:21:34 <stevereed_home> yes I would like to browse what you have
22:23:39 <dmiles> i have it making a class ontoloigy automatically to describe the instance data for each object.. finishing the Field access asseert and getSomeName asseret into cyc
22:24:01 <dmiles> new kernel .. Redhat ?
22:24:12 <dmiles> well kernel is not distribution specific ;P
22:24:20 <dmiles> but are you ussing redhat?
22:38:28 <stevereed_home> mandrake compiled for athlon
22:38:59 <dmiles> right on
22:39:02 <stevereed_home> left out lan driver so I am reverting to the mandrake 8.0 distributed kernel
22:39:29 <dmiles> ah.. well it's not so bad.. they at least dont distribute the least common denomitor
22:39:44 <stevereed_home> will have to remake eventually to support over 1 GB RAM
22:40:02 <dmiles> you get at least greater then a p-II support
22:40:15 <stevereed_home> yes
22:40:29 <dmiles> really? i have a gig in my redhat 7.1 machine
22:40:54 <dmiles> i should look into that
22:41:39 <dmiles> well i am right at a gig but was going to add a remaining 512M
22:42:17 <dmiles> you have a 266 mhz bus in there?
22:55:01 <dmiles> yay.. i am finally compiling out all my errors
