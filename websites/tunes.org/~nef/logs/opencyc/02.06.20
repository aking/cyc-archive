03:00:09 <dmiles> good morning Yepster
03:00:17 <dmiles> sorry i dropped offline the other day
03:00:37 <dmiles> my internet service was interupted for quite a few dasy
03:03:25 <Yepster> morning
03:04:06 <Yepster> I still have to scan a pack of copies
03:04:23 <dmiles> well i read the first 5 pages
03:05:05 <Yepster> do you know fi-justify a bit?
03:05:32 <dmiles> i havent used it yet.. but i asume it uses prevous query results?
03:05:43 <dmiles> or is ait a query that saves a trace?
03:05:49 --- join: CycLBot (cyc@12-225-207-235.client.attbi.com) joined #opencyc
03:07:03 <Yepster> subl: (fi-ask '(#$isa #$France #$GeopoliticalEntity) #$InferencePSC)
03:07:04 <CycLBot> (((T . T)))
03:07:28 <Yepster> subl: (fi-justify '(#$isa #$France #$GeopoliticalEntity) #$InferencePSC)
03:07:29 <CycLBot> no answers found
03:07:56 <dmiles> that is a NIL paraphrase
03:08:03 <Yepster> it's not described in the api documentation. When using it from the subl interactor
03:08:20 <Yepster> the answer is :queued. So I assume somewhere the justification must be given.
03:08:36 <Yepster> but don't know how to get anything from that d*mn queue
03:08:51 <dmiles> i thionk you use a :queued accessor Subl functs
03:09:03 <dmiles> yeah eaxcacly.. it there somehow :)
03:09:36 <dmiles> looking at some things in the java code i can see some small amounts of global accessing type merthods
03:10:05 <dmiles> for example ask-template stores things into some structures
03:10:14 <dmiles> the wrapper gets from it
03:11:06 <dmiles> wait n/m there is no wrapper
03:12:00 <Yepster> you mean in the cycaccess.askwithvariables method e.g.?
03:12:29 <dmiles> thats what i was thinking that it puts it into a :TEMPLATE
03:13:04 <dmiles> but looking there i dont see anything arround it other then setting options
03:13:47 <dmiles> but Steve mentioned is was put into a special template
03:14:18 <dmiles> >   "Ask SENTENCE in MT.  Return results of substituting bindings into TEMPLATE."
03:14:28 <dmiles> ok the variabnle present the "template"
03:14:39 <dmiles> its not a specialcl cache 
03:15:25 <dmiles> maybe we'll find something in UnitTest code
03:15:36 <Yepster> yes, but ask template has the variable to put the result into as parameter. fi-justify doesn't
03:16:29 <dmiles> subl: (fi-eval '(+ 1 1))
03:16:30 <CycLBot> org.opencyc.api.CycApiException: (S#21632 :MESSAGE "Operator FI-EVAL is not defined in the API")
03:20:08 <Yepster> I hope Steve's answer won't be: 0.7 or 1.0
03:20:46 <dmiles> well i thought it was you and i that asked Steve initally about FI-PROIVE
03:21:05 <dmiles> which had been spawned by our interest in getting a proof tree
03:21:55 <dmiles> he said there currently wasnt any good way to get from the API
03:22:09 <dmiles> buty i have this feeling 0.7 is comming out at end of this month
03:22:49 <Yepster> yeah I encountered the need for justification before.
03:22:55 <dmiles> only gleaning that from the email talking about the windows port would be ready for release end of this month
03:23:25 <dmiles> and that the things hoilding up 0.7 is just making the CycML work exactly the way wanted
03:24:16 <dmiles> ery good work
03:24:17 <dmiles> [16:21] <stevereed> we are waiting for the cycml-parser before the next release.
03:24:17 <dmiles> [16:21] <stevereed> I have the cycml generator working.
03:24:46 <dmiles> so it seems like the 'loader' portion is the current work
03:25:20 <dmiles> .7 i am hoping has:
03:25:28 <dmiles> - more SubL exposed
03:25:33 <Yepster> hmm if that's the only thing. To me it doesn't sound that difficult + xml parser + some cycl generation
03:26:09 <dmiles>  - ability to work a sigle task in a sub environemnt
03:26:14 <Yepster> yes, next to me sitting right now is a lisp guy, and he wasn't that happy with the lisp functionality in subl
03:26:35 <dmiles> well i think it was just security based exportation
03:26:37 <Yepster> I am waiting for the planner
03:26:49 <Yepster> or at least kb contents for the planner
03:26:59 <dmiles> i tried to make a planning system in CycL..
03:27:14 <dmiles> let me show you the data
03:29:04 <dmiles> follow the links relared to desires: http://12.225.207.235:8036/cgi-bin/cyccgi/cg?cb-c-all-asserted-knowledge&-623
03:29:49 <dmiles> wait this is better: http://12.225.207.235:8036/cgi-bin/cyccgi/cg?cb-content-frame&2973
03:30:12 <dmiles> (the misslainous references)
03:31:27 <dmiles> meaning they follow causes-PropProp rules they make from (ist theirMentalMt (implies ....)
03:31:33 <dmiles> anyways its flops ;P
03:31:55 <dmiles> was just a one hour experment
03:32:33 <dmiles> but the idea was they want certain arbitrary propostions to be true
03:33:03 <dmiles> and they have a scoped viewpoint of casues prop prop
03:33:04 <Yepster> I am not sure I understand
03:33:32 <dmiles> and then typing in the state changes based on Event that is Transformational
03:34:19 <dmiles> so they could query which events could help them transition or circumvernt conventional implications
03:34:32 <dmiles> denoted by #$implies
03:34:35 <Yepster> btw do you know (constant-apropos "substring") ? very handy

03:36:31 <dmiles> nice
03:36:44 <dmiles> i have been lookig for a search!
03:37:39 <Yepster> I think I would put al the things an agent believes in an mt, instead of thinksprobable
03:37:53 <Yepster> I think
03:38:09 <dmiles> well that thinks proable is 'ist'ed to only one Mt
03:38:20 <Yepster> But I'm very curious how the planner ontology models the plan-state-action stuff
03:38:46 <dmiles> (implies 
03:38:46 <dmiles>        (and 
03:38:46 <dmiles>            (authorityForMt ?WHO ?MT)

03:39:11 <dmiles> the ?WHO variable help Scope the (authorityForMt ?WHO ?MT) 
03:40:04 <dmiles> but definately
03:40:12 <Yepster> So this says, if the authoriy in jamudmt thinks something, it's true in jamudt
03:40:29 <dmiles> only for him
03:40:46 <Yepster> ah ok yes, the thinksProbable
03:41:19 <Yepster> no..
03:41:21 <dmiles> yeah thats kinda like a spindle
03:41:44 <dmiles> so eveykne shows up in one place
03:41:46 <Yepster> if something is true in the mt, the authority thinks it's true
03:42:05 <dmiles> the ist is the Mt constaint
03:42:23 <dmiles> ?WHO still cant see JamudMt
03:42:57 <dmiles> Jamud is just a single place to ask about ?Who and stor eauthorityFors
03:43:01 <Yepster> lunch, ttyl8r
03:43:23 <dmiles> i'll be here
03:43:35 <Yepster> btw, what time is it over there?
03:43:42 <dmiles> 3:49 Am
03:43:58 <dmiles> your time?
03:44:05 <dmiles> time
03:44:06 <CycLBot> the time was Wed Jun 19 20:22:51 PDT 2002
03:44:21 <Yepster> 12:44
03:44:21 <dmiles> oh heck that darn server ;P
03:44:28 <dmiles> ah 
03:44:40 <Yepster> insomnia?
03:45:00 <dmiles> rotated sleep scedule.. every time i have it right it moves forward 8 hours
03:45:18 <dmiles> so my mind is one a 32 hour schedule
03:45:35 <Yepster> i had something similar the 2nd year of study, when I stopped following classes
03:46:07 <Yepster> but the skew stopped at 3 am
03:46:23 <dmiles> yeah eveytime you get a good 6 am wakeup time it becomes your bedtime the next day :P
03:47:02 <humhut-away> some research has shown that some people have a natural cycle of 48 hrs
03:47:18 <humhut-away> but my attempts to live so failed
03:48:03 <humhut-away> ~Michael Siffre is a caver/researcher who made these experiments
03:48:04 <dmiles> i think todfays society of lack of physical stress allows ur inconsitancies like this to manefest better
03:48:16 <dmiles> err our 
03:48:47 <humhut-away> (if I spell his name right)
03:49:03 <dmiles> some of us end up replicating those below ground experments :)
03:49:17 * humhut-away nods.
03:49:49 <dmiles> lack of normal sunlight maybe.. thats what he used i think?
03:49:51 <humhut-away> I know several men/women who often work during 35...50 hours, at the pc.
03:49:56 <humhut-away> uninterrupted
03:50:14 <humhut-away> i am included (tried 4 times or so).
03:50:29 <dmiles> well i can go about 24 max.. it gets tio the point you are ballancing so many uinterfaces you are afraid to sleep or break concintration
03:50:39 <humhut-away> Siffre et co. excluded any clock devices...
03:51:17 <humhut-away> (that's funny, one work week at once.)
03:51:39 <dmiles> hrrm maybe that wouild be nice to bill the hourly and get it all done
03:52:26 <humhut-away> I'm billed hourly, some other people i mentioned are self-employed
03:52:58 <dmiles> works well :)
03:53:19 * humhut-away smiles and gets back away.
03:53:54 <dmiles> well i am going to nap for an hour or two.. hopefully will be up when everyone else in this channel is

08:39:27 <Graham> you mea, asserttions that are added to the local queue?

09:42:33 <stevereed> Yepster: you cannot get results directly from queued interactions - they are 
09:42:44 <stevereed> performed by a background process - the agenda.
09:43:15 <stevereed> However I can add to the api an underlying function that is not queued for any function such as
09:43:31 <stevereed> fi-justify.  Just let me know which ones you need.
09:43:52 <Yepster> well I think i need fi-justify
09:43:52 <stevereed> Cyc should support Unicode. But I have not tested it.
09:44:14 <Yepster> but don't know, because I haven't seen results if it yet
09:44:40 <Yepster> I need the list that's in the browser interface after 'justification 1 of xx' etc
09:46:15 <stevereed> When you submit fi-justify through the api port it should return immediately. Try a telnet connection.
09:46:45 <stevereed> we have a behavior wrapper on api calls to make them not use the background processing.
09:48:12 <Yepster> trying..
09:48:59 <Yepster> hmm just returns NIL

17:27:10 <CycLBot> hello johnd
17:27:20 <johnd> hello dmiles
17:27:21 <CycLBot> hello johnd
17:27:32 <johnd> you said that already, CycLBot.
17:27:45 <dmiles> :)
17:27:54 <johnd> Doug, did you get my email?
17:28:04 <dmiles> just replied
17:28:08 <johnd> ok
17:28:48 <dmiles> sometimes my mail server gets rejected becasue my address doesnt get matched to the smtp domainname
17:29:08 <johnd> in response to your email...
17:29:19 <johnd> Why don't you try out the doc.
17:29:37 <dmiles> definately will :_) even tonioght!
17:29:37 <johnd> If it seems useful, you don't have to hold back from sharing it.
17:30:17 <dmiles> that subl call is presently in .6 ?
17:30:24 <johnd> Send me any revisions or comments, though.
17:30:38 <johnd> I've heard it is, but I haven't tried it.
17:31:53 <johnd> We may put out 0.7 without CycML import. Depends on timing. Hard to get good help these days. Hell, it's hard to get ANY programming help.
17:32:39 <dmiles> hehe.. its scarey how few programmers out there have a strong background in propostiional logic concepts at all
17:32:55 <johnd> That reminds me...
17:33:32 <johnd> We should include some links to general educational resources (web sites, books?) that deal with propositional logic.
17:34:02 <johnd> We should a link to a page of links on the Documentation page.
17:34:17 <johnd> should a link --> should put a link
17:34:40 <dmiles> Yes, you and I (at least me :)) take for granted that people have knowledge in basic principles like quantifiers and and skolems
17:35:39 <dmiles> but the nice thing about the planner is there are excelent reseaources decribing the concepts of how a state->action->statye planner works
17:36:03 <johnd> Give me links! I'll include them in the doc.
17:36:31 <johnd> Email them to me, would be best.
17:37:13 <dmiles> ok definately
17:37:34 <johnd> I'm working on an intro screen to send new users to when they first open the KB Browser.
17:37:47 <johnd> It will have links to walkthroughs.
17:38:05 <johnd> We're adding the Compose tool to OpenCyc.
17:38:24 <johnd> It is a tool that was removed as part of the 'don't use KE-Text' policy.
17:38:37 <dmiles> :)
17:38:51 <johnd> So now you will be able to type (or paste) KE-Text into a text field and then submit.
17:39:06 <dmiles> will you have pages that help guide the creation of a predicate and collections?
17:39:09 <johnd> There will still be no import/export of KE Text.
17:39:11 --- quit: dash ("starcraft time!")
17:39:30 <johnd> Yes, in the walkthroughs, yes.
17:40:42 <dmiles> you saw: http://12.225.207.235:8080/logicmoo/createpredicate.jsp ?
17:40:48 <dmiles> (its updated)
17:41:01 <johnd> With the compose screen and the walkthroughs, there can be an example that requires creation of 10 constants and 5 assertions (for example), and you can copy them from the walkthrough "article", paste them in, and submit them all at once.
17:41:32 <dmiles> ah good.. becasue you can assert multple definatines with (#$and ... ... ... )
17:42:16 <dmiles> err or one at a time
17:43:01 <johnd> Yes, but the CREATEs are hard to do that way, right?
17:43:13 <dmiles> thats my opion
17:43:21 <dmiles> opinion
17:43:48 <johnd> I think it's a fact, right or wrong (but I think right).
17:44:02 <johnd> Without Compose, you have to create each constant individually.
17:44:14 <dmiles> becasue it requires human persistantly rembering the proceedure when that could all be put into a page
17:44:44 <johnd> That makes it tough when you're trying to demonstrate something with a bunch of quickly added instances.
17:45:03 <johnd> Even in a page, you've got to fill it out.
17:45:04 <dmiles> ah i see so Compose very simular to KE-Text 
17:45:15 <johnd> Here's a way to paste and go.
17:45:31 <johnd> Compose IS KE Text. Just not import of a KE Text file.
17:45:39 <dmiles> ah i see :)
17:46:10 <johnd> Back to the walkthroughs...
17:46:15 <johnd> What all should be included
17:46:28 <johnd> One has been craeted for us by an OEer here.
17:46:40 <johnd> It's long. About an hour to go through.
17:47:08 <johnd> It includes creation of some constants (I think instances, collections and predicates).
17:47:19 <johnd> Then it includes some very simple GAFs.
17:47:44 <johnd> We should (probably could) break up the long one into pieces.
17:48:04 <johnd> But they'll have to be gone about in order.
17:48:31 <dmiles> i see
17:48:53 <johnd> My main criticism of it so far is it isn't about anything useful. It's just about two cats.
17:49:06 <dmiles> an hour is not that long
17:49:08 <johnd> I'd like to have one to follow it that sort of does something useful.
17:49:41 <johnd> I was thinking about something where you ontologize several events that represent chores.
17:50:00 <johnd> You say it's not that long, but you're very patient.
17:50:03 <dmiles> well yes, its interesting becasue we want people to come out of the examples with something they can apply
17:50:22 <johnd> This is for people who skipped the docs and went straight to running the program.
17:50:27 <johnd> About the chores...
17:50:32 <dmiles> even making a sandwitch within a planning domain would be usefull
17:50:42 <johnd> Yes.
17:50:58 <johnd> You could add some rules to characterize the chores.
17:51:26 <johnd> So, the KB would identify chores that have to be done at home, chores that can't be done in the morning, etc.
17:51:34 <johnd> Then it helps you prioritize.
17:51:42 <johnd> I wanted to show this without the planner
17:51:57 <johnd> so that we can see the usefulness of inference first.
17:52:07 <johnd> regular inference
17:52:13 <johnd> deduction
17:52:25 <dmiles> yes looks like defining the chores could lead to infernce without planning
17:52:48 <johnd> it would get them into entering rules
17:52:56 <johnd> probably
17:53:11 <johnd> I haven't figured out how we'd handle sorting
17:53:26 <johnd> Maybe classifying is enough.
17:53:35 <dmiles> you mean ordering output of chore list?

17:54:18 <johnd> sorry for horrible name
17:54:30 <dmiles> yes.. that works
17:55:22 <dmiles> that certainly is more inspiring then defining furry cats
17:55:42 <johnd> Well, one would be to learn the nuts and bolts
17:55:52 <johnd> The next would be to get more down to business
17:57:21 <dmiles> yotzum was wor4king on definining the rules of a card game and thinking up ways to write an application arround it
17:57:49 <johnd> Anything like that, I want to see.
17:58:09 <johnd> If you talk to him, let him know, please.
17:58:46 <dmiles> yes.. i know he has alot of java code he wrote arround uirt
17:58:52 <dmiles> err it
17:59:07 <johnd> If the planner works in 0.6, you can do the sandwich example.
17:59:19 <dmiles> definetly.. would love to
17:59:32 <johnd> I'll include it (with a credit, if you like) in the walkthroughs.
18:00:20 <dmiles> yes .. i'll check real quicjk something to see
18:01:14 <dmiles> looks like the API command is not defined
18:01:36 <dmiles> i think it could just be a SubL visiablity issue
18:02:25 <dmiles> alot of commands that even Steve thought would be defined that are basic to SubL was not exported into the Cified pe3nCyc
18:03:20 <dmiles> alot of cross-compliers do things like that (leave things out not explicitly defined)

20:15:18 --- quit: Psion ("sleep")
20:24:42 <humhut-away> hmm
20:25:15 <humhut-away> if the moo is active, then propagating changes would cause traffic too big for the internet
20:26:16 <humhut-away> so cycdb instance must be local.

20:55:20 <CycLBot> You "said, "i think its most usefull that way""
20:56:06 <dmiles> but my interaction with Cyc is over the CycAccess java which does not have to be local
20:56:36 <dmiles> but local as in the data is local
20:57:02 <dmiles> the application believes the data is local (even though really in Cyc))
20:57:47 <humhut-away> i mean, the situation is not possible, when cyc is here and moo is on the other side of planet
20:58:34 <humhut-away> also, in the actively changin environment, there will be many conflicts...
20:59:11 <humhut-away> which will interfere with inference
20:59:12 <humhut-away> etc
20:59:32 <dmiles> well thats the tjhing i first ran into with Jamud.. that there was a propogation every few minutes
20:59:55 <humhut-away> and?
21:00:09 * dmiles is multitasking
21:00:15 <humhut-away> ok.
21:00:24 <humhut-away> you're at work, and i am not.
21:00:25 <dmiles> say well you see me in two wiindows :)
21:00:25 <CycLBot> You "said, "well you see me in two wiindows )""
21:00:37 <humhut-away> ahh
21:02:21 <dmiles> ok the propogation issue
21:03:19 <dmiles> say it became easier to replace the moo's get/set methods
21:03:19 <CycLBot> You "said, "it became easier to replace the moo's get/set methods""
21:04:14 <dmiles> say just a few more minurtes ;P
21:04:15 <CycLBot> You "said, "just a few more minurtes ;P""
21:04:17 <dmiles> oopps
21:04:27 <dmiles> see i dont multitask well 
21:06:56 <dmiles> well then after working with te get/sets.. then started replacing the getArrayCollectiohnsOfItems
21:07:27 <dmiles> but then java expected to maniputate these objects that represtne d colections
21:07:35 <dmiles> so i have to make a CycFort map
21:07:46 <dmiles> err had to
21:08:13 <dmiles> so when cyc deduced the fact there where more in the collection.. it wouldn't show up
21:08:35 <dmiles> so i started completely ussing cyc as the only broker of data
21:09:02 <dmiles> say so things like 'look' and 'move nortth' only have side effects in Cyc
21:09:02 <CycLBot> You "said, "so things like 'look' and 'move nortth' only have side effects in Cyc""
21:09:19 <dmiles> so it sort of replaced the whole moo
21:09:45 <dmiles> say players life in a the moo was just a client that used cyc and persisted nothing on their own
21:09:45 <CycLBot> You "said, "players life in a the moo was just a client that used cyc and persisted nothing on their own""
21:10:42 <dmiles> but if their is a moo kernel thats really awesome its worth the effort to replacing all of its methods with cyc proxiy assert/rretract
21:11:13 <dmiles> humhut-away, you following?
21:11:25 <humhut-away> yes
21:11:45 <dmiles> so i stoped trying to sychronize
21:11:55 <dmiles> and only client Cyc as the authority of data
21:12:05 <humhut-away> ok
21:12:16 <dmiles> which doesnt have to really be local
21:12:45 <humhut-away> So, the moo is actually a lightweight client of the cyc db.
21:13:00 <dmiles> exactly
21:13:13 <humhut-away> and can contain no db at all.
21:13:13 <dmiles> make the DB look more like a world
21:13:18 <humhut-away> or must.
21:13:32 <dmiles> right in a way it must not
21:13:40 <humhut-away> moo cannot contain any db at all.
21:13:50 <dmiles> right 
21:14:22 <dmiles> at least to work well
21:14:46 <humhut-away> i would guess, to work at all
21:14:47 <dmiles> sycronization is still to a moo that holds it own db
21:14:56 <humhut-away> oops
21:14:56 <dmiles> err is still possible
21:15:09 <dmiles> only possible but hard 
21:15:39 <dmiles> so  <humhut-away> moo cannot contain any db at all.
21:15:41 <humhut-away> i.e. cyc data can be converted into a moo db.   But moo cannot use this moodb.
21:15:42 <dmiles> works best
21:16:02 <dmiles> actualyl it can work both ways
21:16:06 <humhut-away> how!
21:16:13 <humhut-away> there will be conflicts!
21:16:18 <dmiles> that syncronization can puch to cyc.. i did that in on off the files in CVS
21:16:23 <humhut-away> moo cannot rely on obsolete moodb!
21:16:37 <dmiles> yeah thats why it was ugly and hard to maintian
21:16:50 <dmiles> every few seconds you basicly had to rebuild the whole moo db
21:17:05 <humhut-away> in active enviroment, one'll end up with lots of false assertions...

21:18:02 <dmiles> but definately would have
21:18:32 <dmiles> on top of that was a messaging system to say "joe entered the room"
21:18:42 <dmiles> that messaging was only client to client
21:19:17 <dmiles> so roomSend(myRoom,"joe entered the room")
21:19:24 <dmiles> thats how it still works

21:20:48 <dmiles> telnet://12.225.207.235:4444/

21:38:22 <dmiles> trying to decide how much time to devote to this i am
21:38:31 * humhut-away should go do some mundane work
21:38:43 <humhut-away> is this your mainjob or what?
21:38:57 <dmiles> no this is just a very important hobbie to me ;P
21:39:44 <dmiles> i see that it will make alot of things more possible
21:39:57 <humhut-away> like what?
21:40:12 <dmiles> for example if we ever did want to pass a turning test one would need some kind of instanciated life
21:40:23 <dmiles> err turring test chatbot
21:40:40 <dmiles> they would need to have a frame of refernce
21:41:12 <dmiles> that was in ways simular .. i know that this is not the fastest way thoigh
21:41:36 <dmiles> also if someone created input devices to monitor an office..
21:41:53 <dmiles> they would rather put their data into something that looked/felt like an office
21:42:28 <dmiles> so by creating virtual human spaces, it improves how we can infernce 
21:42:57 <dmiles> because we have a secondary way to represent things
21:43:43 * humhut-away feels lost in AI. No prob.
21:43:49 <dmiles> also if we awanted to get cyc to play chess it might be easier to set up a chessboard in a moo
21:44:39 <dmiles> then you leverage all the presentation programs written for moos]
21:44:53 <humhut-away> huhu
21:45:22 <humhut-away> how it can play chess
21:45:25 <dmiles> thats why i think its somewhat important to have some system for doing it
21:45:53 <dmiles> well cyc can play chess from its rules and interfacing to a planning context
21:45:53 <humhut-away> does cyc have a way to access outside solvers?
21:46:29 <humhut-away> i guess cyc will lose a battle with deep blue
21:46:32 <dmiles> there is i think a solver that cyc has access to already.. its a matter of making things more interfacable
21:47:18 <dmiles> i could see at least a socket interface for calling on another sovler would be nice
21:47:33 <dmiles> lossing a battle with deepblue why?
21:47:42 <humhut-away> at least, i guess, such interfaces are possible to implement.
21:47:46 <humhut-away> are they?
21:47:59 <humhut-away> so that cyc will be able to access them
21:48:02 <dmiles> i believe they are very possible to implement
21:48:06 <humhut-away> e.g. on demand
21:48:08 <humhut-away> ok
21:48:27 <dmiles> cyc can call them with EvaluateSubLFn inside an antecedddant rule
21:49:33 <dmiles> so you can make a rule  (imples (EvaluateSubLFn my code with vars) (someCycPred ?X ?Y)
21:49:48 <humhut-away> e.g. i think cyc will not be able to answer "estimate the speed of newton's apple."
21:50:00 <humhut-away> external solver will be necessary
21:50:09 <dmiles> http://12.225.207.235:8036/cgi-bin/cyccgi/cg?cb-cf&8415  <- a code rule i wrote
