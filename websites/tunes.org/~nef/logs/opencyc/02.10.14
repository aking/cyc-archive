00:00:00 --- log: started opencyc/02.10.14
00:00:13 <dmiles> these instincts make us create new goals constantly.. many are timed
00:00:33 <dmiles> some are made to cycle in whikle anpother cycles out
00:01:07 <dmiles> thats what makes us inteliegnet i belive
00:01:29 <fleeky> me to , to a certain extent but i have to wonder if theres anything missing
00:01:39 <dmiles> just that we are trying to satisfiy goals
00:01:57 <dmiles> i cant think of anything except meory loss
00:02:09 <dmiles> err memory loss and masking
00:02:10 <fleeky> sometimes there irrational 
00:02:24 <fleeky> like something comes into your life and makes you act completely different
00:02:33 <dmiles> masking is where the organism adapts to a particular noise
00:03:08 <fleeky> what about when the noise affects the organism
00:03:14 <fleeky> noise, or other organism.. 
00:03:18 <dmiles> well yes.. being constantly altered is what happens when you are working through goal states
00:04:01 <dmiles> well that is pathology.. whne the organism masks a nouierather then treating it as input
00:04:18 <dmiles> but thats what makes us imperfect
00:04:24 <dmiles> one ofthe things
00:04:51 <dmiles> which is linked to the thalimic attention.. temporary controlled masking 
00:04:57 <fleeky> i think imperfection is essential, cause something perfect wouldnt need to improve and would hence never improve
00:05:06 <fleeky> thalimic attention?
00:05:07 <dmiles> which is in expert system a heuristic
00:05:49 <dmiles> mind tried to amplify certain signals at times perposely.. thatspart of the thamlomus
00:06:13 <fleeky> oh ok 
00:06:52 <fleeky> it tries to amplify signals to reach goals .. that emotions coerce the brain into
00:07:26 <dmiles> yeah and then the emotions mistampthe consequent memory
00:07:43 <fleeky> and thats why it seems irrational?
00:07:52 <fleeky> because it guessed and stamped the wrong emot
00:07:52 <dmiles> i believe so
00:07:54 <fleeky> emotion?
00:07:55 <fleeky> hmmm
00:07:57 <dmiles> and also created
00:08:01 <fleeky> thats a good theory atleast :) 
00:08:03 <dmiles> err creative
00:08:26 <dmiles> i havent found another implimentatio theory other then this
00:08:59 <fleeky> ever heard of the cemi field theory?
00:09:10 <dmiles> what is it about?
00:09:23 <dmiles> the 100th monkey?
00:09:36 <fleeky> it tries to explain synaptic neuron firing by saying that the electromagnetic field surrounding the brain actually affects the firing of neurons
00:09:48 <fleeky> and the neurons firing conversly effect the em field
00:10:11 <dmiles> yes.. i beove that effect is effecting other things that occilate at the same frequescies
00:10:44 <dmiles> for example spiders vibrate at the same speeds as human respiarttion brain waves
00:10:58 <fleeky> well that could be coincidence
00:11:23 <fleeky> there all very logical theories .. but again i still think they need testing 
00:11:36 <fleeky> although you can always test it with opencyc probably :) 
00:11:49 <dmiles> they did a study with mesquitos.. they tortured some behind a wall.. when they did the children on the other side started to play more violently
00:12:14 <fleeky> hmm
00:12:23 <fleeky> what was the percentage?
00:12:35 <dmiles> i belive its due to the asicic occilitory frequencies
00:12:57 <dmiles> i think it was always 100%
00:13:11 <fleeky> well the em field of the brain doesnt reach very far from the skull though
00:13:15 <dmiles> oh but of the children. i am sure its generitics
00:13:19 <fleeky> like it barely leaves it 
00:13:24 <fleeky> its only slightly surrounding it
00:13:39 <fleeky> yeah , i mean did they leave the children alone?
00:13:42 <fleeky> maybe thats why
00:13:44 <dmiles> yes.. well our brains have been carefull to conceal certain waves
00:13:54 <fleeky> which waves?
00:14:02 <dmiles> no it was a very controlled experment
00:14:05 <fleeky> and what are asicic occilitory frequencies
00:14:44 <dmiles> well partually the atomic wiehgth and bandwidth
00:15:12 <dmiles> then densitiy ofmass and vbarious things
00:15:53 <dmiles> not all things will travel distances.. but some things are not distance bound
00:16:31 <dmiles> for example biosignatures travel about 10 feet max
00:16:31 <fleeky> like entangled particles?
00:16:40 <fleeky> biosignatures like heat?
00:16:45 <fleeky> smell?
00:17:17 <dmiles> well it is doneby charging disemdoied skin cells and waiting for them to reaact
00:18:06 <fleeky> waiting to react to what? 
00:18:07 <dmiles> their connection to like cells cause them to tighten orlosen
00:18:18 <fleeky> oh
00:18:32 <fleeky> thats weird
00:18:34 <fleeky> never heard of that
00:19:02 <dmiles> by putting an array of cells on a electronic sensor you can id poeople
00:19:24 <dmiles> i'll find the web link
00:19:25 <fleeky> heh 
00:19:33 <dmiles> the army is workingon that
00:22:28 <dmiles> this one is unrelated ..but partuially on the same lines: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/baa01-42mod3.htm
00:26:27 * dmiles is looking for the exact biosignature grant
00:28:12 <dmiles> anyways i have to putter off for a bit
00:28:31 <dmiles> good seeing you in here
00:28:48 <dmiles> i think i found a really good longterm gamming protocol and system
00:29:21 <fleeky> which one?
00:29:22 <dmiles> its been used extensively by navy for game simulators
00:29:28 <dmiles> one sec
00:30:14 <dmiles> http://web3d.org/fs_pressreleases.htm
00:30:19 <fleeky> it would be neat if you could get it so opencyc could connect to all game protocols
00:30:25 <fleeky> web3d??
00:30:25 <dmiles> http://www.web3d.org/x3d/
00:30:30 <dmiles> X3D
00:30:57 <dmiles> well ther eis a ton of editors and clients out
00:31:10 <dmiles> its a form of VRML that is peer to peer
00:31:18 <dmiles> well only partially vrml
00:31:27 <fleeky> isnt it proprietary
00:31:38 <dmiles> its govt.. so its free and open 
00:32:43 <dmiles> hrrm funny it was started in 1991
00:32:58 <dmiles> but 3dlabs in 199 pushed it into a consortium
00:33:09 <dmiles> err 1999
00:33:30 <dmiles> oh in 2001
00:33:48 <dmiles> i tried out on of the players..
00:33:54 <dmiles> letme get you a link
00:35:56 <dmiles> http://www.web3d.org/TaskGroups/x3d/X3dIndex.html <- it's also pretty much all opensource software
00:36:10 <dmiles> still looking fora link to thgat ;P
00:37:28 <dmiles> what do you think of it?
00:37:51 <dmiles> they have GNU versions of it even
00:42:20 <fleeky> its nice .. i still gotta say that i think video game engines are the best way to go since they have to deal with pushing hardware limits. and bandwith limits
00:43:48 <dmiles> i realy wish theSims was opensource
00:43:53 <fleeky> hehe
00:44:22 <fleeky> if you made something like the sims i think it would definately be popular, not many people make that type of game 
00:44:26 <fleeky> or simulation .. 
00:44:28 <dmiles> there is one opensource prject called freethesims.. but they have mno code yet
00:48:15 <fleeky> and now for something completely different,  http://www.craigslist.org/sfo/eby/mis/6141173.html

18:52:53 <Loplin> someone is awake
18:52:56 <Loplin> :)
18:52:59 <fleeky> hehe sorta
18:53:02 <fleeky> trying to rewake up
18:53:07 * fleeky huggles coffee
18:53:40 <Loplin> so.. what kind of projects are people working on with cyc right now?
18:53:46 <fleeky> me none
18:53:49 <fleeky> im just a 3d modeller
18:53:53 <fleeky> highly interested in ai though
18:55:37 <Loplin> yeah
18:55:50 <Loplin> what kind of projects are otehr people working on?
18:55:54 <Loplin> other*
18:57:06 <Loplin> hm
19:00:02 <Loplin> well
19:00:37 <Loplin> do you know what the best documentation to read would be if i wanted to start developing?
19:01:03 <fleeky> not really , best i can do to help you is opencyc.org
19:01:21 <Loplin> k
19:03:56 <Cobwa> tutorial on opencyc.org isn't bad
19:04:11 <Loplin> okay
19:04:19 <Loplin> well, i dont have time to read that today
19:04:29 <Loplin> probobly friday night
19:04:42 <Loplin> but i have to go now
19:04:43 <Cobwa> Yeah.  You'll probably want to setup a system to walk through it with 
19:04:54 <Cobwa> helps retain the info :)
19:04:57 <Cobwa> see ya
19:05:01 <Loplin> okay
19:05:04 <Loplin> see ya later
19:05:06 <Cobwa> got to go myself
19:05:10 --- quit: Cobwa ("[x]chat")
19:05:12 <Loplin> thanks for answering my questions people
