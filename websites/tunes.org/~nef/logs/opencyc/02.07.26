09:33:17 <huthut> "Cyc enhances [...] by providing a powerful universal semantics"   Plain wrong; its semantics are not universal.
09:35:34 <dmiles> "by providing a powerful universal semantics" :) ? i would say attempts to provide knowledge formed in the most universal context.. each Mt is supposed to be consitent with the BaseKB
09:36:09 <huthut> Since e.g. human, as an inference engine, can frequently accept the sentence `I am both dead and alive.', and Cyc is not able to accept it, without additional tools.
09:36:45 <huthut> dmile, "Cyc enhances... by providing..." was a quote from opencyc faq.
09:36:51 <huthut> http://www.opencyc.org/OpenCyc_org/faq/faq1_html
09:36:55 <dmiles> right that takes an infernce to invalidate that statement.. it cannont invaluidate that unless it really knows better
09:37:06 --- quit: Vutral (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
09:38:08 <dmiles> i kinda looked at that it seems more a 'vission and scope document'
09:38:21 <dmiles> (then a FAQ :P)
09:39:21 <dmiles> What can one use OpenCyc to do?  <dones nne of those yet>
09:39:30 <dmiles> err none
09:39:52 <huthut> well the above quote means that this document contains gross (though, maybe, intentional) mistakes.
09:40:33 <huthut> (i mean a quote about universal semantics)
09:40:52 <dmiles> i would definately not deny that :P
09:41:21 <huthut> well, BaseKB does not represent any universal context
09:41:39 <dmiles> yeah its kinda of condition of use of 'names'
09:41:40 <huthut> alternatively, this `universe'  is very limited
09:42:13 <dmiles> BaseKB is supposed to enforce how common cyc terms could be under the same context of use 
09:42:33 <dmiles> like Collection/isa
09:43:11 <dmiles> and actually any extra hacks you think should propogate to the rest of the KB
09:43:48 <huthut> hacks you think?
09:43:54 <huthut> `hacks you think' ?
09:44:04 <dmiles> well an example is...
09:45:10 <dmiles> for example.. lets say the client is talking about the cooking alot 
09:45:30 <dmiles> in fact all the Mts they gave you invoved baking and cooking
09:46:10 <dmiles> you know that their is a certain undertnding of transformation process of food
09:46:34 <dmiles> well there is a transformational thing in BaseKB
09:46:49 <dmiles> but its not always appied to food in a quick enopugh dedcuction
09:47:10 <dmiles> imagine it take 4 backchains to reach a conclusion you like
09:47:33 <dmiles> you dont mind backcahining that far if you know what your after
09:47:52 <dmiles> but all the other conclussions that come will be explossive to your search space
09:47:57 <huthut> well, the ordinary language word `transformation' is synonymous to the cyc constant you speak about, if i understand right.
09:48:14 <huthut> constant of transf.. thing
09:48:15 <dmiles> yeah TranformationEvent or something like that
09:48:28 <huthut> uhh event
09:48:31 <huthut> not just event
09:48:42 <huthut> it can be a set of events
09:48:43 <dmiles> where uncooked browies can become cooked brownies
09:48:48 <dmiles> right 
09:49:08 <dmiles> maybe the set of events are too much detail
09:49:14 <huthut> set of events is sometimes not event
09:49:32 <huthut> ok
09:49:45 <dmiles> yeah ... in this might contain many subcases that work each way
09:50:14 <dmiles> and just deemed to exensive deduction to say that cooking will transform food
09:50:39 <dmiles> err to only guess... so BaseKB gets told something overly specifically
09:51:01 <dmiles> that works for like 8 microtheories at once
09:51:14 <dmiles> but rather pointless to the other 300 Mts
09:51:20 <huthut> overly specifically == gets in too many details?
09:51:43 <dmiles> and when 301 gets written that food thing may actually be a confliction
09:52:06 <huthut> so, where's the hack you were talking about?
09:52:18 <dmiles> well over specific is from using  terms defined to ber used generally in a usecase manner
09:53:00 <dmiles> the hack is oputting information in BaseKB that belongsed in its own package
09:53:12 <dmiles> out  ofthe way of the rest  ofthe system
09:53:38 <dmiles> and was put their to make some customer funder at the time app work
09:54:12 <dmiles> the customer supplied their 8 Mts
09:54:39 <dmiles> and there was no way of really doing it correct.. cuz the customers 8 could/should have been 100 Mts
09:55:14 <dmiles> so BaseKB gets hacked to make everything fit together
09:55:35 <dmiles> but really it only worked consistently for those 8 mts
09:55:58 <huthut> ok....  
09:56:10 <dmiles> what the proper proceedure would have been...
09:56:25 <dmiles> make one CustomerVOcabularyMt
09:56:36 <dmiles> and genlMt that to BaseKB
09:56:58 <dmiles> then only mess with CustomerVocabularyMt
09:57:35 <dmiles> most cases that is done...  the customer will supply a set of test questions..
09:57:53 <dmiles> exqmple quires they expect cyc to answer
09:58:31 <dmiles> when cyc fails one.. it is possible to trace down why.. and relaize some part or step was deemed to expensive to take
09:58:42 <dmiles> err too expensive
09:59:00 <huthut> may i ask you one question -- did you see any references to the reading about contraditory theories in mathematical formal logic, and in related areas ?
09:59:07 <dmiles> so i call this a 'hack' asserting the missing fact
10:00:07 <dmiles> i know it's important for cyccorp to provide limnkages buit maybe havent
10:00:37 <dmiles> thats a problem with cyc docs i think
10:01:09 <dmiles> we kinda need refernces to the types of logic they use
10:01:28 <huthut> i dont think they use contradictory theories :)
10:01:46 <dmiles> they say they do.. in exampkles of pegasis the unicorn
10:01:59 <dmiles> and exceptThen
10:02:08 <dmiles> err let me find the claim in the KB
10:02:45 <huthut> ahh if they speak about pegasus, then they do that i think.
10:03:43 <dmiles> under or bnear FictionalContext
10:04:01 <dmiles> comment :  "The collection of CounterfactualContexts which are (1) created intentionally, not by error or chance or gradual evolution and accretion in a culture, and (2) typically are the information content of some InformationBearingThing, and (3) are not expected (by their creator) to be believed as factual, nor do their creators believe them to be factual. In addition to asserting fictional propositions about existing things, a Fictional
10:05:39 <huthut> heheheh Counterfactual :)
10:06:46 <dmiles> disjointWith :  NonfictionalContext  
10:06:46 <dmiles> comment :  "The collection of microtheories that are each assumed to include at least one counterfactual assertion: an assertion which is believed to be untrue in the real world. It may be, however, that there is no explicit counterfactual assertion in a given CounterfactualContext.  
10:07:38 <huthut> (i mostly interested about such "counterfactual" stuff, which is in fact factual :) )
10:13:03 <dmiles> yeah Cyc knowledge can contain it
10:13:13 <dmiles> i mean handle such cases
10:13:24 <dmiles> i dont know if infernce has been implem,n ted yet to use it
10:15:04 <huthut> well - "Cyc knowledge can contain it"  --- i had similar thoughts several months ago... i didn't think about cyc, was just thinking about formal math logic, and tried to formalize `clap of single hand' etc
10:15:07 <huthut> was trying
10:15:53 <huthut> and tried to put these formalization into the same context as physics, math, reallife knowledge and so on.
10:16:03 <huthut> was trying
10:16:08 <dmiles> ah yeah.. it comes done to how consistantly can we formalize anything
10:16:08 <huthut> +s
10:38:29 <dmiles> i would say their are many things formal mathmatical logic has not specifally covered in a representation/implimentation things maybe it takes a KB like Cyc to say or annotate

11:41:09 <huthut> how can i see all or some elements for a given collection?
11:41:27 <huthut> i a kb browser
11:41:29 <huthut> in
11:43:31 <dmiles> you can do a...
11:44:28 <dmiles> for exammple.. to see instances  of Microthery
11:44:57 <dmiles> first get that page with Collection : Microtheory
11:45:07 <dmiles> into the right frame
11:45:22 <dmiles> now in the left frame..
11:45:43 <dmiles> got Arg2 isa and click the green plus sign
11:45:53 <dmiles> s/got/go to
11:46:17 <dmiles> you will get a page that says "Literal Query"
11:46:48 <dmiles> Last query in BaseKB :
11:46:48 <dmiles> (isa ?ARG1 Microtheory)
11:46:48 <dmiles> Query halted because : Query halted because : Search space was exhausted up to the depth cutoff.
11:46:48 <dmiles> 238 answers for ?ARG1 :
11:47:34 <huthut> thank yout
11:47:36 <huthut> -t
11:47:45 <dmiles> it worked?
11:48:30 <dmiles> you can also just click the 'isa' link but you wont get all of them
11:48:52 <dmiles> the green Plus makes it try to get all based off infernce
11:49:14 <huthut> no i didnt try yet
