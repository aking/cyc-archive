03:08:57 <Yepster> Steve are you there?
03:10:33 <Yepster> I've defined something as isa collectiontype. Now if I define something else as
03:11:07 <Yepster> isa something, then it isn't recognized as a collection. Should I make the 
03:11:15 <Yepster> isa something collection explicit?
03:11:42 <dmiles> well the intial ccollection must be specific
03:11:51 <dmiles> as asserted being so first
03:12:10 <Yepster> ?
03:12:12 <dmiles> then the instances of it are not required to be defined except by collection
03:13:00 <dmiles> what proceedure are you doing.. maybe its the order.. or the Mt scope
03:13:28 <dmiles> not all collections are vissible to all Mts
03:13:40 <dmiles> oh yeah.. that problem
03:13:45 <dmiles> CollectionType
03:13:47 <Yepster> I define everything in the same mt
03:14:02 <dmiles> i made a forward chaining rule to get arround it ;P
03:14:33 <Yepster> implies isa ?x collectiontype isa ?x collection?
03:14:42 <dmiles> (implies (isa ?X colletiontype) (implies ?X collectionm))
03:14:49 <dmiles> err yes
03:14:58 <dmiles> (implies (isa ?X colletiontype) (isa ?X collection))
03:15:04 <Yepster> thanks
03:15:23 <dmiles> another thing is a SecondOrderCollection
03:15:36 <dmiles> thats another way of say CollectionType often
03:16:15 <dmiles> a secondorder collection is a collection of firstordercollections
03:16:46 <Yepster> Does secondordercollection identify it's instances as collections correct?
03:17:01 <dmiles> yes
03:17:07 <Yepster> ah :_)
03:17:15 <dmiles> but i dont know if it will pass TMS problems tyou ran intio
03:17:53 <Yepster> I'll try it. Made an oracle sql scripts that does all assertions
03:17:55 <dmiles> i ussualy assert gafs w./o wff checks 
03:18:22 <dmiles> for non debufg runs you may want to turn TMS off by default
03:19:04 <Yepster> well my mt isn't really big.
03:19:22 <dmiles> (without-wff-semantics .. ) is the wrapper
03:21:49 <Yepster> hmm all instances of firstordercollections are individuals. ok.
03:22:59 <dmiles> yes.. so its more specific then CollectionType
03:23:10 <dmiles> (the Se4condOrderCollection)
03:24:07 <dmiles> becasue you know it defines co,lections holding indiviguals
04:07:57 <Yepster> hmm did you get that dcc thing?
04:09:19 <dmiles> no it never notified me ;(
04:09:43 <dmiles> hrrm sinc ei am on dialup all the things that used tio work dont
04:09:57 <dmiles> let me see if mirc has it set on ignore
04:10:44 <dmiles> ok i set it to autoacdwept download

05:20:45 <stevereed_home> do not confuse TMS with the WF-checker
05:21:19 <stevereed_home> TMS is the Truth Maintenance System with retracts all derived facts when a sole supporting fact is retracted.
05:21:41 <stevereed_home> It is somewhat similar to referential integrity in a database.
05:22:55 <stevereed_home> the WF-checker which is controlled by (without-wff-semantics ... checks each assertion for well-formedness, according to definitial assertions for each of embedded predicates, functions and collections.
05:23:45 <Yepster> This is cool stuff for my 'opencyc for oraclists' tutorial!
05:23:57 <Yepster> on delete cascade ~= TMS

09:03:17 <Yepster> found it; last assertion was not well formed because of arggenls violation.

23:52:50 <meds> anyone awake here?
23:54:28 <Edison> me
23:54:30 <Edison> hello!
23:54:44 <meds> hi edison
23:54:45 <meds> how you doing?
23:54:50 <Edison> fine, thx. 
23:55:01 <meds> are you involved with opencyc?
23:55:07 <Edison> I'm not involved in opencyc, so i'm a guest here. 
23:55:16 <meds> how much do you know about it?
23:55:58 <Edison> not much. I'm member of OpenAI and both projects are in the same foundry. So i'm listening to this channel.
23:56:12 <meds> but you know about AI i assume?
23:56:19 <meds> i had a few questions
23:57:03 <Edison> hmm. Shoot. But i'm more like a framework architect. I don't deal with actual AI components.
23:57:28 <meds> well i just heard about how cyc has come along and i got excited
23:57:32 <meds> right now i'm a medical student
23:57:42 <meds> I was thinking about taking a year off maybe
23:57:48 <meds> and starting a project
23:57:54 <meds> where you can type in a patients history
23:58:06 <meds> and have cyc come up with a differencial diagnosis
23:58:17 <meds> but i don't know anything about AI
23:58:22 <meds> i'm good with computers
23:58:32 <meds> so i wanted to know how feasable that would be
23:58:34 <Edison> heh. This would be a _very_ tough one.
23:59:10 <meds> tough project?
23:59:16 <meds> tought question to answer?
23:59:48 <Edison> I dont know much about medics. But i think its more than 'hurt A' + 'illness B' = 'illness C in 5 years'
23:59:58 <meds> yes!
