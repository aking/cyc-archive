00:55:42 <theos> dmiles: hi there
01:31:05 <dmiles> hi
01:31:20 <dmiles> things are good
01:31:21 <theos> here you are, must be late...
01:31:52 <dmiles> cable tv. came with my modem,
01:32:17 <dmiles> so it messes up my sleeping schedule.. i naver had tv/cable before
01:32:29 <theos> I don't have a tv here :)
01:32:46 <dmiles> i cant stop watching it sometimes
01:32:55 <theos> I think I will involve myself into opencyc
01:32:58 <dmiles> especially good time i could be coding
01:33:13 <dmiles> execeelnt
01:33:31 <theos> hmm, I am not sure :)
01:33:41 <dmiles> well its a great engine
01:33:59 <theos> hopefullyit can support what I want to realize
01:34:10 <dmiles> i have been messing with the ui for couple weeks
01:34:17 <theos> do you think it might be usefull to speech enable the interaction?
01:34:21 <dmiles> just gettijg used to the java api
01:34:29 * theos not a programmer
01:34:42 <dmiles> i think it could tell you where the conversation is going better then anything else
01:34:45 * theos has 4 programmers :)
01:35:08 <dmiles> so if you wanted to make sure your text-to-thinking is correct and makes sense
01:35:12 <dmiles> oipencyc can do that
01:35:23 <theos> well
01:35:28 <dmiles> opencyc can help pick the rifght domain to parse iover
01:35:34 <dmiles> err parse over
01:35:43 <theos> you remember the thesis I want to do?
01:35:53 <dmiles> slightly .. refresh me though
01:36:07 <theos> context awareness without artificial sensors
01:36:24 <dmiles> right the "artificial sensors" vs ?
01:36:28 <theos> I know there is a lot going on in the field of tagging everything with passive beacons and so on
01:36:53 <theos> versus dialog based man machine team, whereas the human is the sensor :)
01:37:05 <theos> just the protocol between the machine is a bit sloppy right now, hehe
01:37:35 <dmiles> ah yes, that falls into the area of that cyc is very interested in i bet, expert to expert-system 
01:37:52 <dmiles> meaning normally you have the field agent
01:37:59 <dmiles> then an field expert
01:38:10 <dmiles> a knowledge engineer
01:38:43 <dmiles> the knowledge engieer makes sure the field experts knowledge is understanble to the system
01:39:21 <dmiles> too many people to coordinate
01:39:43 <dmiles> the chain is slow as the weakest
01:39:49 <theos> too many people to coordinate ?
01:39:58 <theos> what do you mean by that, in a one2one system?
01:40:01 <dmiles> there are better possiblities
01:40:19 <dmiles> yes.. maybe agent to machine back to agnet
01:40:42 <dmiles> well not that thats always possible
01:40:48 <theos> you thing human->agent->machine
01:40:50 <theos> ?
01:41:06 <dmiles> foir example.. you have a 2 star general who cant operate a computer yet..
01:41:21 <dmiles> he haas to deal with a technitian ior knowledge engineeer
01:41:29 <theos> wait
01:41:40 <theos> not that we talk about different things
01:41:45 <theos> suppose
01:41:56 <theos> I want to visit you, and am already in town
01:42:14 <theos> I phone you up, asking for the way.
01:42:39 <theos> You tell me where to go, after locating me via a dialog.
01:42:57 <theos> I want to replace the phone connection and you :)
01:43:04 <theos> generally spoken
01:43:38 <dmiles> well yeah there shoiukd be one master inteligence that could handle talking tio you and i
01:43:42 <dmiles> the dialog system in cyc is getting alot of attention
01:44:35 <dmiles> that intigence should be able to ask me for you and rely the information you wanrt.. perhaps driving dirrections.. even though i just gave it an adress
01:45:01 <dmiles> so understanding the amount of detail each person wants (you or me) is important
01:45:08 <theos> hmm
01:45:17 <dmiles> i am on the detail of adress it can just ask me that
01:45:29 <dmiles> but for you actually know your new in town and need dirrections
01:45:35 <theos> that implies that you are still part of this scenariuon, what about replacing you yourself with a artificial solution?
01:46:00 <dmiles> well if the phone book would supply the same info then the inteligence shoulf get it there
01:46:21 <dmiles> and only send me a short message your comming already
01:46:47 <theos> so, in the end
01:46:47 <dmiles> i would go.. hrrm how di he know where i live?
01:46:57 <dmiles> damn computers!
01:47:10 --- quit: stevereed_home (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
01:47:38 <theos> I want to talk to the machine, saying: " I am at this x and want to go to dmiles(or place y)"
01:47:42 --- join: stevereed_home (~reed@adsl-66-141-46-249.dsl.austtx.swbell.net) joined #opencyc
01:47:49 <theos> assuming that the machine has some kind of terrain understanding
01:48:30 <theos> so there are two parts to solve
01:48:42 <theos> whereas I will concentrate on one of them only
01:48:54 <theos> 1. "i am at place x"
01:48:58 <dmiles> (bestVehicalPath (locationOf theo) (locationOf dmiles) ?TRANSPORT ?PATH )
01:49:08 <theos> right something like that
01:50:04 <theos> now, I just have to make sure my description of place x (landmark recognition) is understandable by the machine
01:50:13 <theos> and that should give me enough to think about
01:50:32 <dmiles> you need a Everything to CycL converter
01:50:50 <dmiles> starting the Anything to CycL :P
01:51:01 <theos> lol
01:51:29 <theos> well, one could start with a limited domain, eg. a building, or town
01:51:33 <dmiles> Microsoft has a english tio CycL converter
01:51:48 <dmiles> but it only runs on widows
01:51:53 <dmiles> err windows
01:51:54 * theos starts to feel unpleasant :)

01:53:37 <theos> ha!
01:53:38 <theos> great
01:53:52 <theos> what thingie runs there in the backroung?
01:54:00 <dmiles> +F0 was a unkown variable
01:54:20 <dmiles> i have to finish a wrapper fo rit
01:54:34 <dmiles> and then convert the LF to CycL still.. easy

01:56:45 <dmiles> right we talked about a NDA before>?
01:57:02 <dmiles> i was trying to remember the exact person 
01:57:28 <dmiles> right my email was jammed at the time i think
01:57:35 <dmiles> mailbox was full
01:57:39 <theos> aha
01:57:44 <theos> how do we go about it
01:57:53 <dmiles> dmiles@users.sourceforge.net now
01:58:07 <dmiles> i have a paid email now
01:58:15 <dmiles> so i dont have limits
01:58:24 <theos> dmiles, want an ulimited one, without paying
01:58:48 <theos> like dmiles@augmented.org or v2w.de or .com or whatever?
01:58:59 <theos> takes me about 1 minute
01:59:02 <dmiles> yrrm sounds very good
01:59:25 <theos> a second, 
01:59:34 <theos> i pull up configuration interface...
02:00:37 <dmiles> v2w.com ?
02:01:07 <theos> nah, just .de
02:01:09 <theos> but
02:01:11 <theos> you can have
02:01:16 <theos> augmented.org
02:01:23 <theos> isotheos.com
02:01:26 <theos> v2w.de
02:01:47 <dmiles> ok :)
02:01:51 <theos> all of them?
02:02:15 <dmiles> i cant decide ;<
02:02:29 <theos> well, choose your poison
02:02:35 <theos> the session expires soon :)
02:03:01 <dmiles> i like isotheos.com
02:03:06 <theos> me too
02:03:07 <dmiles> god of standards
02:03:18 <theos> old greek for goodlike
02:03:20 <theos> hehe
02:03:43 <theos> k, then I make it dmiles@isotheos.com ?
02:03:46 <dmiles> international standards org gods
02:04:02 <dmiles> yeah i do like
02:04:07 <theos> a second,
02:04:10 <theos> plz
02:04:17 <dmiles> even though i like the augmented.org website
02:04:20 <dmiles> ok :)
02:11:56 <theos> everything done
02:12:22 <dmiles> excelent
02:13:03 <theos> it may take up to 3 hours until it is activated
02:13:07 <theos> meanwhile,
02:13:08 <dmiles> have the confirmation
02:13:15 <theos> good
02:13:22 <theos> makes sense to you?
02:13:36 <dmiles> yes
02:13:38 <theos> good
