05:13:27 <theos_wrk> anybody alive?
05:13:31 <theos_wrk> read the logs
05:13:38 <theos_wrk> I got ressources to contribute to opencyc
05:13:44 <theos_wrk> who is responsible for this?
06:39:41 --- join: stevereed (reed@207.207.8.185) joined #opencyc
06:39:52 <theos_wrk> stevereed: hi there
06:39:54 <theos_wrk> got a minute?
06:40:01 <stevereed> sure
06:40:12 <theos_wrk> maybe you read the logs
06:40:14 <theos_wrk> but anyway
06:40:16 <stevereed> yes
06:40:19 <theos_wrk> ahh
06:40:32 <stevereed> I forwarded your,
06:40:38 <theos_wrk> I got a student here for six weeks and I want to contribute to opencyc
06:40:40 <stevereed> speech interface request
06:40:45 <theos_wrk> ahh
06:40:46 <theos_wrk> great
06:40:47 <stevereed> to our dialog group,
06:40:55 <stevereed> and have not yet got a response.
06:41:10 <stevereed> I will follow up today.
06:41:14 <theos_wrk> I intend to dedicate my PhD to this area
06:41:20 <theos_wrk> so there are more ressources to come
06:41:32 <theos_wrk> I got a team of 5-8 ppl to get involved
06:41:36 <stevereed> what speech engine would you use.
06:41:41 <theos_wrk> well
06:41:52 <theos_wrk> not sure yet, got to be free software
06:41:57 <stevereed> sphinx?
06:42:02 <theos_wrk> which limits the options
06:42:10 <theos_wrk> sphinx is ok, Kevin Lenzo is good friend of mine
06:42:29 <theos_wrk> so is Alan W. Black for the synthesis part (festival/flight)
06:42:36 <stevereed> ok.
06:42:48 <stevereed> the synthesis part is somewhat easier,
06:42:59 <theos_wrk> hmm, do you think so
06:43:01 <stevereed> in that Cyc does English paraphrase already.
06:43:10 <theos_wrk> getting a proper prosody is not that easy
06:43:23 <stevereed> the word disambiguation is harder for us.
06:43:32 <stevereed> during recognition.
06:43:36 <theos_wrk> ic
06:43:48 <stevereed> but in a domain,
06:43:54 <stevereed> in a constrained context.
06:44:02 <stevereed> we can help disambiguate words
06:44:08 <stevereed> from the sphinx word list.
06:44:12 <theos_wrk> eg. domain scheduling
06:44:17 <stevereed> based upon context.
06:44:46 <stevereed> the six weeks is not long enough to
06:44:59 <stevereed> make a robust connection between cyc and speech engines.
06:45:07 <theos_wrk> well
06:45:19 <theos_wrk> actually the person will be here 8 weeks, but that is not suffiecient also
06:45:21 <theos_wrk> but
06:45:25 <stevereed> but examples could be worked out.
06:45:44 <theos_wrk> as I said, I will dedicate my PhD to it so we have loads more power
06:46:09 <stevereed> I can get you access to ResearchCyc, when that comes out.
06:46:23 <theos_wrk> interesting...
06:46:24 <theos_wrk> btw
06:46:24 <stevereed> OpenCyc has 100K axioms,
06:46:34 <theos_wrk> I will meet dmiles 3rd of June in Seattle
06:46:37 <theos_wrk> are you around?
06:46:37 <stevereed> ResearchCyc will have about 300K axioms.
06:46:45 <theos_wrk> ha
06:46:46 <theos_wrk> great
06:47:06 <stevereed> no but I'll be in Edmonton for the aaai 2002 conference in July.
06:47:19 <theos_wrk> Edmonton is exactly where?
06:47:27 <stevereed> The great white north.
06:47:33 <theos_wrk> north of?
06:47:39 <stevereed> Canada
06:47:41 <theos_wrk> aha
06:47:55 <stevereed> actually above Denver and Calgary.
06:47:55 <theos_wrk> maybe I can come, well see
06:48:14 <stevereed> doug miles knows the cyc api fairly well.
06:48:38 <stevereed> if the glue code between cyc and the speech engines is java that would be easier.
06:48:49 <stevereed> but not a requirement.
06:49:08 <stevereed> in the longer term we will support python, C and other language bindings.
06:49:10 <theos_wrk> I think so too, I think sphinx is capable of being interfaced by java
06:49:18 <stevereed> ok
06:49:32 <theos_wrk> althouhg I am not that into opencyc as of yet, but that'll change
06:49:39 <stevereed> in six weeks,
06:49:47 <theos_wrk> what about parsing "near-natural" language
06:49:59 <stevereed> we have a good template parser.
06:50:06 <stevereed> for controlled vocabularies.
06:50:15 <stevereed> you can modify it via the kb.
06:50:24 <theos_wrk> ic
06:50:26 <stevereed> the templates are reified (named) in the kb.
06:50:45 <stevereed> we do better with clarification dialog.
06:51:00 <stevereed> for example:
06:51:10 <stevereed> "My chips are hot!"
06:51:25 <stevereed> cyc: do you mean potatoe chips or computer chips?
06:51:36 <stevereed> and so on.
06:51:45 <theos_wrk> understood
06:51:54 <stevereed> this will come out with release 1.0.
06:51:57 <stevereed> in july.
06:52:03 <theos_wrk> great
06:52:11 <stevereed> as part of the Rapid Knowledge Formation toolkit.
06:52:14 <theos_wrk> this is when I will start seriously
06:52:26 <stevereed> we have several computational linguists on our staff.
06:52:39 <stevereed> maybe six altogether.
06:52:56 <stevereed> who can provide some technical assistance.
06:52:59 <theos_wrk> there have been tons of PhDs about NLP and they are not that advanced I'd say
06:53:10 <stevereed> small steps.
06:53:21 <stevereed> in the right direction.
06:53:21 <theos_wrk> april issue of Computer (IEEE) is on speech recognition and dialog based systems
06:53:22 <theos_wrk> read that?
06:53:28 <stevereed> not yet.
06:53:37 <stevereed> I wonder if its online?
06:53:45 <theos_wrk> lemme check
06:53:54 <theos_wrk> "Automated Natural Spoken Dialo"
06:53:56 <theos_wrk> +g
06:54:09 <theos_wrk> have you got an account?
06:54:29 <stevereed> not for IEEE, but can i get them one-off?
06:54:41 <theos_wrk> well i have, I am checking just now
06:55:58 <theos_wrk> it is online
06:56:04 <theos_wrk> http://www.computer.org/computer/co2002/r4toc.htm
06:56:15 <theos_wrk> shall I sent you the article
06:56:57 <stevereed> reed@cyc.com
06:57:04 <theos_wrk> a second
06:58:27 <theos_wrk> want more?
06:58:32 <theos_wrk> of them?
06:59:40 <stevereed> all if possible.
06:59:50 <theos_wrk> downloading
07:01:55 <stevereed> OK i see that I can buy them so no problem - i'll get them myself.
07:05:17 <theos_wrk> on their way :)
07:06:41 <theos_wrk> should be there
07:09:52 <stevereed> mail server slow here
07:10:11 --- join: theos_ (~torsten@port-212-202-179-62.reverse.qdsl-home.de) joined #opencyc
07:11:32 <theos_wrk> well
07:11:36 <theos_wrk> it'll get there
07:11:58 <stevereed> ok thanks.
07:12:09 <theos_wrk> back to the ressource contribution
07:12:14 <stevereed> ok.
07:12:20 <theos_wrk> do you think you get response in the next few hours?
07:12:26 <stevereed> yes.
07:12:35 <stevereed> by noon central time.
07:12:42 <stevereed> I've already started.
07:13:50 --- quit: theos (Read error: 113 (No route to host))
07:13:56 <theos_wrk> hmm central time is UTC-6?
07:14:54 <theos_wrk> or your time is now?
07:18:19 <stevereed> 9:17am
07:19:12 <theos_wrk> here it is 16:19
07:19:25 <theos_wrk> so I will be up and listening at the time you get response :)
07:19:42 <stevereed> I will email you too.
07:19:46 <theos_wrk> any relations to openai from opencyc?
07:19:55 <stevereed> none formal.
07:20:12 <stevereed> we have interested developers in common.
07:20:25 <theos_wrk> aha, not synergies to expect?
07:20:42 <stevereed> I would be happy if someone contributed an interface to the openai framework.
07:20:50 <theos_wrk> aha
07:20:58 <theos_wrk> 6-8 weeks :)
07:21:01 <stevereed> but there are many other ai projects at sourceforge for synergies.
07:22:00 <stevereed> i'll look at openai again. I believe they are java.
07:22:13 <theos_wrk> lets say I want to build a dialog based system not necessarirly with speech interaction for a limited domain (eg scheduling)
07:22:22 <theos_wrk> how small can it get (for embedding...)

18:27:38 <dmiles> hi Steve
18:27:47 <dmiles> ltns ;) .. i have been real busy

19:06:24 <dmiles> ok i worked my highney off intergrating jamud and cyc
19:06:39 <dmiles> but now i see alot of work was not nessisary
19:07:03 <dmiles> hehe.. i am trying a new approabch and probly the easiest!
19:07:42 <dmiles> i am going to start with the telnet server as just a pretty wrapped cyc client
19:08:06 <dmiles> that has Mud methods.. probly anyone understanding logicvmoo thought thats all it would be
19:08:23 <dmiles> but i had this huge 50 java files attqacjhed
19:08:41 <dmiles> trying push-pull cyc object making
19:09:07 <dmiles> but that turns out to be almost donwe and overly nuts.. so i am going tonight try a simpler approach
19:09:36 <dmiles> so if CycLBot is up/down too much will not have him keep joining
19:09:55 <dmiles> then put him back in before i retire the nioght
