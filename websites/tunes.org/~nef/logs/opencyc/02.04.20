00:00:00 --- log: started opencyc/02.04.20
00:00:00 <johnd> The decision has to be made at some point
00:00:19 <johnd> And it will affect others who are relying on #$Game
00:00:28 <DougMiles> EntertainmentMt should be looking into EntertainmentSuggestedMts
00:00:53 <DougMiles> EntertainmentMt is aligned very carefull suggested not
00:01:28 <DougMiles> BobEntertainmentSuggestedMt 
00:02:04 <johnd> Say again?
00:02:22 <johnd> What's the reln between EntMt and BobsEntSuggMt
00:02:31 <DougMiles> what if EntertainmetnMt had its own version of #$Game already
00:02:48 <DougMiles> i'll asnwer your question first
00:03:44 <DougMiles>  the reln between EntMt and BobsEntSuggMt is that EntMt was designed to look at BobsEntSuggMt and other unofficial Mts
00:04:07 <johnd> does look at mean genlmt
00:04:23 <DougMiles> i think it would be a special genlMt
00:04:31 <DougMiles> yes in a way
00:04:49 <DougMiles> but instead of specialuizing a genlMt..
00:04:49 <johnd> we've been saying for a while we need the ability to have a filter on GenMt
00:04:59 <DougMiles> you specialize the unofficial Mts
00:05:23 <johnd> so the unofficial mts are specmts
00:05:37 <DougMiles> yes
00:05:40 <johnd> That's why we need MT filters
00:06:00 <johnd> to be able to override the meaning of #$Game
00:06:08 <johnd> without throwing out the whole Mt
00:06:11 <DougMiles> officaial Mts should be set up to look at its  unofficial mts in a defiernt way.. 
00:06:31 <johnd> how
00:06:36 <DougMiles> and official Mts should become offical only if merged and aligned with the rest of Cyc
00:07:15 <DougMiles> so there is always this upper one world way of looking at things (will to the best it can be)
00:07:45 <johnd> how looked at differently? less trusted? how does the knowledge combine?
00:08:02 <DougMiles> so the filter your refering to.. is like a way that the officialMt can lift from the unofficals
00:08:26 <DougMiles> yes.. less trust  but with boosted realivancy 
00:08:32 <johnd> no, other way around
00:08:47 <bruce> DougMiles: is this related to some of the stuff that you and I have discussed ?
00:09:17 <johnd> the unofficials can be used, but they can inherit almost everything from the officials
00:09:39 <DougMiles> bruce: it's about how people with many ideas of what things are would have to be able to come to a logical agreement and resolve their differences by expanding and finding out wahy they are differnt
00:10:01 <DougMiles> err finding out way and then specializing the why 
00:10:09 <DougMiles> err find out why
00:10:48 <DougMiles> johnd: so this starts from the query level?
00:11:09 <johnd> yes, at least the part I'm describing
00:11:11 <DougMiles> (meaning you pick your unofficials based on query)
00:11:17 <johnd> yes
00:11:29 <johnd> there's another angle on this
00:11:40 <bruce> DougMiles: ahh, okay.
00:11:58 <johnd> One of the inference programmers describes the overall problem this way...
00:12:11 <johnd> Well, this is a little different, but...
00:12:29 <johnd> Imagine you've got 2 people
00:12:40 <johnd> one is retiring after 20 years service
00:12:49 <johnd> one is a freshly minted MBA
00:13:11 <johnd> you want the MBA to end up having the knowledge of the both of them
00:13:22 <johnd> we call it the mind meld problem
00:13:38 <johnd> there has to be a conversation between the two KBs
00:13:41 <johnd> uh, people
00:13:51 <johnd> no, that's the point
00:13:58 <johnd> we're talking about KBs
00:14:12 <johnd> a little anthropomorphizing never hurt anyone
00:14:29 <johnd> they have to get to know each other
00:14:31 <johnd> top-down
00:14:43 <DougMiles> interesting.. an argument between the people/KBs then they learn what is differnt intil they find out someone defined a situation in better detail and there was no conflict other then nominclature
00:14:43 <johnd> do we agree on what #$Thing is?
00:14:54 <johnd> yes
00:15:06 <johnd> Sometimes there will be actual conflicts
00:15:24 <johnd> In that case, retain both in separate MTs
00:15:34 <johnd> use all knowledge that you can
00:15:41 <DougMiles> like 1 + 1 = 1 + dif
00:15:56 <DougMiles> err = 1 + dif + dif
00:15:58 <johnd> the core has to end up being fully consistent with the MBA
00:16:35 <DougMiles> so its then 1 + dif 
00:16:41 <DougMiles> 1 + exceptions
00:17:02 <johnd> because the MBA speaks the language of the current world (the latest build)
00:17:10 <johnd> yes
00:17:29 <johnd> you can mathropomorphize
00:17:41 <DougMiles> hrrm makes good sense.. how would you ever use the other separated out Mt ?
00:18:02 <DougMiles> the conflictiveMt
00:18:12 <johnd> a situation arises that the MBA didn't anticipate
00:18:34 <johnd> the MBA doesn't even have the right language for problems with the old diesel engines
00:18:38 <DougMiles> so when the extent of the MergedMt has been exasted.. it time to step up?
00:18:42 <DougMiles> (or down)
00:18:49 <johnd> must rely on the veterans knowledge
00:19:16 <DougMiles> would you have fully search the other first.. backchains/time/etc ?
00:19:27 <DougMiles> then start in on the other separtly?
00:19:36 <johnd> I think that's why it's AI Hard.
00:19:51 <DougMiles> (instead of lifting into the inferecePSC)
00:19:58 <johnd> In case I sound like I fully understand the solution, let me be clear that I don't.
00:20:21 <johnd> I'm pretty sure it has not been fully resolved.
00:20:37 <DougMiles> well the amny agetns voting system so far has been the way the problems in the past have resolved this
00:20:44 <johnd> Hopefully, partial solutions will get us most of the way there in the near term.
00:21:06 <DougMiles> yes
00:21:22 <johnd> I can't believe I'm still up.
00:21:32 <DougMiles> :) 1:25 ?
00:21:38 <johnd> I've got to go to bed.
00:21:43 <DougMiles> its friday night.. you are partying
00:21:43 <johnd> 2:25
00:22:09 <DougMiles> waking up with sore fingers the next morning
00:22:14 <johnd> Married with children. Yes, this is partying.
00:22:34 <johnd> Don't get to sleep until noon, unfortunately.
00:22:40 <DougMiles> :)
00:22:54 <DougMiles> well we have plenty more time to talk at another time
00:23:06 <johnd> Yes. See you later. Good luck with the bot.
00:23:22 <DougMiles> its fun talking about this prolem
00:23:22 <DougMiles> yes thanks for that ione query from the APi
00:23:23 --- quit: johnd ()
00:23:32 <DougMiles> i am just going to use the EveryThingPSC
00:23:43 <DougMiles> hey bruce.. i sent a post
00:23:50 <DougMiles> but i dont know if it made it
00:24:16 <DougMiles> it was a begining example.. of a RPG based ontolgy
00:24:30 <DougMiles> that people could knock arround and refine 
00:24:58 <DougMiles> lets see if i put it in CVS..
00:25:23 <bruce> it did make it
00:25:33 <DougMiles> ah ok good
00:25:34 <bruce> the moderator moderated tonight
00:26:17 <DougMiles> i dont know what state it was in when sent ;P
00:26:36 <bruce> it seems to have made it :)
00:26:36 <DougMiles> but anyways gives the idea of what an ontology could look like
00:26:50 <bruce> yeah, much like the usual object hierarchy .. which has various problems.
00:27:00 <bruce> I'll try to find the time to write up something this weekend.
00:27:04 <bruce> but must sleep for now.
00:27:12 <DougMiles> yes.. Collections in Cyc are to help denote attrivburtes
00:27:15 <DougMiles> ok cool
00:27:28 <DougMiles> g'night
00:28:34 <bruce> good night

14:01:36 <Don> You should probably hook up with Steve on this when he stops back in.
14:02:16 <Don> He tried to find out who created it by "ask: (myCreator ? CycLBot)"
14:02:40 <dmiles> yeah he would have some good ways to extend it i just made a default ask/assert/cyclify/sbul
14:03:14 <dmiles> ask: (isa CycLBot ?W)
14:03:14 <CycLBot> (((?W . IrcBot)))
14:03:27 <dmiles> yeah thats th eonly assertion rioght now ;P
14:04:16 <dmiles> it will me neat to learn how to argFormat and experment for NL type things
14:04:54 <dmiles> i am not ambitous when it comes to NL support (well at least what is done from Java)
14:05:42 <dmiles> but SubL based would be good
14:06:04 <dmiles> i am glad everyone likes it though
14:06:16 <Don> yeah pretty cool
14:06:47 <dmiles> i made an inference irc bot for another project.. it was written in prolog.. it does NL and a lot of tricks
14:07:07 <Don> that's something I have never played with
14:07:25 <dmiles> i am adding in the DCC agent line into this bot so those parts can telnet in and help cyclbot
14:07:58 <dmiles> so what happens is the englisgh first trys to fit into template basded parsing by cyc
14:08:27 <dmiles> well first.. it checks if the user has ientered an open or closed Cyc statermtm
14:08:45 <dmiles> if its an S-Expersion.. it trys to decide open/closed
14:08:55 <dmiles> that helps decide if it should be a query or not
14:09:11 <dmiles> if noit then goes into fitted cyc nl
14:09:25 <dmiles> if that fails it hits the MS parser
14:09:25 --- quit: stevereed_home (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))
14:09:42 <dmiles> then one the laguage is converted to CycL..
14:10:02 --- join: stevereed_home (~reed@adsl-66-141-46-249.dsl.austtx.swbell.net) joined #opencyc
14:10:37 <dmiles> basicly if all expert systems fail.. cyc nl, ms NL parser, irc commands, etc.. it finnaly falls into an eliza responder
14:10:59 <dmiles> so a statement is like a marbel.. that is rolllinbg down a slide with differnt holes
14:11:21 <Don> and it says "tell me more about your Cyc"?
14:12:01 <dmiles> right "tell ??who ?ammount ?indiviugul" wiould be a template
14:12:30 <dmiles> err "tell ??who ?ammount about ?indiviugul" 
14:12:47 <Don> right
14:13:35 <dmiles> MS wrote a parser much like how cyc was developed.. started with a gerneral system
14:13:53 <dmiles> then spend many developer years working with case use 
14:14:24 <dmiles> the resuklt is the MS parser is VERY powerfull at text to LogicalLanguage
14:15:09 <dmiles> i wont to spend about 5 hours one day figuring how to hook it into cyc 
14:15:33 <dmiles> just to see if there is a good fit together
14:16:11 <dmiles> probly not and not going to be supported and imporved the way cyc NL would be
14:16:29 <dmiles> i mean supported by MS in the future
14:16:45 <dmiles> MS = microsoft
14:17:51 <dmiles> the purpus of CycLbot is to give an extendable class and interfaces that can be cammond/controlled from irc
14:18:14 <dmiles> then that can be used by others that want to make complex chatter bots
14:18:56 <dmiles> its fun to have a default on in channel
14:20:10 <dmiles> i sat there for a few minutes wondering how painfull NL would be like in Java
14:20:24 <Don> I was surprised/pleased to see it
14:21:03 <dmiles> well i just found a very simple irc bot class on google  that knew how to connectexct and idle
14:21:18 <dmiles> but i had written irc bots before.. from C and Prolog
14:21:32 <dmiles> so i knew the acsii protocol
14:22:31 <dmiles> putserver: ACTION #opencyc : bounce
14:23:03 <dmiles> putserver: PRIVMSG #opencyc : Hello
14:23:30 <dmiles> putserv: PRIVMSG #opencyc : Hello
14:23:30 <CycLBot>  Hello
14:23:44 <dmiles> putserv: ACTION #opencyc : bounce
14:24:58 <dmiles> i am going to need help figuring out how to filter from the SubL interface commands that lets shell commands happen
14:25:10 <dmiles> since this bot runs as root
14:28:18 <Don> can't have that...
14:28:46 <dmiles> another thing is Steve has some awesome chatterbot classes in CVs..
14:28:55 <dmiles> i am going to figurte out how to make this bot use them
14:29:54 <dmiles> the first time you do something like communicate to an irc server it seems like it is going to be a can of worms...
14:30:16 <dmiles> so probly the only reason he hadnt done it already
14:31:02 <dmiles> but the classes to support what goes beyound the connection based classes are there in opencyc
14:33:55 <dmiles> i am going to use the ConsoleChat.java as a baseline and add it into the bot
14:34:56 --- quit: Seth ()

21:43:52 <johndcyc> time
21:43:53 <CycLBot> the time is Sat Apr 20 14:20:54 PDT 2002
21:43:59 <dmiles> well i set it 5 or lass.. but i think toCliclify< 80 is better test now
21:44:07 <dmiles> so itys actually one line and not broken
21:44:07 <johndcyc> That time is wrong, even in PDT, isn't it?
21:44:29 <dmiles> ioh tyhat right my clock is skewed
21:44:56 <dmiles> i was ussing some sharware ;P.. i should fix that 
21:44:58 <johndcyc> I think you're trying to shift the rest of the world to your schedule ;)
21:45:17 <dmiles> i set the year later buit not the itme
21:45:38 <dmiles> yeah i guess its like my 2:20- ;P
21:46:03 <dmiles> it 9:49 here
21:46:08 <johndcyc> right
21:46:16 <johndcyc> gotta go, 11:45 here
21:46:29 <johndcyc> I'm looking forward to playing with the bot tomorrow.
21:46:38 <dmiles> excellent
21:46:57 <johndcyc> Can you advertise it with a message on SourceForge OpenCyc forum, when you're ready
21:47:18 <johndcyc> When you think it's ready enough for some play
21:47:43 <johndcyc> you could build in a simple help, too. that would be cool
21:47:53 <johndcyc> CycLBot, how do you work?
21:48:04 <dmiles> yeah i'll do a help that lists its builtin commands
21:48:23 <johndcyc> Then, when Steve helps with some English templates...
21:48:38 <johndcyc> A list of templates that work could be displayed
21:48:46 <johndcyc> What do you know about ______
21:49:01 <johndcyc> What kind of thing is a ____________
21:49:10 <dmiles> yeah its hooked in to use steves template system.. i'll need hius help to confirm i have used it correctly
21:49:19 <johndcyc> What kinds of ______ are there
21:49:37 <johndcyc> Is ________ a __________
21:49:44 <johndcyc> Is _________ a kind of ____________
21:50:12 <johndcyc> And then templates (maybe the same ones?) for asserts
21:50:25 <johndcyc> CycLBot, JohnD is a Person
21:50:56 <dmiles> yeah.. is there two templates for most predicates.. like isa ?
21:51:08 <johndcyc> it depends
21:51:23 <dmiles> argFormat vs ______ ?
21:51:32 <johndcyc> If you're using the new genTemplate pred, it could probably work in both directions
21:52:58 <dmiles> i may just need to confirm i am ussing chatterbot classes right.. and it may be able to return a CycL with assert/query dispensation
21:53:28 <CycLBot> I am gone
21:53:42 <dmiles> it does that sometimes ;P
21:54:40 <johndcyc> (genTemplate isa (NPIsNP-NLSentenceFn (TermParaphraseFn :ARG1) (PhraseFormFn nonPlural-Generic (BestDetNbarFn-Indefinite (TermParaphraseFn :ARG2)))))
21:54:50 <johndcyc> That's meant for generation.
21:55:05 <dmiles> excelent
21:55:15 <dmiles> ARG1 ..
21:55:18 <johndcyc> But something could be done to turn it around, I think.
21:55:40 <johndcyc> Hasn't been used the other way (assert) yet, though, as far as I know.
21:55:42 <dmiles> is that a '(list of words) ?
21:56:00 <dmiles> oh that the ELFormula
21:56:35 <dmiles> id there a String on one end and a Formula on the other end preduicate?
21:56:57 <johndcyc> Here's the English paraphrase of the above: "One way to paraphrase a formula whose arg0 is #$isa is [:ARG1 is :ARG2].
21:57:55 <johndcyc> It's using TermParaphrase, whose comment says:
21:57:59 <johndcyc> "(TermParaphraseFn OBJ) denotes the (contextually dependent) natural-language paraphrase for OBJ. The exact identity of the phrase will depend upon such factors as the language of paraphrase, the lexical resources available to the paraphraser, the syntactic function of the phrase within a sentence, and pragmatic considerations such as the identity of the addressee and the reason for referring to OBJ at all." 
21:58:49 <dmiles> query:(equals (TermParaphraseFn (isa Fido Dog)) ?W)
21:58:50 <CycLBot> (((?W TermParaphraseFn (isa Fido Dog))))
21:58:50 <johndcyc> It's a little fancier than the old #$genFormat

21:59:49 <CycLBot> NIL
22:00:47 <dmiles> i still catching up with format predicates
22:01:00 <johndcyc> I think TermParaphraseFn operates on each arg
22:01:09 <johndcyc> not on a whole expression
22:01:18 <dmiles> could you give me an example of ussing it from Query or subl ?
