== Project Overview ==
The aim of the EU FP 7 Large-Scale Integrating Project LarKC is to develop the Large Knowledge Collider (LarKC, for short, pronounced "lark"), a platform for massive distributed incomplete reasoning that will remove the scalability barriers of currently existing reasoning systems for the Semantic Web. See http://www.larkc.eu for info on [[http://www.larkc.eu/consortium|consortium]], [[http://www.larkc.eu/consortium-2/|people involved]], [[http://www.larkc.eu/2008/larkc-leaflet|project description in 1 page]], [[http://www.larkc.eu/2008/icsc-2008-larkc-paper/|project description in 8 pages]], [[http://www.larkc.eu/deliverables/|full list of deliverabes]], etc.

== Dissemination, Training, Standards ==
InternalTraining collects resources for mutual education of the LarKC partners. <<BR>>Feel free to contribute pointers on these topics, or add additional topics.

ExternalTraining will eventually contain material for educating external parties on how to use the LarKC platform.

The [[Dissemination]] page lists our thinking, plans and activities to get LarKC into the world at large.

TechnologyTopics is a list of different technologies and topics that are relevant to LarKC. <<BR>>Feel free to contribute pointers on these topics, or add additional topics. Feel free to contribute pointers on these topics, or add additional topics.
