  <h1>SpeedDate data exchanges</h1>
  <dl class="faq">
    <dt>What am I looking at?</dt>
    <dd>On the right you see an animation of MaRVIN peers exchanging data (you 
    may need to zoom in). The horizontal axis shows 100 different peers, the 
    vertical axis shows 100 different keys. Each white dot at (x,y) means that 
    peer X holds one piece of data with key Y. The brighter the dot, the more 
    data this peer has.
    </dd>
    <dt>What is the data exchange strategy?</dt>
    <dd>In this animation, peers exchange data according to a 
    <b>speed-dating</b> strategy, which is our hybrid technique between the 
    targeted model of a DHT and the uniform model of the random exchange. Peers 
    try to specialise and ask for only "their" data items, but also offer help 
    to overloaded peers around them. The result is a clustering of data around 
    the peer responsible, with close-by peers helping out.
    <dt>What are the advantages of this strategy?</dt>
    <dd>With this approach, the peers maintain optimal load balance, as in the 
    random distribution. On the other hand, data items meet almost as much as in 
    the directed approach of the DHT. Thus, for our particular task, it seems 
    that this hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds.</dd>
    <dt>What are the disadvantages of this strategy?</dt>
    <dd>We don't know yet how well the strategy scales with more nodes, more 
    keys, and more data: we don't know yet how it behaves in different 
    circumstances. We are continuing our research to find answers to these 
    questions.</dd>
