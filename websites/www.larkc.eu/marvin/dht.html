  <h1>DHT data exchanges</h1>
  <dl class="faq">
    <dt>What am I looking at?</dt>
    <dd>On the right you see an animation of MaRVIN peers exchanging data (you 
    may need to zoom in). The horizontal axis shows 100 different peers, the 
    vertical axis shows 100 different keys. Each white dot at (x,y) means that 
    peer X holds one piece of data with key Y. The brighter the dot, the more 
    data this peer has.
    </dd>
    <dt>What is the data exchange strategy?</dt>
    <dd>In this animation, peers exchange data similarly to a <b>DHT</b>: based on a hash of the data, they 
    pick the peer responsible for this key, and give him some all pieces of their data that "belong" to him.
    <dt>What are the advantages of this strategy?</dt>
    <dd>Such a DHT-like exchange are very efficient for our task.
    We want to reason with triples, which means that triples with a shared key should meet at one 
    peer to derive a consequence. With these targeted exchanges, since all 
    triples that share a key are sent to the same peer, their chance of meeting 
    is maximal. Within a limited amount of exchanges (depending on the bandwith 
    they have for sending and receiving data) all data items will be at the peer 
    "responsible" for them, and will have met their "buddy" triples to produce a 
    consequence.</dd>

    <dt>What are the disadvantages of this strategy?</dt>
    <dd>This approach ignores load balancing. Since keys in triples are very 
    unevenly distributed (some terms are much more popular than others), 
    some peers will be "responsible" for much more triples than others. This 
    means that some peers will be overloaded and others will be 
    underutilised.</dd>
