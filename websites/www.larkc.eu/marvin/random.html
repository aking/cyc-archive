  <h1>Random data exchanges</h1>
  <dl class="faq">
    <dt>What am I looking at?</dt>
    <dd>On the right you see an animation of MaRVIN peers exchanging data (you 
    may need to zoom in). The horizontal axis shows 100 different peers, the 
    vertical axis shows 100 different keys. Each white dot at (x,y) means that 
    peer X holds one piece of data with key Y. The brighter the dot, the more 
    data this peer has.
    </dd>
    <dt>What is the data exchange strategy?</dt>
    <dd>In this animation, peers exchange data <b>randomly</b>: they randomly 
    pick some other peer, and give him some random part of their own data.
    <dt>What are the advantages of this strategy?</dt>
    <dd>Random exchanges maintain optimal load-balance: all peers have 
    approximately the same amount of data. This means that no peer is overloaded 
    and no peer is underutilised.</dd>
    <dt>What are the disadvantages of this strategy?</dt>
    <dd>Random exchanges are not very efficient for our task. We want to reason 
    with triples, which means that triples with a shared key should meet at one 
    peer to derive a consequence. With random exchanges, the chances of triples 
    meeting is quite low.</dd>
