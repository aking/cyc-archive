This allows rules without exceptions to never have to incur the
overhead of default reasoning.

Exceptions to rules are written like so:

  (Except-When R(x1,...,xn) Rule001)

and get canonicalized into rules concluding abnormal like so:

  R(x1,...,xn) => (Abnormal(x1,....,xn) Rule001)

Since a different 'abnormality' predicte is needed for every default
rule in the system, we instead handle this uniqueness requirement by
having a single Abnormal predicate which takes the rule in question
as an argument.

Also, the variables over which abnormality is computed is given as a
single list.  This allows Abnormal to be binary rather than
arbitrary arity. "))

Inanimate devices are sometimes considered agents, in certain contexts.  This is one of those concepts which is important yet very hard to define precisely.  Here is some elaboration, to help convey the intended meaning of the basic criterion for agenthood:  It must seem that a kind of decision-making is going on, even if it's down at the `mindless' level of the reflex reaction of a spider leg to heat, or the reflex reaction of a Human Resources Department rejecting an applicant with no formal degree.  It generally `sounds right' or `feels  natural' to assign causality to agents, rather than some larger or smaller entity.  E.g., it is more natural to say `Fred wrote an essay' than to say `Fred's left hand wrote an essay' or, at the other extreme, to say `The Solar System wrote an essay'.

              "A collection of tangible things.  An instance of Artifact is a tangible which was more or less intentionally created by an Agent (or a group of Agents working together) to serve some purpose or perform some function.  By `created', we don't require that the matter itself be created, it is often just the result of some sort of assemblage or modification process, such as a wooden flute that's been whittled from a tree branch, a sawhorse that's been put together out of boards and nails, a coin that's been minted by embossing or by melting liquid silver into a mold, etc.

Let's consider some positive and negative examples.

In addition to the obvious human artifacts (buildings, tools, textiles, power lines), this collection includes certain sorts of things made by Animals, such as bird nests, termite mounds, and beaver dams.

Something which just barely squeaks through the intended meaning of this concept is Yale-University.  In addition to the abstract legal entity, it consists of a set of physical buildings, furnishings, etc.  By contrast, an organization that had no headquarters building, equipment, tangible property, etc. would not be an artifact.  Similarly, a fictional character such as Tom Sawyer is not an artifact (in the context of the story, Tom is not an artifact because he is a real boy; in the context of the real world, Tom is not an artifact because he has no tangible component whatsoever.)

While some artifacts may be alive, or contain living subparts, we do not intend this collection to encompass all organisms which resulted from normal biological reproductive processes.  Your child is not an artifact.

If you do an oil painting of a house that is an artifact, but much more borderline is what you get if you take a rock and just paint it a solid color, say white.  In general that won't be an artifact unless it serves some purpose, such as marking the shoulder of a roadway, but more questionable cases are if the purpose of the white rock is just `to be sold as art' or `to look pretty.'  The white rock might thus be an artifact in certain contexts, but not in others.

Not every instance of Path-Generic (q.v.) is necessarily an instance of Artifact.  For example, some channels used for navigation may not be artifacts, because even though they are marked with human artifacts (i.e., channel markers) as locations where ships may safely travel, the channel itself may have been a naturally occurring pre-existing thing -- e.g., the English-Channel.  If a Channel-Wide-Strait were produced or maintained only by constant dredging, it might count as an artifact.  By contrast, each Canal, such as Suez-Canal, is almost certain to be an Artifact."))

This is stronger than material implication; i.e., it must also be the case that (:=> p1 p2).  Note that Causes means more than Implies, of course: there is a temporal ordering involved, there is a presumed mechanism of causation, etc.  Unlike Implies, Causes is not reflexive; one would not say that p1 causes p1, even though p1 implies p1.  Another difference between Implies and Causes is that Causes is a predicate, not a logical connective.  Just because (Causes p1 p2) is true that does NOT entail that (Causes (:not p2) (:not p1)) is true.Note that (Causes p1 p2) is generally a more accurate way of talking about causation than saying that some event e1 caused event e2 (which one can do in Cyc, using the predicate Caused-By) since often there are a few key aspects of e1 that caused a few key aspects of e2, and the remaining details of e1 and e2 were, to first order, irrelevant.  Note that, similarly, (Causes p1 p2) is generally a more accurate way of talking about causation than saying that some agent AGT caused something to be true (which one can do in Cyc, using the predicate Causes-Prop) since often there is some specific aspect of the agent, or something they were involved in or did, that is the cause of the proposition's becoming satisfied.  Because this predicate is asymetric and since effect (p2) can not temporally precede cause (p1), Causes may not be used to express mutual causation, e.g. feedback loops for which it may be said that two events (probably more process-like) cause each other.  We consider mutual causation to be a different form of causation and should be expressed using some as of yet (Dec 96) unreified relationship."))

Every instance of Chemical-Compound-Type is a subset of Tangible-Thing whose instances are defined ONLY by their chemical composition, and not by their physical state or any other property.  In Cyc's current representation, Chemical-Compound-Types can be of two varieties:  (1) Collections whose instances are completely uniform with each other in terms of chemical composition; this includes (a) the chemical elements -- such as Carbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen -- which are instances of Element-Stuff-Type-By-Number-Of-Protons (thus, the latter is a subset of Chemical-Compound-Type), and (b) compounds constituted of more than one substance chemically bonded, e.g., Water, Caffeine, and Iron-Oxide.  (2) Substances which have a general chemical specification, that is, whose instances do not have exactly the same chemical composition but fall within certain specifications, e.g., DNA.  Cyc's current theory includes those cases in Chemical-Compound-Type, though they are arguably borderline.  (Future work may require the creation of type collections to identify various levels of chemical specification, such as `exact formula' or `exact structure'.)
Note: Collections which Cyc does NOT classify as Chemical-Compound-Types include collections of substances which have some component which is of overriding significance in some context, so that in everyday language such substances are frequently referred to by the name of their important component (e.g., `penicillin' applied to a tablet containing penicillin), but which have significant admixtures of other substances.  Our representation distinguishes between the chemical compound (here, instances of Penicillin) and the mixture of substances in a tablet containing some Penicillin for pharmaceutical use.  Thus, Penicillin is an instance of Chemical-Compound-Type, but the collection of tablets containing penicillin and including other ingredients are not.  Also, subsets of Mixture, such as Lemonade, are not instances of Chemical-Compound-Type, because mixtures are determined by their physical state rather than solely by their chemical composition."))

Sets, however, differ from collections in that a mathematical set may be an arbitrary set of things which have nothing in common (see Set-Mathematical).  In contrast, the elements of a collection will all have in common some feature(s), some `intensional' qualities.  In addition, two instances of Collection can be co-extensional (i.e., have all the same elements) without being identical, whereas if two arbitrary sets had the same elements, they would be considered equal.   As with any Cyc constant, an instance of Collection should be created only if it is expected to have some purpose or utility.  Moreover, the `best' collections to create are the ones which are impossible to define precisely, yet about which there are rules and other things to say.  E.g., `WhiteCat' is not a good element of Collection to create, because it's easy to define with other Cyc concepts, and there's not much to say about the collection of white cats; but `WhiteCollarWorker' could be a good element of Collection, because it is hard to define exactly, yet there are many things to say about it."))

Suppose predicate P is an instance of Cotemporal-Objects-Slot.  If (P X Y) holds, then it must be the case that (Cotemporal X Y).  For example, consider the binary predicate Owns, which is an instance of Cotemporal-Objects-Slot.  To represent `Nick owned Spot in 1992' we could create the appropriate cotemporal subabstractions of each, and assert (Owns NickIn1992 SpotIn1992), and this would satisfy the constraint introduced when we declared Owns to be a Cotemporal-Objects-Slot.  More tersely, we could use Holds-In (qv) and just assert (Holds-In (Year-Fn 1992) (Owns Nick Spot)), since Holds-In implicitly treats instances of Something-Existing as their appropriate subabstractions.  Alternatively, we could create a context (a microtheory) one of whose assumptions was a temporal one, limiting all axioms to holding during 1992, and then in that context we could simply assert (Owns Nick Spot).

Each element of Cotemporal-Predicate is a Cyc predicate whose temporal arguments (i.e., arguments having a temporal extent) must be Cotemporal, i.e., they have the same temporal starting points and ending points.  Moreover, all the temporal arguments of all the cotemporal predicates involved in a single axiom must be Cotemporal.  Since this is a very common and important relationship, we'll consider a detailed example.   If I say `Fred owns a Camaro', what I really mean is that some Sub-Abstrac (i.e., a time-slice) of Fred, over some time interval INT (e.g., 1993-1995), owns some Sub-Abstrac of that Camaro, which exists over that very same time interval INT.  Fred may have owned many cars before and since, and that Camaro may have had many owners before and since, but one time-slice of Fred owned one time-slice of that car.  Common sense tells us that the time interval (INT) must have been the same in both cases; Cyc can infer this commonsensical conclusion from our having told it that Owns is a cotemporal relation, i.e., (:instance-of Owns Cotemporal-Predicate).  A ternary example is `between', as in `Lucy is between Fred and Ethel'.  Not all predicates are elements of Cotemporal-Predicate, of course; consider `remembers' -- I (today) remember my father as he was forty years ago.  There are some borderline cases here; Sees clearly belongs to Cotemporal-Predicate, but in the case of someone smelling another object (cf. Smells) it is less clearcut, since one can smell an object that has ceased to exist."))

Note: This collection includes all instances of legal tender, worldwide and historically.  But, for better or worse, the notion of legal tender is context-dependent.  Normally what counts as currency is relative to the country one is in; legal tender in the United States is not the same as legal tender in China.  (Though US dollars may have excellent value on the black market.)  What counts as legal tender depends on historical events as well, since a government may change, withdraw, or cancel some types of currency it previously authorized.  Also, conquest of one country by another usually brings about the collapse of the loser's currency.

              "(Domain-Assumptions M P) means that the microtheory M has the proposition P as a domain assumption.  See the comment for Microtheory for a detailed explanation of what the `assumptions' of a mt are, as opposed to its `content'.  In brief, it means that all the `content' assertions of M assume that P is true.  Another way of thinking of this is that one is `in' context M only if all its domain assumptions are true.  Another way of thinking of this is that the various `content' assertions of M only apply to objects that satisfy all its Domain-Assumptions.  Yes, that means that the `domain of quantifiers' (For-All and There-Exists) is limited to the universe of such objects.  So if it's true in M that (For-All ?x Q), and if we lift this axiom to another theory M2 that does not make the domain assumption P, then the axiom becomes (For-All ?x (:=> P Q)).  

Note:  Actually, what becomes true in M2 is slightly more complicated, namely: (For-All ?x (:=> (:and P1 P2 P3...) Q)), where P1, P2, P3,... are all the domain assumptions of M which are not implied by the domain assumptions of M2.

Note:  Domain assumption propositions --- in this case P --- must have a special format:  P must contain the free variable ?U, and this ?U represents `some term which is talked about in M'.  The idea is that one could have a domain assumption that said `if ?U is a person, ?U must have been born after 1950', or which said `if ?U is the performer of an event, then ?U is a person' etc.  For example:  (:=> (:instance-of ?U Physical-State-Change-Event) (:instance-of ?U Creation-Or-Destruction-Event)) is one of the Domain-Assumptions of the Naive-State-Change-Mt context.  It says that, in that context, physical state changes of an object (e.g., melting or boiling) are viewed as creations and destructions, in which elements of Entity come into or go out of existence, rather than viewing them as events which preserve entityhood."))

As its two arguments, For-All takes a variable (which is an element of CycEL-Variable) and an element of Cyc-Formula, respectively.  (For-All VAR FORM) means that FORM is true whenever all the occurrences of the variable VAR in the formula FORM are replaced by any object in the Cyc universe.  For example, to say that every person is a mammal, we could assert: (For-All ?X (:=> (:instance-of ?X Person) (:instance-of ?X Mammal))).  In addition, CycL follows a convention that allows For-All to be omitted; that is, when no explicit quantifier is used, seemingly unbound variables inside formulas are assumed to be universally quantified.  With that convention, the sample assertion could be written more compactly as: (:=> (:instance-of ?X Person) (:instance-of ?X Mammal)).



[Developer-level footnote:  There are many `flavors' of quantification `on the market' these days; here is how the Cyc system currently handles axioms that involve For-All:



When processing an FI-ASK about whether an assertion of the form (For-All VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc determines extensionally whether or not any known VAR (anything in the knowledge base) could make FORM false.



When processing an FI-PROVE about whether an assertion of the form (For-All VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc tries to construct an intensional proof (at least at a default-true level) that FORM must be true regardless of what VAR is ever inserted therein.



When processing an FI-ASSERT in which a user or program tells Cyc that an assertion of the form (For-All VAR FORM) is true, Cyc records it intensionally so that it can later serve as part of an intensional proof, when some future FI-PROVE request is processed.]"))

              "Elements of the collection Format are attributes that are used to constrain the multi-valued nature of a Predicate.  Consider a predicate PRED which takes five arguments, and fix any four of those arguments -- say arguments 1, 2, 4, and 5.  The number of different legal values there can be for the third argument (given that we've already chosen the other four) is determined by which Format attribute has been specified for the 3rd argument place of PRED..





(1) If the Arg3-Format for PRED is Single-Entry, then there can be at most one single term that's legal (and thus at most one assertion), for those given values of arguments 1, 2, 4, and 5.  To illustrate, let's consider a predicate with a lower Arity, say (Mother CHILD MOM), which says that the mother of CHILD is MOM.  The Arg2-Format for Mother should be Single-Entry, since an animal can have only one biological mother.





(2) If the Arg3-Format of PRED is Set-The-Format, then there may be any number of assertions with different terms in the third argument position, but sharing the same values for arguments 1, 2, 4, and 5.  E.g., the Arg1-Format for Mother should be Set-The-Format, since a female can have multiple children.





(3) If the Arg3-Format of PRED is Interval-Entry, then there may be multiple assertions sharing the values of 1, 2, 4, and 5, but with different terms in the 3rd argument; however, all the values for the 3rd argument must be overlapping elements of Scalar-Interval (q.v.).  E.g., the height of a person might be specified in several ways, with slightly different margins of error (or approximation), which is fine, but all those alternate values had better have SOME overlap since the person really just has one particular true height at any given time."))

The Genl-Mt relation is transitive; it induces a partial ordering on the set of all microtheories.   

Each assertion in the knowledge base must be explicitly stated to be true in at least one mt.  It will then (by inference) also be true in all the more specialized contexts.  If something is true in the `life in North America' mt, then it should by default be true in the `life in Canada' mt.  I.e., the microtheories are organized into a generalization/specialization lattice by the predicate Genl-Mt, just as collections are organized into such a lattice by :subclass-of, and just as predicates are organized into such a lattice by Genl-Preds.  Just as a collection may have several incommensurable supersets, so too a microtheory may have several incommensurable Genl-Mts.

I.e., the performer handles an object which happens to be a device, but not just lugging it around but actually employing it for its intended Primary-Function --- not merely to look at it or rearrange or relocate it.  For example, if you move a fork from the dishwasher to the silverware drawer, that's just HandlingAnObject@cyc; if you use that fork to eat some food, though, that is an instance of Handling-A-Device."))

Note:  Obviously there are no real units of measure for this quantity, ways of objectively measuring the amount of happiness possessed or gained or lost, etc., but still this has proven to be a useful way for Cyc to represent and reason with emotions.  E.g., one can have a rule that says that most people have a greater `amount' of happiness at their wedding than at their high school graduation, etc.  There are functions, such as Low-Amount-Fn, which take a Primitive-Attribute-Type (such as the instances of Feeling-Attribute-Type) such as Happiness and return as their value a certain-sized amount of that feeling; e.g., (Low-Amount-Fn Happiness) is an expression whose value is a positive but small amount of happiness, and that in turn will be an element of Happiness (and also will be an element of Feeling-Attribute and an element of Attribute-Value, etc.)  Feeling-Attribute-Types organize into a lattice; e.g., there are several more specialized forms of Happiness that are present in Cyc's ontology, such as Elation, Delight, Triumph-The-Feeling, etc."))

Each element of Illocutionary-Force is a specialized component of a communication; its function is to indicate how the speaker in a communication wants the agent(s) whom s/he is addressing to understand, and respond to, the situation--i.e., the state of affairs--described in that communication.  Isolating the `illocutionary force' of a communication allows us to characterize the intention of a speaker; e.g., whether s/he means to assert that the described state of affairs in fact holds; or to express a desire that such a state of affairs hold; or to command someone to make that state of affairs hold; or to offer to make the state of affairs hold.  S/he may even intend to make something true by stating it (e.g., ``I name this ship `The Intrepid'.''). 
Usually, apprehending a speaker's intention is important for understanding what s/he means and what s/he intends the hearer to do.  Although illocutionary forces can be represented propositionally, they are not generally communicated so explicitly.  For example, questions in English are typically communicated by inverting subject-object word order and raising one's intonation at the end of the utterance.  (The intonation marker so strongly indicates a question that it may suffice without the inverted word order, as in `You are going tonight' uttered with a rising intonation.)  Commands in English typically have an (unexpressed) understood subject and perhaps a forceful tone.  In every culture and language there are conventional sets of commonly used illocutionary forces which would be the subsets of Illocutionary-Force for that culture; e.g., in English, they include Inform contexts, Request, Offer, Promise, and Query.
Note: although in this comment Illocutionary-Force is explained in terms of utterances, it applies to communication generally; so `speaker' and `listener' should be broadly interpreted to mean, respectively, any Sender-Of-Info and Recipient-Of-Info.  See also Communicating, Communication-Act-Single.  The portion of a communication's information content that represents the illocutionary force is indicated using ComponentIF."))

Or we may be even less detailed in our descriptions, perhaps caring only whether someone is more than four feet tall, or `Tall enough to ride' on an amusement park ride.  By allowing an Interval-Entry Format (qq.v.) in the second argument of the measuring predicate, we are telling Cyc that it's okay to describe the (e.g.) Height-Of-Object in several different ways, with varying levels of precision, SO LONG AS all of the measurements asserted for the same object `overlap'.  For example, it is consistent to say both that Jenny is 4'10'' tall, between four and five feet tall, and that she is `Tall enough to ride' the Dodgems (provided that `Tall enough to ride' is an interval whose minimum is at 4'10'' or lower).  Even though there is only one height of a person in reality, using an Interval-Based-Quantity-Slot allows us to represent that height in many different ways, avoiding contradictions while still checking for consistency.  For example, asserting both that Jeff's Height-Of-Object is 5'9'' and in the range 4.5-5.5 feet tall is an inconsistency."))

  "When to use Isa, Main-Constituent, or Constituents.  We develop the following example as a basis for explaining the differences.  

Consider X, where (:instance-of X Water). If we add some other substance(s) to X, to the point where the mixture acquires some salient characteristic(s) different from Water while retaining all the main properties, then we should assert (Main-Constituent X W), where W is the original water -- i.e., (:instance-of W Water) -- and X is the whole new mixture of W with some other stuff(s).  Suppose we add enough enough other stuff that the physical properties of the mixture become significantly different from those of water; then we should assert only (Constituents X W).  

Isa - Use Isa if X would commonly be referred to as `water', including cases in which a small number of minor characteristics are different due to some admixture.   

Examples (arguably, 3 and 4 are borderline cases): 

1. An instance of (Pure-Fn Water) Isa Water.  
2. An instance of Water-Ingestible Isa Water (but may have trace constituents).
3. An instance of Pool-Water Isa Water (but has some Chlorine as a salient Constituents). 
4. An instance of Sea-Water Isa Water (but has some Salt-Na-Cl as a salient Constituents).  


Main-Constituent - Use Main-Constituent when X contains other substances besides water, would NOT commonly referred to as `water', and yet has MOST of the material properties of water.  As a rule, most of the properties of the Main-Constituent transfer to the substance it's a part of.  Often such substances have at least one important and/or perceptible characteristic (due to admixture) that is quite different from the properties of water.  

Examples: 

1. An instance of Lemonade is NOT called `water' but has water as a Main-Constituent.  It tastes quite different from water.  It has nutritional (caloric) value.  It is a human-made beverage.  
2. An instance of Coffee-Beverage is NOT called `water' but has water as a Main-Constituent.  It tastes quite different from water.  It contains caffeine.  Also, a specific inference about coffee's (lack of) transparency should override the transparency which would otherwise be inferred from the material properties of its Main-Constituent.  
3. Aqueous hydrochloric acid has many of the properties of its main constituent, water -- for example, transparency, viscosity, density, freezing point, etc.  But it also has the very important difference that it is highly acidic, caustic, etc. -- and attributing to it water's potability would be disastrous.

Constituents - Use Constituents when X is NOT commonly referred to as `water' and has FEW properties of water, even though X contains water.  

Examples:

1. An instance of (Solid-Fn Gelatin) is NOT called `water', and though it has water among its Constituents, gelatin has very few of the properties of water. 
2. An instance of Concrete is NOT called `water'; though it has water among its Constituents, it has none of the salient characteristics of water.
3. An instance  of Mud is NOT called `water' and has few characteristics of water, though water is among its Constituents.  Its Main-Constituent is some portion of Soil."))

In addition to episodes of walking and swimming, Locomotion-Event includes events in which an agent moves itself using a device, with that agent supplying the motive force to the device -- as in instances of Pedaling-A-Bicycle, Ice-Skating, In-Line-Skating, etc.  Since the locomotor virtually always supplies the vast majority of the force required to make the motion happen, it is safe to infer that IF something plays the role of Provider-Of-Motive-Force, THEN it is an Object-Moving.  In certain abnormal situations this rule will make the wrong conclusions: e.g. if a mountain climber's assent is aided by another stationary person above.  Some locomotion events are also transportation events, e.g. when someone is walking while carrying something else.
Note: Elements of Locomotion-Event may be `non-homogeneous' (by contrast, each Locomotion-Process is `homogeneous.')  That is, if you take Time-Slices of a Locomotion-Event, they may or may not be Locomotion-Events.

Note that this is not quite the same thing as the granularity of a process, such as Animal-Walking-Process, where if you take a fine enough time-slice you are just lifting your leg up into the air.  In the case of a Locomotion-Event such as scaling a sheer rock wall, very little of the time actually involves the motion of your body up the wall. "))

  "If one wishes to state a fact M about an assertion A, i.e. if one wishes to assert the meta-assertion M(A) and if A canonicalizes into multiple assertions, a_1, a_2...a_n,then one must do a non-standard procedure.  Due to the way the canonicalizer currently (Nov 96) handles meta-assertions, rather than simply asserting M(A), one must distribute the meta-assertion over the results of canonicalization.  That is one must assert M(a_1), M(a_2)...M(a_n). Consider the following example:  Suppose one wanted to assert 
`if a movement occurs then there is a friction Sub-Events, unless the movement is frictionless.'
The way one asserts this is by first asserting the fact without the `unless', i.e.

(ke-assert '(:=>
	     (:instance-of ?MOV Movement-Event)
              (exists ?FRIC
	      (:and
	       (:instance-of ?FRIC Friction-Process)
	       (Sub-Events ?MOV ?FRIC)))) BaseKB)

Because there is an And with two literals on the right hand side of this rule it canonicalizes into two assertions which then become part of the KB.  One must next find these assertions as they appear in the KB:

(:=>
 (:and
  (:instance-of ?MOV Movement-Event)
  (Term-Of-Unit ?FRIC-EVENT146 (SKF-29707602 ?MOV)))
 (:instance-of ?FRIC-EVENT146 Friction-Process))

(:=>
 (:and
  (:instance-of ?MOV Movement-Event)
  (Term-Of-Unit ?FRIC-EVENT146 (SKF-29707602 ?MOV)))
 (Sub-Events ?MOV ?FRIC-EVENT146)).

Now using these one may state the `unless' part of the rule:

(ke-assert
  '(Except-When
    (:instance-of ?MOV Frictionless-Motion)
    (:=>
     (:and
      (:instance-of ?MOV Movement-Event)

             (Documentation Microtheory
              "The collection of all microtheories, or `mts' for short.  Microtheories implement contexts in Cyc.  Each mt serves to group a set of assertions together that share some common assumptions.  Thus each mt can be thought of as having two parts: a corpus of assertions that represent the `content' of the mt, and a separate corpus of assertions that represent the `assumptions' which are being made.  E.g., in a normal modern everyday life microtheory, there might be hundreds of content assertions such as `drivers are at least 16 years old', and there might be dozens of assumption assertions about that microtheory's content, such as `all actors are assumed to be law-abiding'.   You can think of the assumptions as a set of extra conjuncts on the left hand side (the antecedent or `if'-part) of every content assertion in the mt.  

Each assertion in the knowledge base must be explicitly stated to be true in at least one mt.  It will then (by inference) also be true in all the more specialized contexts.  If something is true in the `life in North America' mt, then it should by default be true in the `life in Canada' mt.  I.e., the microtheories are organized into a generalization/specialization lattice by the predicate Genl-Mt (q.v.), just as collections are organized into such a lattice by :subclass-of, and just as predicates are organized into such a lattice by Genl-Preds.  Just as a collection may have several incommensurable supersets, so too a microtheory may have several incommensurable Genl-Mts.  Just as each and every collection must have some explicitly recorded superset (except for Thing), each and every mt must have some (expicitly recorded) more general mt (except for the BaseKB, which is the most general context, containing universal, timeless truths).  Just as a Cyc concept may have multiple incommensurable sets of which it is an element (via Isa), so too a Cyc assertion may be declared to be true in a set of incommensurable mts.

Every query is made in some mt, so the answer you get might very well depend on the mt in which you ask the question.  Let's call the current context C1, for the remainder of this paragraph.  The only assertions which can be used in C1 to answer the query are those assertions which were explicitly stated to be true in C1 or in some more general mt than C1.  But what if you want and need something like assertion P, to answer the question, but P doesn't fit that criterion, though P is true in some other mts that are unrelated to C1?  You can `import' or `lift' P into C1, by conjoining to its left hand side (if-part) the various assumptions of a context C999 in which P is known to be true.  I.e., what you actually conclude to be true in C1 is an assertion of the form `if a1 and a2 and... then P', where a1, a2,... are the assumptions of a context in which P holds (but which are NOT implied by assumptions of C1).  When there are several contexts to choose from, from which to import P, you will usually prefer the context whose assumptions are most similar to C1's assumptions, so there will be few extra conjuncts that need to be inserted in the `lifting' process.

There is an implicit third component to each Microtheory, namely the Cyc terms which are `known about' in that mt.  E.g., Lenat is not `known about' in a microtheory set in prehistoric times; Photochemical-Energy-Transduction is not `known about' in a microtheory representing things that a toddler believes to be true; etc.  Unlike the content and the assumptions, however, there is no need to explicitly collect into one list all the terms which are `known about'.  Rather, one could compute such a list by looking at all the terms which are mentioned anywhere in the content assertions of the mt.

Note that Microtheory is itself a `first-class object', as is each and every element of that collection --- e.g., Commercial-Buying-Mt, World-Geography-Mt, US-Healthcare-Mt, Human-Social-Life-Mt, etc.  The assertions about a Microtheory are just like any other Cyc assertions.  

Note that one important predicate we haven't mentioned here yet is the one that says `assertion P is true in microtheory M'.  That predicate is Ist.  Thus:  (Ist M P).

Note that another important predicate we haven't mentioned here yet is the one that says `microtheory M has the proposition P as a domain assumption'.  Thus: (Domain-Assumptions M P)."))

Thus, `believes' is a modal relationship.  So are meta-predicates such as My-Creator: e.g., suppose that Doug Lenat added the term FirstUSPresident to the Cyc ontology, and Cyc later is told that that person was George Washington, who in turn is represented by the term George-Washington, which term was NOT entered by Doug but by Karen Pittman; it would be incorrect to substitute equals for equals [that is, to substitute George-Washington for FirstUSPresident] in the assertion (My-Creator FirstUSPresident Lenat) and conclude (My-Creator George-Washington Lenat), since Doug did not enter the latter term into Cyc's ontology.  Thus, meta-predicates such as My-Creator are also modal relationships.

              "Movement-Event is the most general collection of events which are physical movements.  Each element of Movement-Event is an action primarily about some element(s) of Partially-Tangible rotating or translating, periodically or nonperiodically, with respect to some frame of reference which is not a part of the Object-Moving.  Thus, Neil Armstrong stepping from the lunar landing module onto the Moon's surface is an instance of Movement-Event.  Another element of this collection: the turning of the Earth on its axis 31 times during the month of August 1996.  Li Xiaoshuang's compulsory floor exercise in the 1996 Olympics Men's Gymnastics Team Competition is also a (complex!) movement event.  















Note on what is NOT included in this concept:  Consider a person raising her hand and waving, or a tree whose branches are bending in a strong wind:  the person and the tree are remaining in the same place, so that person and that tree are not moving in the sense of Movement-Event (though the hand and the branches are).  In other words, `performers' which do not, as a whole, rotate or translate are not Actors in any element of Movement-Event.  However, the waving person and tree events would have Sub-Events which DO belong to Movement-Event, in which a hand, a branch, etc., `moves' in this sense.  Note also that elements of Transformation-Event, such as a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, or of Shaping-Something, such as molding a piece of clay into the bust of Napoleon, are also not necessarily elements of this collection, because they do not involve motion of the whole object with respect to some frame of reference that is different from the object's.  (See also Frame-Of-Reference.)















Note: When classifying something into Movement-Event, one should consider (1) is it translational or rotational motion?  (2) is it periodic or nonperiodic?  (3) does it involve a continuous flow or a discrete (an object or objects moving completely from one place to another) motion? (4) does it involve a location change or no location change? (5) does it involve a single pathway or more than one?  Based on the answers to those questions, one or more of these subsets of Movement-Event may more precisely represent the moving: Movement-Translation-Event, Movement-Rotation, Movement-Periodic, Movement-Non-Periodic, Translation-Flow, Translation-Complete, Translation-Single-Path, Translation-Multi-Path."))

states that, in situations where assertion Q would apply to a variable
?x0, the conclusion is allowed `except for' the situations where [term]
is the binding for ?x0.  To be well-formed, Q must be a rule with
exactly one free variable.

By definition, Except-For is merely syntactic sugar:
  (Except-For [term] Q(?x0)) 
  <=> 
  (Except-When (equals ?x0 [term]) Q(?x0))
Since an Except-When statement is a meta-statement about some rule 
Q(?x0 ... ?xn), the statement is not well-formed if Q(?x0 ... ?xn) is
not already an assertion in the KB.  Also, strictly speaking, P and Q in
the Except-When merely must share some variables rather than all
variables as it's been written above.

become:

The predicate `abnormal' has not actually gone away, but was modified for use as the HL (Heuristic Level) implementation of Except-When.  Like Term-Of-Unit, `abnormal' should be viewed as an inference-maintained predicate, and human beings should not be manually asserting things using `abnormal.'

              "Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval, a subset of Scalar-Interval, is the collection of intervals which represent significant differences in quantity, for the various types of measurable properties.  The most familiar case is for numbers, in which orders of magnitudes typically correspond with powers of 10; thus, in any given numerical quantity, the 100's dominate the 10's or the units, which are negligible with respect to the hundreds.  In Cyc, we can identify the significant intervals for any measurable property.  For example, for Time, some intervals which represent orders of magnitude are: A-Few-Seconds-Duration, A-Few-Minutes-Duration, A-Few-Hours-Duration, A-Few-Days-Duration, A-Few-Weeks-Duration, etc.  Similar scales could be identified for any measurable property.  Moreover, orders of magnitude for the same measurable property may differ between microtheories; e.g., the orders of magnitude for Time in a `GeologicalTimeMt' would be much larger than those listed above, which are relevant for human perceptions and activities.  



Any two attributes which represent amounts of the same kind of property (e.g., time, distance) and which are also elements of Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval will be assumed to differ so substantially in size that the smaller one (and values associated with it) will be insignificant compared to the larger interval (and values associated with it).  That is, in general and as a default, if ORD1 and ORD2 are two different elements of Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval which are also elements of the same type of Attribute-Value (e.g., Speed, Mass, Density), then one is negligible with respect to the other.  To know which dominates the other, we need additional knowledge about their relative size, e.g., that ORD2 is a Following-Value of (i.e., 'bigger' than) ORD1.  See also NegligibleWRT, Following-Value.  The predicate Order-Of-Magnitude (q.v.) is used to relate particular quantities to the appropriate element of Order-Of-Magnitude-Interval.  For example, two days -- in Cyc, (Days-Duration 2) -- has the Order-Of-Magnitude A-Few-Days-Duration."))

Each element of Predicate is a truth-functional relationship in Cyc which takes some number of arguments; each of those arguments must be of some particular type.  For example, the predicate :subclass-of, which represents the subset/superset relation between collections, takes two arguments; each argument must be an element of Collection.  The numbers and types of arguments to particular predicates are specified by explicit assertions using Arity, Arg1-Isa, Arg2-Isa, etc., Arg1-Genl, Arg2-Genl, etc.  Our example :subclass-of has Arity 2, and both its Arg1-Isa and its Arg2-Isa have the value Collection.  







Informally, you can think of elements of Predicate as functions that always return either true or false.  More formally, when an element of Predicate is applied to the legal number and type of arguments, an expression is formed which is a well-formed formula (wff) in CycL.  Such expressions are called `atomic formulas' if they contain variables, and `gafs' (short for `ground atomic formulas') if they contain no variables.  







Note that in Cyc, relationships involving opaque contexts (such as modal contexts, propositional attitudes) are NOT included in Predicate@cyc; see Modal-Relationship instead.  Quantifiers and logical operators are also excluded from Predicate@cyc; see Quantifier, Logical-Connective.











Currently (July 1996), the KB includes predicates of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 arguments; i.e., Arity may have a value between 1 and 5, inclusive.  The KB also includes some predicates of variable arity (see Variable-Arity-Relation).  Unary predicates, which take just one single argument (e.g., `-- is a person' or `-- is white', are usually represented in Cyc by elements of Collection or Attribute-Value, rather than of Predicate@cyc; but see also Unary-Predicate.  Naming strings for elements of Predicate always begin with a lowercase letter."))

They are both abstract entities, lacking spatial and temporal properties.  More specifically, they (can) have elements, and hence may stand to one another in set-theoretic relations such as Subset-Of and Disjoint-With.  Nevertheless, sets and collections differ in two important respects.  Every collection is associated with an intensional criterion for membership -- a more or less natural property or group of properties possessed by its members.  (The criterion for membership need not, and often will not, be precisely definable in any language.)  Collections are thus akin to kinds.  In contrast, the elements of a set are not required to be homogeneous in any respect; any things whatsoever may together comprise the members of a set.  The second major difference between sets and collections is that no two distinct sets can be co-extensional (be such that every element of one is an element of the other and conversely).  Sets are, so to speak, identified on the basis of their extensions.  Collections, on the other hand, are identified by their intensional criteria for membership.  So collections which have exactly the same elements may be distinct, differing in their respective membership criteria."))

All of the Linnaean sets, or collections, of animals can be grouped together into one set, or collection, of sets, which in turn is an instance of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection.   
It turns out that the real situation --- and the real definition of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection --- is slightly more complicated than that.  Consider types of appliances: toasters, cars, shavers, clocks, etc.  Is the set of such appliance-types a Sibling-Disjoint-Collection, the way we defined it above, for types of animals?  Almost, but not quite.  One could have an appliance-type `ClockRadio', which would be the set of all clock radios, and clearly each clock radio is both a clock and a radio, yet neither Clock nor Radio-Receiver is a subset of the other.  So if we have some item that purports to be both a clock and radio, that is okay if one of the following three conditions is met:
(1) the collection Clock is known to be a subset of RadioReceiver@cyc;
(2) the collection Radio-Receiver is known to be a subset of Clock@cyc;
(3) there is already defined a collection X which is a subset of both Clock and Radio-Receiver.
More formally, the axiom that defines Sibling-Disjoint-Collection is as follows: SIB is an element of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection if and only if:
(:=>
   (:and 
       (:instance-of C1 SIB) 
       (:instance-of C2 SIB) (:instance-of C1-EL C1)
       (Different C1 C2))
   (:or 
       (:not (:instance-of C1-EL C2)) 
       (exists C3 (:and (:subclass-of C3 C2) (:subclass-of C3 C1) (:instance-of C1-EL C3)))))
That axiom, together with the minimization of :subclass-of, gives us the following characterization of our concept:  If we have a collection SIB that is an element of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection, and if we take two elements C1 and C2 of that collection SIB, then each element of C1 which is not an element of a common specialization (C3) of C1 and C2, MUST NOT BE an element of C2.
In cases where there are a few exceptions --- that is, a couple of elements of SIB might have some overlap --- but it is undesirable to explicitly create a new reified constant (like `ClockRadio', above) for that intersection, Cyc allows you to use an explicit mechanism to override the Sibling-Disjoint-Collection constraints for a particular C1 and C2; namely, you would assert to Cyc (Sibling-Disjoint-Exceptions C1 C2).  See also Sibling-Disjoint-Exceptions."))

(See Sibling-Disjoint-Collection for a full explanation of the constraints.)   For example, Killing-Biological and Physically-Attacking-An-Agent are both elements of Default-Disjoint-Script-Type, which in turn is an element of Sibling-Disjoint-Collection.  The exception is useful in this case because it lifts the constraint that physically attacking and killing an agent must be disjoint from each other, while letting us continue to conclude that killing and attacking are each disjoint from many other kinds of actions.  By asserting (Sibling-Disjoint-Exceptions Killing-Biological Physically-Attacking-An-Agent), we block the disjointness constraint between those two collections, without disturbing the constraints between each of those collections and all the other instances of their parent (disjoint) collection, Default-Disjoint-Script-Type.  In other words, (Sibling-Disjoint-Exceptions COL1 COL2) prevents COL1 and COL2 from being considered disjoint if they would otherwise be disjoint due to their being both instances of the same Sibling-Disjoint-Collection."))

Whenever someone asserts to Cyc an expression that contains a `thereExists'@cyc, Cyc automatically creates a new element of Skolem-Function and rewrites the assertion using that skolem function, as described in what follows.  (Most Cyc users don't need to know the following details, which are supplied only for the curious.)







Suppose we tell Cyc that every animal has a birth date; i.e., for each animal, there exists a date such that the animal was born on that date --- in CycL, (:=> (:instance-of ?x Animal)(exists ?y (Birth-Date ?x ?y))).  In response to that CycL formula, Cyc would create a new element of Skolem-Function -- we might call it the `BirthDateFn' -- whose single argument would be an animal and whose resultant value would be a date, namely, that animal's date of birth.  Subsequently, Cyc would automatically use the `BirthDateFn' in asserting our rule, eliminating the need for a `thereExists'@cyc.  Our formula would thus be rewritten by the system, as follows:







(:=> 

   (:and

     (:instance-of ?x Animal)

     (Term-Of-Unit ?y (`BirthDateFn' ?x)))

   (Birth-Date ?x ?y)).





See also Term-Of-Unit. 





Note: Although our example uses the name 'BirthDateFn' for our skolem function, at this time (4/97), skolem functions are automatically named by the Cyc system using the prefix `SKF-' followed by a number.  The system-generated name can be replaced by re-naming, though that is rarely done in practice."))

              "(Temporally-Intrinsic-Arg PRED N) means that PRED expresses a property that is temporally intrinsic for its argument position N. That means, if a formula using PRED







is true for some object OBJ (in the Nth argument position), we can assume the truth of every similar formula in which any temporal part of OBJ is substituted in for OBJ. For







example, since (Temporally-Intrinsic-Arg Mass-Of-Object 1) is true, if we know (Mass-Of-Object `Rock37' (Gram 37)), we can expect that any temporal part of `Rock37', such as







`Rock37Today', will also have a mass of 37 grams. An example of a property which is not temporally intrinsic would be `average speed'. The average speed of a car







on a drive from Austin to Dallas might be 50 mph, but during particular sub-intervals of that drive the average speed could vary from 0 to 75 mph.  The collection Cotemporal-Predicate is a class of relations which 







are not temporally intrinsic but might at first seem to be, e.g., Physical-Parts. In (Physical-Parts `Joe' `JoesHead'), it is not the case







that every temporal part of `Joe' (such as `JoeToday') has `JoesHead' as a physical part.  Rather, `JoeToday' would have `JoesHeadToday' among its Physical-Parts. With Physical-Parts,







as with all other elements of Cotemporal-Predicate, every time-slice of the first argument is related to a cotemporal time-slice of the second argument, but that is not covered by







Temporally-Intrinsic-Arg and its associated axioms."))

Assertions with Term-Of-Unit are created by the system when a certain kind of non-atomic term (NAT) first appears in a Cyc formula; such a NAT consists of a Cyc function that is an element of Reifiable-Function, together with the correct number and type of arguments.  When such a NAT is first used in a formula, the Cyc system automatically creates a Cyc-constant data-structure to reify the NAT.  A name is automatically assigned to the new constant (i.e., the data-structure) by the Cyc system; currently (1997), the system is using for most of those constant names a string which is identical to the NAT.  One should not be misled by that into thinking that Term-Of-Unit is a specialization of Equals. 

The predicate Term-Of-Unit maps between the system-generated data-structure and the original non-atomic term.  (Term-Of-Unit NAT-CONSTANT NAT-EXPRESSION) tells us that the constant data-structure NAT-CONSTANT was created to reify the value of the non-atomic term NAT-EXPRESSION.  From now on, NAT-EXPRESSION will refer to the constant NAT-CONSTANT.

Examples of non-atomic terms (NATs) include: (Giga Dollars-Per-Year), (Repairing-Fn Automobile), and (The-Script-Fn Washing-Clothes-In-A-Machine). See also Non-Predicate-Function, Reifiable-Term.

Note: Term-Of-Unit assertions are entered in the BaseKB because the mapping between a NAT and the constant that was reified for it holds universally.  One should view Term-Of-Unit assertions as bits of bookkeeping knowledge which are very rarely, if ever, entered into the KB by hand."))

              "The predicate There-Exists is Cyc's version of the existential quantifier of predicate calculus (i.e., the operator symbolized in one common notation by a backwards 'E').  As its two arguments, There-Exists  takes a variable (which is an element of CycEL-Variable) and an element of Cyc-Formula, respectively.  (exists VAR FORM) means that FORM is true in at least one case (and possibly more) in which all occurrences of the variable VAR in FORM are replaced by an object in the Cyc universe.  For example, to say that every person has a mother, we could assert: (For-All ?X (:=> (:instance-of ?X Person) (exists ?Y (Mother ?X ?Y)))).   



[Developer-level footnote:  There are many `flavors' of quantification `on the market' these days; here is how the Cyc system currently handles axioms that involve There-Exists:



When processing an FI-ASK about whether (exists VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc determines extensionally whether or not any known VAR (anything in the knowledge base) satisfies FORM (makes it true.)



When processing an FI-PROVE about whether (exists VAR FORM) is true or not, Cyc tries to construct an intensional proof (at least at a default-true level) that there must exist some value of VAR --- which may or may not already be known in the KB -- for which FORM must be true.



When processing an FI-ASSERT in which a user or program tells Cyc that (exists VAR FORM) is true, Cyc records the assertion intensionally so that it can later serve as part of an intensional proof, when some future FI-PROVE request is processed.  It does this by creating a new Skolem-Function (q.v.).  



When modus ponens is used with a rule of the form (:=> ANTECEDENT (exists VAR FORM)), and the formula ANTECEDENT is true, then Cyc will generate a new term for VAR, add that to its language, and assert that the new term satisfies FORM.]"))

              "This predicate relates, e.g., a sleigh-ride event to the sleigh being used to transport the people and goods.  (Transporter MOVE OBJ) means that OBJ enables or facilitates the conveyance of what is transported (the animals, goods, people, etc. that are the Transportees) in the Transportation-Event MOVE.  OBJ itself is an Object-Moving in MOVE, so a catapult is not a Transporter because it doesn't come with its victims.  OBJ will generally hold, support, contain, etc. the Transportees throughout the MOVE event.  OBJ may or may not supply the motive force in the event MOVE; e.g., a child's wagon, a bicycle, a sleigh, and a paper bag can all be Transporters.  More examples are automobiles, wheelchairs, dogsleds, and parachutes.  Carrier pigeons are transporters when performing the function for which they were bred; a horse is a Transporter when it is being ridden but a Provider-Of-Motive-Force when pulling a cart or plow or sleigh.Some cautions and refinements, however: (i) although automobiles are Transporters, they should have the more specific role designation of Vehicle (q.v.) because they are also Self-Powered-Devices.   When your car is being towed by a towtruck, and you are riding along inside as it gets towed, then in that special case the car is just a Transporter (of you) and the towtruck is the Vehicle of that event.  (ii) Another more specific role designation for some Transporters -- those which are Physical-Devices -- is Device-Used (q.v.); e.g., the use of crutches in hobbling, ice skates in skating, and sneakers in walking.  See also the Comment on Transportation-Event.  (iii) The organism locomoting in a Locomotion-Event may be a Transporter if carrying something other than itself (Carrying-While-Locomoting qv.) .  In other cases an organism may be a Transportees, e.g. someone riding a bike or skating.  Note that the organism must be the Provider-Of-Motive-Force in these cases."))
