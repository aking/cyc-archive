DATA.  Note 14

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

No doubt everybody who's still awake sacrificed
the few spare moments of their sleep last night
that it took to Figure all this out already,
but just for the record here's what I got:

Computation Summary for g&lt;u, v&gt; = ((u, v))

Figure 1 shows how g = ((u, v)) expands over [u, v] to
yield the equivalent exclusive disjunction uv + (u)(v).

Figure 1.  g = ((u, v))

Figure 2 shows how Eg = ((u + du, v + dv)) expands over [u, v] as:

uv.((du, dv)) + u(v).(du, dv) + (u)v.(du, dv) + (u)(v).((du, dv))

Figure 2.  Eg = ((u + du, v + dv))

Figure 3 shows how Dg = g + Eg expands over [u, v] to give:
