John, Mark, &amp; All, ...

Let me redraw your attentions to an example that
I have been chortling joyously about since first
I entered these lists, if not sometime before it,
but I think that our animadversions on I&amp;M&amp;OPT's
may have served to prepare us to see some of the
finer nuances of this most deceptively practical
and simple example.

<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg00729.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg00729.html</A>
<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01224.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01224.html</A>

I cite an excerpt from this old thread, changing the names
of the sign relations involved to "L(A)" and "L(B)", so as
to reserve the letter "R" for the domain of real numbers.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~AUTOCITATION~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

&gt; You can start out by imagining that two people,
&gt; A and B, have a language that is restricted to
&gt; just their own proper names, "A" and "B", plus
&gt; first and second person pronouns, "I" and "you",
&gt; which will here be schematized as "i" and "u",
&gt; respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; To specify a sign relation one has to give three domains,
&gt; the Object, Sign, and Interpretant domains, schematized
&gt; here as O, S, and I, respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; For this example, let us consider the two sign relations,
&gt; L(A) and L(B), corresponding to the usages of the
&gt; two "interpreters", A and B, respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; [ Notation:
&gt; |
&gt; | I use "in" for "element of", and "c" for "subset of".
&gt; ]
&gt; 
&gt; We have the following:
&gt; 
&gt; L(A), L(B)  c  O x S x I,
&gt; 
&gt; O  =  {A, B},
&gt; 
&gt; S  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"},
&gt; 
&gt; I  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"}.
&gt; 
&gt; L(A) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; | Object  |  Sign   | Interp  |
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; |         |         |         |
&gt; |    A    |   "A"   |   "A"   |
&gt; |    A    |   "A"   |   "i"   |
&gt; |    A    |   "i"   |   "A"   |
&gt; |    A    |   "i"   |   "i"   |
&gt; |         |         |         |
&gt; |    B    |   "B"   |   "B"   |
&gt; |    B    |   "B"   |   "u"   |
&gt; |    B    |   "u"   |   "B"   |
&gt; |    B    |   "u"   |   "u"   |
&gt; |         |         |         |
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; L(B) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; | Object  |  Sign   | Interp  |
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; |         |         |         |
&gt; |    A    |   "A"   |   "A"   |
&gt; |    A    |   "A"   |   "u"   |
&gt; |    A    |   "u"   |   "A"   |
&gt; |    A    |   "u"   |   "u"   |
&gt; |         |         |         |
&gt; |    B    |   "B"   |   "B"   |
&gt; |    B    |   "B"   |   "i"   |
&gt; |    B    |   "i"   |   "B"   |
&gt; |    B    |   "i"   |   "i"   |
&gt; |         |         |         |
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt;
&gt; Following a usage of C.S. Peirce, the elements of a sign relation L,
&gt; that is, the ordered triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; in L, are known as
&gt; its "elementary sign relations".  (This is roughly Peirce's meaning.)
&gt; 
&gt; That is all there is to this kind of model of the sign relations in question.
&gt; Semiosis, the Movie, is another story altogether.  Angel, with his mind fixed
&gt; on Buffy, might have the following sequence of thoughts, suitably abbreviated,
&gt; pass through his mind:  "B", "B", "u", "B", "u", "u", "B", "u", ..., only one
&gt; of many possible reveries that are due to his obsessive repetition compulsion.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the most that we can say about the bearing of these
&gt; abstract sign relations on the concrete transits of semiosis?
&gt; Just this:  The sign relations for the interpreters A and B
&gt; constrain the transitions in their respective processes of
&gt; semiosis, but do not of necessity determine them uniquely.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~NOITATICOTUA~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

In various notes regarding the "Story of A and B",
I introduced the following ideas and observations:

For each interpreter J in {A, B}, the projection of L(J) on its SI space is
an "equivalence relation" (ER), that is, a symmetric, reflexive, transitive
2-adic relation on SxI = SxS.  Whenever any sign relation L is so nice as to
satisfy this condition, I call the ER a "semiotic equivalence relation" (SER).
As with any ER, there is an associated family of "equivalence classes" (EC's)
that are said to form an "equivalence partition" (EP) of the set in question,
all of which in this context I will naturally acronymize as SEC's and SEP's.

In each of the sign relations L(J) for J in {A, B} it happens that the
associated SEP "reconstitutes" or "reconstructs" within the so-called
"syntactic domain" S |_| I, in this case just S = I, the structure of
the object domain O = {A, B}.  This is normally a very nice property.
But do we really want to suggest that the common object of the signs
in a SEC can be theoretically eliminated in favor of that very SEC?
I do not think that A and B would think so!  At any rate, the SEC's
that represent the objects A and B are not the same for L(A) &amp; L(B).

To Be Continued ...
