Michael,
   While I do believe that creating a single upper ontology is the right 
way to proceed, I'd agree it's a hypothesis to be tested.  For those who 
feel this goal is unreasonable but see the value in a catalog of theories, 
our actual work can be nearly identical.  Pick some concept from the Merged 
Ontology, or propose a new concept and start creating axioms that define 
distinctions you consider important.  Those who believe in a single upper 
ontology can try to merge the resultant theory with others.  Those who 
don't can still maintain the identity of the theory as a separate 
document.  The key is for folks actually to start work on formal ontologies 
instead of just asserting various notions.  An equally practical approach 
can be taken to resolve the upper vs middle vs lower ontology 
debate.  Those folks who believe in middle and lower ontology (whatever the 
definition for such may be) can propose such ontologies.  People who are 
interested in upper ontology can try to merge the lower ontologies with the 
upper ontology and see what influence results from missing higher level 
concepts.

&gt;I could not agree more with Nicola's comment regarding the conduct of the 
&gt;SUO list. I disagree with Jim that "Our problem has been lack of something 
&gt;to focus on."  Oh contrairre. There are countless worthy issues to focus 
&gt;on. The lack of progress, as Nicola suggests is due to the general 
&gt;unwillingness of the group to focus on a few issues at a time, to make and 
&gt;record progress, etc. And of course, not to stray willy nilly into topics 
&gt;of little relevance. There was a perfect opportunity to record progress by 
&gt;having papers submitted to SUO - this was not taken up. I am not pointing 
&gt;blame anywhere, for I also failed to contribute a paper, due to other 
&gt;priorities.  I regret that the signal to noise ratio does not allow me to 
&gt;participate as I would like to. I regret missing out on some of the truly 
&gt;excellent discussions from which I learn a lot, most particularly due to 
&gt;Pat Hayes' prolific contributions.
&gt;
&gt;While I am on a roll...  I also tend to agree with many of the points 
&gt;Pat  has made recently, which unfortunately point to the apparent fact 
&gt;that there is no compelling evidence that a STANDARD UO will be of value. 
&gt;I'm not even sure of the value of any UO, in most contexts. I heartily 
&gt;agree that starting from the top is not a good way to get a USEFUL 
&gt;ontology, as I have argued many times.  Our experience in applying the 
&gt;enterprise ontology (which from the perspective of our application, was a 
&gt;very abstract Upperish Level Ontology for enterprise concepts) was that 
&gt;there was only one case where it was even possible to connect to concepts 
&gt;in the EO, and there was no real benefit in doing this. There is a huge 
&gt;gaping gulf between application-specific ontologies and upper level ones, 
&gt;and it is not only difficult to bridge the gap, there seems to be no point 
&gt;in doing so.  I agree with Pat that one needs to start in the MIDDLE where 
&gt;the real action is, in one's given domain. Then, !
&gt;on!
&gt;!
&gt;  a demand-pull basis, add upperish-level concepts as they are required.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, I am not so confident as Pat that the whole effort is a 
&gt;waste, and doomed to fail. Having a SINGLE upper ontology, may well fail, 
&gt;but having components to choose from may well be useful. I still have a 
&gt;sense that the way to proceed is as follows for a given domain, at 
&gt;whatever level.
&gt;1. Identify important concepts.
&gt;2. identify different ways to model them
&gt;3. Split the differences into two categories:
&gt;a. Those that are superficial, and are mere choices with minimal 
&gt;consequence, all may have the same models, for example.
&gt;b. Those that are IMPORTANT - such as those identified by Pat in his 
&gt;survey of time representations.
&gt;
&gt;4. For the non-important differences, choose one that seems to work,even 
&gt;if it is arbitrary. Anyone who does not like it, can choose to use their 
&gt;own, and map to/from it.
&gt;5. For the important ones, develop independent and presumably incompatible 
&gt;theories which one can choose from.
&gt;
&gt;None of this is necessarily new, having been said by various folk in 
&gt;varous ways.
&gt;
&gt;I will stop this less than well-articulated ramble...

&gt;
&gt;Nicola,
&gt;
&gt;         The message volume has not been the cause of our lack of progress,
&gt;it has just filled the void.  Our problem has been lack of something to
&gt;focus on.  Only one starter document has been proposed and the group did not
&gt;accept it (though it did pass in a straw poll).
&gt;
&gt;         Others have posted work, as you have, but have not been willing to
&gt;actually propose it as a group effort, probably because they didn't have the
&gt;time or resources to champion it any further.  This is understandable, but a
&gt;standard will only be developed if it has a core group willing to champion
&gt;it all the way.
&gt;
&gt;         Unless we have this key ingredient, no measure of good management
&gt;will lead this group to success.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; &gt;Nicola,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       Have you given any further thought to submitting any of your work as
&gt; &gt;a starter document for SUO.  As you know, the group needs one or more
&gt; &gt;documents to focus its efforts on.
&gt;
&gt;Dear James,
&gt;
&gt;         The paper we have submitted to the IJCAI SUO Workshop (which
&gt;will be presented at the IJCAI ws on ontologies) cannot be intended
&gt;as a starter ontology, but can certainly be considered among the
&gt;starter documents. There is no attempt to be complete, though. A
&gt;preliminary version of our IKF reference ontology is scheduled by the
&gt;end of this year, and we should able to announce a  preliminary
&gt;top-level before Summer.
&gt;
&gt;         A further (indirect) contribution is my recent review of
&gt;Sowa's book and especially his top-level ontology. Since the current
&gt;merged ontology is based on it, this is implicitly a criticism to the
&gt;merged ontology. I have no time for an open, endless discussion on
&gt;this, but I will certainly welcome specific, focused observations.
&gt;
&gt;         In the meanwhile, our own contribution to the SUO initiative
&gt;will necessarily be very limited, mainly because of the fact that
&gt;this group hasn't been able to implement a strict issue-based
&gt;discussion methodology, nor the "bookshelf of results" proposed in
&gt;the past by Mike Uschold and myself. To me, the inhability of
&gt;achieving this and the lack of control of out-of-focus discussions on
&gt;the list reveals a serious failure of this initiative. This is also
&gt;the reason of my abstension regarding the Chair elections.
&gt;
&gt;         A further reason of disappointment is the way the IEEE SUO
&gt;workshop has been managed. Still I don't know how many papers have
&gt;been submitted and selected. I suspect that ours was the only paper.
&gt;This could have been a useful opportunity to force people to condense
&gt;their proposals in papers, but apparently it didn't work.
&gt;
&gt;         That's it, for now. I will be more active when this list will
&gt;be more efficient, and when a list of issues and proposals, with
&gt;defenders and opponents for each of them, will be posted on the Web
&gt;site. I know it is difficult, but it is the only way to proceed.
&gt;
&gt;Best wishes,
&gt;
&gt;-- Nicola
&gt;
&gt;P.S.: I am answering to you only since you sent me a personal
&gt;message; I encourage you to forward this to the whole list, however.
