&gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We ought to be very careful about identifying mutually exclusive
&gt; &gt; options, especially, very wary of POV's that present themselves as
&gt; &gt; Either-Or's whenever it is conceivable they merely gloss different
&gt; &gt; facets of the same object, subject, topic, or whatever, as this has
&gt; &gt; been one of the places, historically and hysterically speaking, where
&gt; &gt; we have wasted the most time, that is, assuming that at least some of
&gt; &gt; it could have been avoided, which is a good question for such as us.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  A good point worth clarifying.  In my view a choice
&gt;      is required just when failure to make a choice leads to
&gt;      a logical contradiction, and that is the test I would be
&gt;      looking for (at least as a starting position).  Choices
&gt;      of course only apply within a particular point of view.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt;
&gt; Matthew

Matthew,

Again, we have to be extremely careful, because all of these POV's
have been well "worked over" in point of time and history, and those
who seek a distinctive position are well-schooled in all of the ways
to "sharpen up" a position to the point where, in its unnaturally
idealized, idolized, idle-ized, idyllized form, it may appear to
involve a contradiction with what are really its complementary
and its supplementary positions.  I guess that I will always
return to the days when I had to work through the fuss over
particles versus waves, since this was the mess that most
impressed me when I first had to make my eigen-transition
from the classical way of thinking, that had been burned
into my impressionable brain by my high school teachers,
to the "relativistic and quantum mechanical" (RAQM) way
that I had to learn as a fresh-person at the university.
What I discovered, after much distraction and grief and
the long dark night of the soul, was that the RAQM way
of thought had really been my natural way of thinking
all along, that is, before my grammar school teachers
had burned it out of my brain, and I promised myself
then and there that I would never go humbly again --
that is to say, to so docily surrender my whole way
of being and living and thinking to whatever form
of authoritarian dogma that somebody judged was
the right grade of pablum to be parceling out
to me at a given age and estimated station.

So There!

Jon Awbrey
