I meant by mind-less :&nbsp;with no explicit reference to a mind. The L75
definition of a sign is mind-less in the way that the definition of a line
is particle-less ("A definition of a sign will be given which not more
refers to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place
with a particle occupies, part by part, during a lapse of time." ) But
is there anything new here really ?

I know. Formal definitions do not explain, but formal models do. However
formal models directly derived from formal definitions do not explain more
than the definition themselves if they do not add anything to it.

<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<p>> The formal definition from L75 only describes the sign
<br>> as one of the correlates of a triadic relation, i.e.
<br>> the sign as a being for an other.
<p>I do not talk this way.&nbsp; You just think this way.
<br>I have said over [and over]* that the significance
<br>of this particular definition is the way that it most
<br>clearly defines the whole sign relation as the primary
<br>subject of the definition, a relation in extension being
<br>a set of triples of the form &lt;o, s, i>, etc, etc, etc.
<p>> But a sign has in fact two beings:
<br>> its being for an other (the object)
<br>> and its own being.
<p>And every father is a son, except possibly for the boundary
<br>conditions at the beginning and the end of time.&nbsp; So what?</blockquote>
Well it is what I thought:&nbsp;you are reducing the sign to the "sign
relation" and everything get so relative that you do not know where to
begin. If the sign is destroyed, the sign relation is destroyed, but conversely
if the sign relation is destroyed a part of the being of the sign subsists
because its being is twofold, what is left is a potential sign or an object
of experience that is not a sign of anything (being a representative does
not mean only being a representative.)
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<br>> It is not an isolated entity because it belongs to a genuine triad,
<br>> but nevertheless its entire being is not completely swallowed by
<br>> the triadic relation either.
<p>The entire being?&nbsp; This is absolute essentialism again.
<br>Being a sign at a particular moment is only one aspect
<br>or the hypothetical "totality" of being of any entity.
<br>Being a sign is a role of a being, not its essence.
<br>Doesn't anybody just read anymore?
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
The nature of the sign is to exist in replicas (Cf. New Elements).
<blockquote>In the first place, a sign is not a real thing. It is of such
a nature as to exist in replicas. Look down a printed page, and every 'the'
you see is the same word, every 'e' the same letter. A real thing does
not so exist in replica. The being of a sign is merely being represented.
Now really being and being represented are very different.</blockquote>
What is usually call the "sign" is only the replica of it, by forgetting
that signs are more than their replica. But what is a sign without replica?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<br>> If the three elements (S, O, I) are of the nature of a sign, ...
<p>This becomes non-sense at this point.</blockquote>
Well, being of the nature of a sign does not mean to be a sign. The nature
of a sign --- as an element of a genuine triadic relation --- is the same
as the nature of the object and of the interpretant. In the Lowell Lectures:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>537. <b>Now in genuine Thirdness, the first, the second, and
the third are all three of the nature of thirds,</b> <b>or thought</b>,
while in respect to one another they are first, second, and third. he first
is thought in its capacity as mere possibility; that is, mere mind capable
of thinking, or a mere vague idea. The second is thought playing the role
of a Secondness, or event. That is, it is of the general nature of experience
or information. The third is thought in its role as governing Secondness.
It brings the information into the mind, or determines the idea and gives
it body. It is informing thought, or cognition. But take away the psychological
or accidental human element, and in this genuine Thirdness we see the operation
of a sign.</blockquote>
So in relation to the triad as a whole, they are of the same nature, of
the nature of thought, but respective to each other and according to their
role in the relation they have distinctive modes of being, their nature
is both different and identical at the same time depending on how you look
at it.
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<br>> in that they take part in a triadic relation (Peirce writes
<br>> in the Lowell Lectures that they are of the nature of "thirds" ),
<br>> likewise, they have their own being, the interpretant has its own
<br>> being, the sign has its own being and the object has its own being.
<p>All God's Chillun Got Their Own Being ...
<br>That has little to do with being signs.
<p>> So if you start from a formal definition that only refer
<br>> to a triadic relation and believe that you can explain ...
<p>It's not an explanation --
<br>It's only a description --
<br>Please!&nbsp; No wagering!
<p>> everything from there, where each element is reduced to its mode of
<br>> being respective to the other correlates, then you are missing half
<br>> of the picture.&nbsp; In asking "what is a sign?", do not simply
answer
<br>> the question by saying how a sign enters in relation with the other
<br>> correlates, but ask yourself also what a sign in actu really is,
<br>> what is "an object of direct experience" like? and the object of
<br>> the sign:&nbsp; what is a "fragment of history" like? and finally
what
<br>> is the interpretant, what is the determination of a mind?&nbsp; Or
you
<br>> have only walked half the road.
<p>I do not think that you get what formal models are for.
<br>They are not intent to exhaust the being or even meant
<br>to exhaust the description of any real thing.&nbsp; At best,
<br>they capture something of importance about that thing,
<br>enough to get by for a while.&nbsp; There does not have to
<br>be any confounded kind of gawd-aweful death-struggle
<br>between formal and practical.&nbsp; The choice of a formal
<br>model is a practical decision.&nbsp; Formal is beautiful
<br>and beautiful is practical, like I done tole you.
<p>Jon Awbrey</blockquote>
Yes, but if a formal model is too all-encompassing,&nbsp; as a result of
which some things become sign which otherwise would not have been signs
practically, its usefulness is limited to theoretical speculations detached
from reality.
