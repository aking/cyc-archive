  posted documents), if they wanted to the WG to commense work on it.&nbsp; They 
  said YES.</FONT></SPAN>

  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>Fair 
  criticism.&nbsp; In the future, we'll&nbsp;discuss a vote before taking it, 
  even straw polls.&nbsp;But this is no grounds for reversing things.&nbsp; This 
  was an unofficial straw poll that did not count.&nbsp; It only provided input 
  to the 'Proposed Conclusions.'&nbsp; The Proposed Conclusions were adopted 
  because only two people&nbsp;objected to them.&nbsp; The alternative is to 
  propose another vote, which nobody is calling for.</FONT></SPAN> 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001>&gt;&nbsp;</SPAN>Normally in this sort of 
  group, votes are used to formalize a consensus that has already been 
  reached.&nbsp;<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial

  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT color=#0000ff 
  size=3>Not so.&nbsp; Maximum consensus is the goal for a given document, 
  because you want it to meet most user's needs and need 75% approval in Sponsor 
  Ballot.&nbsp; When bringing a document into a WG, a simple majority vote is 
  the norm.</FONT>&nbsp; </FONT></SPAN>

  size=2>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>2)&nbsp; The vote met resistance from the 
  group and the chair then characterized it as a "straw vote" with no official 
  status. 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT color=#0000ff><FONT face=Arial>Not 
  so.&nbsp; The original call for a vote stated: "</FONT><FONT face=Arial>Since 
  we are still in the process of establishing official voting rights,</FONT> 
  <FONT face=Arial>I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw

  several occasions (when objections on other issues were&nbsp;<SPAN 
  class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>raised) 
  that&nbsp;<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>there&nbsp;<SPAN 
  class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial

  an IEEE Working Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT 
  face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>After the vote&nbsp;<SPAN 
  class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>was taken 
  and the results announced, the chair - when challenged - stated 
  that&nbsp;<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>Robert's Rules are the method for vote counting in 
  a IEEE WG.&nbsp;<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN> 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial><FONT color=#0000ff>Most 
  IEEE working groups eventually need to establish their own Policies and 
  Procedures to meet their own special needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;SUO will need to do the 
  same, as we have already started to do (e.g. establishing voting 
  rights)&nbsp;&nbsp; I never&nbsp;used RRO to declare official results, because 
  I never declare official results from the vote.&nbsp; I simply referred to RRO 
  in drafting&nbsp;Proposed Conclusions.&nbsp; If there were many objections, we 
  would have scrapped the vote and started over.&nbsp; There were only two, so 
  we are proceeding.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>4)&nbsp; It is obvious that many of the 
  processes in Robert's Rules were not observed.&nbsp;<SPAN 
  class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN> 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT color=#0000ff>&nbsp;<FONT 
  face=Arial>But it was just a straw poll.&nbsp;We are not proceeding because we 
  have declared the vote official.&nbsp; We are proceeding based on the Proposed 
  Conclusions, which only two people have objected to.&nbsp;&nbsp;If eough 
  people want a truly official vote, we can now conduct one, but I have not 
  heard a single person call for this.</FONT></FONT></SPAN> 
  <P>5)&nbsp; The vote (YES = 11, NO = 9, ABSTAIN = 4) shows a very divided 
  group.&nbsp; At best a thin majority of YES vs NO, and clearly not a majority 
  of all the votes cast - certainly not a majority of those eligible to vote 
  (50% majority, not the 75% super majority frequently required in standards 
  work).<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN> 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>The Proposed 
  Conclusions acknowledge this was a thin 
  majority.</FONT>&nbsp;</SPAN>&nbsp;<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT

  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>6)&nbsp; On the basis of a "thin 
  majority" in a "straw poll"&nbsp; the chair announces his official "Proposed 
  Conclusions and Actions from Vote" - subject, of course,&nbsp; to there being 
  no objections to his proposals.&nbsp; When multiple objections were stated, 
  the chair deemed them to be too few to warrant a change in his proposed 
  actions. 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>The&nbsp;did 
  not announce official Proposed conclusions.&nbsp; It was nothing more than a 
  proposal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Asking for any objections does not mean that any 
  specific number of objections is enough to prevent things.&nbsp; I believe two 
  objections, given 24 votes, is not enough to&nbsp;discard the Proposed 
  Conclusions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I would be doing wrong by allowing 2 
  objections to prevent moving forward.</FONT></SPAN> 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001>&nbsp;&gt;</SPAN>a)&nbsp; The chair has 
  abused the process.&nbsp; This creates division and lack of trust within the

  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT color=#0000ff 
  size=3>I'm doing nothing more than trying to move things forward within the 
  rules and medium available.&nbsp; Also, some newcomers to standards groups are 
  shocked that divisions occur, and&nbsp;when they sometimes&nbsp;get 
  contentious.&nbsp;Well, this is the nature of the standards 
  process.</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></SPAN>

  no actions may proceed from it.&nbsp;<SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT

  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>The straw 
  poll was never presented as an official vote, though it was called 
  a&nbsp;vote.&nbsp; No action was declared from it, only a 
  proposal.</FONT>&nbsp;</SPAN>

  should not be taken in standards groups unless a broad consensus has 
  developed.&nbsp; Only things (usually administrative) that must be decided 
  immediately should be put to a vote without such a consensus.&nbsp; It is 
  normally the role of the chair to facilitate consensus - not division. 
  <P><SPAN class=216533413-01032001><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>There are 
  several other SUO members considering submitting documents for this&nbsp;WG to 
  commense work on.&nbsp; You seem to suggest we would need to be assured of 
  broad consensus before even permitting&nbsp;the vote.&nbsp; I would guess many 
  members&nbsp;might not pay attention to a document&nbsp;until it is proposed 
  in a vote (which Ian faced).&nbsp; There are techniques under RRO for 
  preventing a vote (e.g.Move to Table), but I hope things don't degenerate to 
  that level.&nbsp; Otherwise, if there is a 'second,' I think any motions could 
  be put to a vote.&nbsp; Of course, we'll seek maximum consensus, but majority 
  must rule.</FONT></SPAN><SPAN class=216533413-01032001>&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
