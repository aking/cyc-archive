Adam Pease &lt;apease@ks.teknowledge.com&gt;:
&gt;Pat,
&gt;  You state that causality should be prohibited from "unreal" to 
&gt;"real" and vice versa.  Although I can see that the unreal-to-real 
&gt;case should be prohibited, I don't think the other direction should 
&gt;be strictly insulated.  For example, it might make sense to assert 
&gt;information about "Adam's younger brother" (which doesn't exist) in 
&gt;an "unreal" world (or context), but if there is no Adam in the real 
&gt;world there is an effect on the unreal world which is that extra 
&gt;content (the existence of Adam) is required to be in the unreal 
&gt;world.

I see what you mean, but I would say that this is best described by 
putting the real you (or maybe a facsimile or counterpart of the real 
you) into the imaginary world as well as in the real one. A causal 
influence between worlds (in any direction) would be something more 
like a ghostly visitation or a paranormal event in the world where 
the caused thing happened, since that would be an effect from a cause 
in another world.

I suspect we agree on this, and I just didnt explain myself adequately before ?

Pat

&gt;  This is a pretty esoteric quibble though and I agree with your main point.

&gt;&gt;Phil, I won't say anything else about what we call T, but you do 
&gt;&gt;raise an  important issue, which can be summarized as the question 
&gt;&gt;of whether existence should be a predicate. There is a potential 
&gt;&gt;mismatch between 'exists' meaning actual existence in the real 
&gt;&gt;world and 'exists' used as a quantifier in the logic. If we want 
&gt;&gt;our logic to be able to reason about circumstances which might 
&gt;&gt;never actually obtain (as is often done in planning. by considering 
&gt;&gt;alternative possible futures, then deciding to perform actions 
&gt;&gt;which make some of them impossible; and as is also done in 
&gt;&gt;counterfactual reasoning), then we have to allow into the domain of 
&gt;&gt;quantification things which do not in fact exist in the first 
&gt;&gt;sense, and also be able to contemplate things which do exist having 
&gt;&gt;properties which they never in fact have. So just saying
&gt;&gt;(exists (?x)(= ?x a))
&gt;&gt;wouldnt be enough to assert that the thing called 'a' *really* 
&gt;&gt;exists; to do that one would need to say something more about this 
&gt;&gt;thing called 'a'. Exactly what more is an engineering question 
&gt;&gt;which we need to address.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A common strategy is to introduce 'imaginary entities' or 
&gt;&gt;'possibilia' as a distinct category in the classification 
&gt;&gt;heirarchy, but I would argue that this is a mistake, on several 
&gt;&gt;grounds. First, any kind of thing might be possible: one can have 
&gt;&gt;possible humans, possible events, possible worlds, etc.., so as a 
&gt;&gt;category this cuts across the entire classification spectrum. 
&gt;&gt;Second, it suggests that possible-but-unreal things are somehow 
&gt;&gt;another category of real things, much as birds are a kind of 
&gt;&gt;organism. This gives rise to many well-known concpetual puzzles and 
&gt;&gt;paradoxes, all arising from a basic misunderstanding. (Quine in a 
&gt;&gt;famous passage points out the error in going from 'it is possible 
&gt;&gt;that someone could have been standing in the empty doorway' to 
&gt;&gt;'there is a possible person standing in the empty doorway', by 
&gt;&gt;asking *how many* possible but non-actual people every empty 
&gt;&gt;doorway has to contain?) And third, it masks the important point 
&gt;&gt;that these non-actual things almost always seem to be 'inside' 
&gt;&gt;non-actual worlds, ie we talk about an alternative set of 
&gt;&gt;circumstances or alternative possible worlds (in which, say, I had 
&gt;&gt;a brother who I don't in fact have), rather than putting the 
&gt;&gt;possible but non-actual things into this real world. And there is a 
&gt;&gt;good reason for this: if the possible-but-non-actual things were in 
&gt;&gt;fact actual, they would have real effects on the rest of the world. 
&gt;&gt;One cannot just insert a thing into the world and expect everything 
&gt;&gt;else to go on just as before; so one is forced into thinking about 
&gt;&gt;a wider set of circumstances than just the immediate surroundings 
&gt;&gt;of the imaginary thing. As we all know, one dead sparrow might have 
&gt;&gt;all kinds of repercussions, so it is usually safest to provide an 
&gt;&gt;alternative world for the sparrow to die in, and see what happens 
&gt;&gt;there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think that a general-purpose SUO needs to allow non-actual 
&gt;&gt;entities - it cannot presume that the existential quantifier means 
&gt;&gt;existence in the real world - but that just allowing them casually, 
&gt;&gt;as it were, without some attention being given to their effects, is 
&gt;&gt;a well-known recipe for conceptual muddle. I would suggest that any 
&gt;&gt;nonreal thing needs to be thought of as enclosed within a non-real 
&gt;&gt;causal bubble which is large enough to provide a causal 'horizon' 
&gt;&gt;insulating any effects of the unreal thing from influencing any 
&gt;&gt;events in the real world, or vice versa. The safest such bubble 
&gt;&gt;would be an entire possible world, but we might allow somewhat 
&gt;&gt;smaller sets of circumstances or 4-d enclosing space-times to play 
&gt;&gt;the same role. Then the way to introduce 'possibilia' into the 
&gt;&gt;ontology is to introduce these 'bubbles', and allow 'IsReal' as a 
&gt;&gt;predicate on them (which asserts that that set of circumstances 
&gt;&gt;does in fact obtain in the real world somewhere/when). Then a 
&gt;&gt;possible-but-not-real person (eg my imaginary brother) is simply a 
&gt;&gt;normal person who has the misfortune to only be enclosed inside 
&gt;&gt;nonreal bubbles. This overall picture has no need for a special 
&gt;&gt;category of 'possibilia', therefore, and it is meaningless to even 
&gt;&gt;talk about possible-but-unreal things inside real worlds.
