&gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Finding myself with a spare half hour,
&gt; &gt; I will try to see if I can address some
&gt; &gt; of the remaining points in your last note.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  One reason I am pursuing this discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      is that if there really are things it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      cannot handle, I would really like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      to know.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I always take people at their word,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I take you really to want to know:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The POV that you have been exposing here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information contained in their apt expressions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The "Pat Hayes Universal Change Of Variables Formula" (PHUCOVF)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that nobody ever meant to say what some people once pretended
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it said, as have you also in regard to a co-indited point.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      Pat's proof, but I am not sufficiently versed in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      these things to be sure that you are not employing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      the same kinds of tricks that you claim Pat has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      employed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, at least we agree that some form of distracting
&gt; &gt; prestidigitation is involved, and it remains but to
&gt; &gt; see who is raveling up their sleeve and who is trying
&gt; &gt; to dispell the spell of this sleight transliteration.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I only see claims of such so far.

Yes, but I must wait to see what clouds of ink Pat will next
dis-peirce all about us to dim the light I have of late cast
upon the subject.  (Without rhetoric, how shall I then live?)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I'm afraid that is not an arguement that will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; convince me on its own.  If you wish to do that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you will have to present a specific example of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where the information in some triadic relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot be transformed into some set of binary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relations.  If you provide the triadic relation,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will provide the binary relations from which the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; triadic relation can be constructed (or not and admit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are right).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Once again, I have provided you not only with specific definitions
&gt; &gt; of the two most common forms of reduction that are usually met with
&gt; &gt; in this context, but I have given many examples of 3-adic relations,
&gt; &gt; indicating how they fall out with respect to these two typical FOA's.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  and for these types of reduction I agree with you.
&gt;      But you do not describe what I do (and countless
&gt;      people working in database land do daily).

Don't make me say it -- Been there, done that, etc.
I am sad to say that I know whereof I speak here.

&gt; &gt; I have now contributed to this working group what approaches a small
&gt; &gt; monograph on this topic, and I have just condensed and edited these
&gt; &gt; notes into a single essay on the "Reductions Among Relations" thread.
&gt; &gt; So far, nobody else has even defined another type of decomposition --
&gt; &gt; I do not yet recognize the "transliteration" that Pat put forth as
&gt; &gt; being up to the mark on that score -- and nobody else has provided
&gt; &gt; any extensional examples of relations, which most people who look
&gt; &gt; into it long enough find are best when it comes to settling these
&gt; &gt; sorts of questions in any concrete and definitive way.  If people
&gt; &gt; prefer to continue with intensional examples then it is incumbent
&gt; &gt; on them to provide explicit definitions of these relations, but
&gt; &gt; so far I have just not seen any being 'given' for the 'taking',
&gt; &gt; if you will.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  OK well let me first try to state a method,
&gt;      you will have to forgive some lack of formality,

If it can be formalized, I will help you to formalize it.

&gt;      but it should not be so unclear what I mean.
&gt;      Where I come from this method would be
&gt;      informally known as reification.

Gasp!

&gt; Purpose:
&gt; 
&gt; To take any n-adic relation occurence and turn it
&gt; into n binary relations without loss of meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; Method:
&gt; 
&gt; Create an object (say x) that stands
&gt; for the n-adic relation as a whole.

Is x what we would call a "relation name"?
It is the phrase "stands for" that makes
me think this.  If not, why not just say
that x is an n-adic relation?  When you
say "relation as a whole" do you mean
a set of n-tuples?  If so, can we then
say that x is a set of n-tuples?

&gt; Take each each element in the relation occurance

Is what you call a "relation occurrence"
the same thing as a "relation instance",
that is, an n-tuple?  Or is it the x?

&gt; and create a relation between it and x.

Okay, I am guessing then that "relation occurrence" means "n-tuple".
But then what do you mean by "each element in the relation occurrence"?
Do you mean "each component of the n-tuple"?

I am stuck at this point, and will need to wait for clarification.

Jon Awbrey

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

&gt; Use the role that the element plays
&gt; in the original relation to name
&gt; this binary relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Example:
&gt; 
&gt; (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary Book1)
&gt;      (and (gives x)
&gt;           (giver John)
&gt;           (receiver Mary)
&gt;           (given book1)
&gt;      )
&gt; )
&gt; 
&gt; (probably flakey, but I hope intelligible.)
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt;       Matthew
