Adam, greetings. You are making a central mistake here. Axioms do not comprise content. We don't have ANY content until we know what an axiomatic ontology claims to be about. First we have to determine what the content of an ontology actually IS.  Once we have that reasonably clear, we can make a start on trying to integrate two of them.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
To paraphrase a famous comment "What is your meaning of is?"  Are you talking about a model theory for axioms?  That doesn't seem relevant to me.  I don't think there's a mistake.  The terms and axioms are the standard.  What is the content you want?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
The intended meaning of the axioms.  Read all the documentation strings in the document and ask yourself if they make sense, or form a coherent picture of the world, or a coherent framework for describing it. If the axioms ARE the standard then we can just write axioms at random and call it an SUO. (Why not? if the axioms are the standard then one set of axioms has just as much right to be considered a standard as any other set.)<BR>
<BR>
(As an aside, I disagree with you profoundly about the relavance of model theory: without a model theory (for the language), the axioms literally don't mean anything. But there is a model theory, so we don't have to get bent out of shape about this.)<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>Look at the ontologies which Niles has cobbled together here, and ask what they are supposed to be about. There is the Casarti/Varzi ontology of 'holes', whose axioms contain quantifiers which are intended to range over a certain subclass of pieces of space (those which can be thought of as holes in some other, physical, object). Then there is the overarching Entire Theory of the Universe represented by John Sowa's upper-level ontology classification. Evidently, when one of John's axioms uses a 'forall', it doesnt mean the same as what one of C&amp;V's axioms mean when it uses a 'forall'; John's universal quantifier ranges over a much, much larger set of things than the C&amp;V universal quantifers do. Its not even clear to me that the range of the C&amp;V quantifiers can be characterised within the classification scheme which Niles has extracted from John, in fact . (I'm sure that there are several Sowa-classs into which the C&amp;V-quantifications can be placed, but I am not at all sure there is one that fits them exactly, which is what we need in order to put a suitable restriction onto the quantifiers in the C&amp;V axioms.) Every 'source' from which Niles has lifted axioms has a distinct notion of what is in its universe, and the axioms were written with that universe in  mind. That is what I meant by saying that the various parts of Niles' axiom-collection have incompatible assumptions. When you move a universal quantifer from one universe to another, the likelihood of its remaining true is vanishingly small.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
I did a cursory look at the axioms and they all seem to have restrictions on the variables so there doesn't seem to any danger that axioms from different sources are quantifying over the same classes or instances (where each might have assumed a different "universe").  As an abstract concern this makes sense, but for us to declare this a problem, I think you'd need to identify two axioms that have an actual compatibility problem.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
You must have taken a very cursory look. None of the mereological axioms have any such restrictions at all, for example. Remember, this is all supposed to be written in SUO-KIF, which (as I'm sure you will recall) is *not* a sorted or typed language, so any quantifier restrictions need to be explicitly stated in the axioms. (Neil is using an axiomatic style which is reminiscent of MELD, but in the SUO-KIF core one cannot rely on domain-restriction assertions to automatically restrict any other quantifiers. Since you argued so long and with such passion against the introduction of sorting into the SUO-KIF core, surely you are not assuming that it is being used here?)<BR>
<BR>
Even if I am more liberal, and interpret these axioms as really being written in a kind of MELD-style sorted extension of KIF (a bad idea, but leave that as an aside), there are still some oddities. For example, the basic mereological relation  <I>part-of</I> used in these axioms is typed using Sowa's ideas of part/whole, which are based on the idea of a part as a 'component'rather than a mereological 'piece', which is the sense required in theSmith/C&amp;V axioms (I quote from the document:<BR>
"<FONT face="Courier_New">(documentation part-of "(part-of ?PART ?WHOLE) implies that the existence of ?PART is independent of the existence of ?WHOLE.")<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>later<FONT face="Courier_New">:<BR>
<BR>
"(&lt;=> <BR>
(superficial-part-of ?x ?y)<BR>
(and <BR>
(part-of ?x ?y)<BR>
(not<BR>
(exists (?z)<BR>
(interior-part-of ?z ?x)))))<BR>
<BR>
(documentation superficial-part-of "?x is a superficial part of ?y iff ?x is a part of ?y that has no interior parts of its own (or, intuitively, that only overlaps those parts of y that are externally connected with the geometric complement of y). This too is a transitive relation closed under sum-of and prod-of.")<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>So a superficial part has no interior - it is a 'piece of skin', intuitively, or better a 'piece of surface' of something - but its existence must be independent of the existence of the object it is a surface of?<BR>
<BR>
I found this is about a minute. How many more problems like this are there? It seems to me that the burden is on Niles to come up with a coherent account of the overall ontological framework he is supposing to underlie all this stuff, rather than on us to come up with concerete problems. Problems like this are rampant, and must inevitably be with any document put together in this way. <BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>It's easy to say that any proposal is inadequate.  My hope is that you and others with propose specific improvements.  Ian has done considerably more than just merge sources into a common notation.<BR>
Certainly, different ontologies may not have strong connections with one another.  I don't believe that is required.  Every branch of a tree need not be strongly connected to a large set of siblings. The important features I would say are that the branches are not inconsistent or redundant.  I believe that has been achieved.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
I am absolutely certain that it has not. I am not talking about branches of a tree; that is beside the point (and also, incidentally, misunderstands the nature of Sowa'a classification scheme, which is lattice-based rather than tree-like.) My point (which Ive already made to Niles) is that every time one adjoins an axiom from one ontology into another ontology, you have to carefully re-think exactly what every quantifier means, and ask youself whether, and if so how, the intended meaning of the quantification can be stated in the larger, merged, ontology. You also need to ask youself what all the relation names mean and now they need to be translated into the other terminology. Sometimes they might, if you are remarkably lucky, translate into relations there as well. More likely they will have to be rendered as quantified restrictions on other relations, so that (R A B) might have to be translated as something like<BR>
(exists (?y)(and(implies (phi ?y) (R1 A ?y)) (implies (rho ?y)(R2  B ?y)) )), where rho and phi are themselves complex assertions. This means that a simple universal quantification becomes an nested quantifier statement which will generate new nonlogical vocabulary when skolemised, and there is good chance that you will need new axioms for those skolem functions when you start thinking about what they mean. We found that even in translating between alternative axiom systems for mereotopology that there were cases where a simple relational assertion became a triply nested quantification scheme, and a two-line axiom translated into expressions with five nested alternating quantifiers, just because one world view only quantified over regular sets, and the other allowed surface and edge fragments to be first-class entities.  God alone knows what would have happened if there had been things like nexuses and abstracta and firstnesses in the universe as well.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Well, again, if there's a concrete problem of this sort that we can identify, let's address it.  But let's not throw out the whole ontology just because this sort of problem *might* exist.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
They almost certainly exist. To expect them not to exist is like expecting that random stones will magically fit together, or that random pieces of code will automatically interface with each other. What worries me most is that you and Niles don't even seem to be aware that there is an issue here that needs to be addressed.<BR>
<BR>
(For another example, the document is confused about time-points. It says that nothing can happen at a timepoint (arguable: how about an instantaneous flash, or the time when a tossed ball has zero vertical velocity?)and that it is meaningless to ask how long a timepoint lasts (wrong: it is meaningful, and the answer is zero). More seriously, it (or Niles) needs to get clear whether it thinks of time-intervals as being identical with sets of timepoints (in which case the Allen relation <I>meets</I> is very peculiar), or not, and if not then what the relationship is. <BR>
<BR>
By the way, who said anything about throwing anything out? If Jim hadn't raised this wierd spectre of voting about every change to the document and it being possible to cast it into standards words, we would all be getting along swimmingly.  As is often the case, the managers seem to be there just to cause trouble. <BR>
