It seems to me that the mention of differential forms in this context
is a trope rather than an element of an analogy.   But I'd certainly be
interested to
find out if I'm missing something.

On the other hand, the program to understanding the relationships and
transformations between ontologies is interesting.  Perhaps category theory
is the field on which this battle should be fought.

Subject:  ONT Analytic Differential Ontology (ADO)



¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

FOOturists,

Questions that have arisen lately, on the themes of development,
differentiation, and diversity among our ontologies, not to mention
disagreement, dispersion, and discord among our perspectives on them,
lead me to replay this note that I sent to John Sowa early last summer,
thematizing an approach that I have been endeavoring to develop, a little
something that I like to think of as "analytic differential ontology"
(ADO).

&gt; Subject:  Ontology &amp; Process
&gt;    Date:  Sun, 04 Jun 2000 14:30:33 -0400
&gt;    From:  Jon Awbrey &lt;jawbrey@oakland.edu&gt;
&gt;      To:  John F Sowa &lt;sowa@bestweb.net&gt;
&gt;
&gt; #%%THIS%%%#%%%IS%%%%#%%%NOT%%%#%%%%A%%%%#%%FRAME%%#
&gt;
&gt; To John Sowa:
&gt;
&gt; Recent mentions of "process ontology" on the CG-list
&gt; have brought me back to related questions that I have
&gt; been working on for some time, from a slightly different
&gt; perspective, perhaps.  I am concerned with the questions
&gt; of "difference in ontology", or "differential ontology",
&gt; including as special studies the issues of diversity and
&gt; change in the ontologies that different observers adopt.
&gt; Some of these questions are:
&gt;
&gt; Is there a reasonable framework or a language for talking
&gt; about "the geometry of the space whose points are views",
&gt; including the working ontologies that go with each and
&gt; every observer's/interpreter's "point of view" (POV)?
&gt;
&gt; Can we put the "chiasmatic commutator" to work on the
&gt; issue of process ontology -- turning the question around,
&gt; from asking about the "ontology of process" to asking about
&gt; the "process of ontology" -- that is, asking what sorts of laws,
&gt; if any, govern the dynamics of change in people's ontologies,
&gt; in other words, in the conceptual frameworks that people use
&gt; to posit their various ontological hierarchies?
&gt;
&gt; My personal approach to these sorts of questions, since the
&gt; complexities of the overlaid and shifting meta-perspectives
&gt; are enough to overwhelm a person at first, has been to stake
&gt; out an initial base camp at that simplest level of ontology
&gt; and conceptual framework that I can imagine, without being
&gt; completely trivial, the world of "zeroth order logic",
&gt; propositional calculus, truth table semantics, venn diagrams,
&gt; in short, the "alpha" part of Peirce's Existential Graphs.
&gt;
&gt; This has certainly been a big enough bite to chew on for a while,
&gt; given the difficulties of the NP-complete satisfiability problems
&gt; that arise, but I have been able to devise an efficient and powerful
&gt; enough extension of Peirce's basic syntax, along with a workable enough
&gt; implementation of basic computational tools for using this
representation,
&gt; that I have been able to begin contemplating the "differential extension"
&gt; of propositional calculus -- in fact, one of the surprises of the whole
&gt; development is that not a few of Peirce's original ideas almost seemed
&gt; to demand this sort of extension.
&gt;
&gt; ( Note:  I think that the most general name for this in mathematics
&gt; | is the "De Rham Extension", and I have begun to look into this,
&gt; | but it is really just what you do when you add differential forms
&gt; | to analytic geometry.  All in all, I am just exploiting the analogy
&gt; | betweeen Propositional Calculus, as a study of functions B^n -&gt; B,
&gt; | and Real Analysis, as a study of functions R^n -&gt; R, and asking:
&gt; | What is the proper form of differential and integral calculus that
&gt; | goes with Prop Calc (Sentential Logic)?
&gt; )
&gt;
&gt; I guess I could be taken as posing the thesis here that one way to
&gt; approach the problem of talking about change and diversity in these
&gt; logical, ontological, or qualitative realms might just be to start by
&gt; looking at what worked in the more quantitative domains of analysis and
&gt; physics.  Of course, it is not likely that everything will turn out to be
&gt; exactly the same, and one must be willing to tolerate a number of
surprises.
&gt;
&lt;...&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Enough for now,
&gt;
&gt; Jon Awbrey
