RAR^N To Go Troops:

Starting from the simplest notions of Rise and Fall,
I may easily have chosen to leave it as an exercise
for the reader to discover suitable generalizations,
say from Rise&lt;k&gt; and Fall&lt;k&gt; for k of order 2 and 3,
to the slightly more general case in which k is any
natural number, that is, finite, integral, positive.
But that is far too easy a calisthenic, and no kind
of a work-out to offer our band of fearless readers,
and so the writer picks up the gage that he himself 
throws down, and for his health runs the easy track!

Let B = {0, 1}.

Let the relation Rise&lt;k&gt; c B^k
be defined in the following way:

| Rise&lt;k&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;
|
| iff
|
| Rise&lt;2&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, x&lt;2&gt;&gt;  and  Rise&lt;k-1&gt;&lt;x&lt;2&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;

Let the relation Fall&lt;k&gt; c B^k
be defined in the following way:

| Fall&lt;k&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;
|
| iff
|
| Fall&lt;2&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, x&lt;2&gt;&gt;  and  Fall&lt;k-1&gt;&lt;x&lt;2&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;

But let me now leave off, for the time being,
from the temptation to go any further in the
direction of increasing k than I ever really
intended to, on beyond 2 or 3 or thereabouts,
for that is not the aim of the present study.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Note 8

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

In this note I revisit the "Between" relation on reals,
and then I rework it as a discrete and finite analogue
of its transcendantal self, as a Between relation on B.
Ultimately, I want to use this construction as working
material to illustrate a method of defining relational
compositions in terms of projections.  So let us begin.

Last time I defined Rise and Fall relations on B^k.
Working polymorphously, as some people like to say,
let us go ahead and define the analogous relations
over the real domain R, not even bothering to make
new names, but merely expecting the reader to find
the aptest sense for a given context of discussion.

Let R be the set of real numbers.

Let the relation named "Rise&lt;2&gt;"
such that Rise&lt;2&gt; c R^2 = R x R,
be defined in the following way:

| Rise&lt;2&gt;&lt;x, y&gt;
|
| iff
|
| [x = y]  or  [x &lt; y]

Let the relation named "Fall&lt;2&gt;"
such that Fall&lt;2&gt; c R^2 = R x R,
be defined in the following way:

| Fall&lt;2&gt;&lt;x, y&gt;
|
| iff
|
| [x &gt; y]  or  [x = y]

There are clearly a number of redundancies
between the definitions of these relations,
but I prefer the symmetry of this approach.

The next pair of definitions will be otiose, too,
if viewed in the light of the comprehensive case
that follows after, but let us go gently for now.

Let the relation named "Rise&lt;3&gt;"
such that Rise&lt;3&gt; c R^3 = RxRxR,
be defined in the following way:

| Rise&lt;3&gt;&lt;x, y, z&gt;
|
| iff
|
| Rise&lt;2&gt;&lt;x, y&gt; and Rise&lt;2&gt;&lt;y, z&gt;

Let the relation named "Fall&lt;3&gt;"
such that Fall&lt;3&gt; c R^3 = RxRxR,
be defined in the following way:

| Fall&lt;3&gt;&lt;x, y, z&gt;
|
| iff
|
| Fall&lt;2&gt;&lt;x, y&gt; and Fall&lt;2&gt;&lt;y, z&gt;

Then Rise&lt;3&gt; and Fall&lt;3&gt; are "degenerate 3-adic relations"
insofar as each of them bears expression as a conjunction
whose conjuncts are expressions of 2-adic relations alone.

Just in order to complete the development
of this thought, let us then finish it so:

Let the relation Rise&lt;k&gt; c R^k
be defined in the following way:

| Rise&lt;k&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;
|
| iff
|
| Rise&lt;2&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, x&lt;2&gt;&gt;  and  Rise&lt;k-1&gt;&lt;x&lt;2&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;

Let the relation Fall&lt;k&gt; c R^k
be defined in the following way:

| Fall&lt;k&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;
|
| iff
|
| Fall&lt;2&gt;&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, x&lt;2&gt;&gt;  and  Fall&lt;k-1&gt;&lt;x&lt;2&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt;

If there was a point to writing out this last step,
I think that it may well have been how easy it was
not to write, not literally to "write" at all, but
simply to "cut and paste" the definitions from the
boolean case, and then but to change the parameter
B into the parameter R at a mere one place in each.

Let us then push on, in a retrograde way, returning to the orbit
of those very first relations that got us into the midst of this
quandary in the first place, to wit, the relations in medias res,
the relations of betwixt and between and all of their sundry kin.
But let us this time place the paltry special relations on which
we fixed the first time around back within the setting of a much
broader and a much more systematically examined context, that is,
an extended family of related relations or variations on a theme.

I hope that you will be able to recall that cousin of
the Between relation that we took up here once before,
and that you will be able to recognize its characters,
even if I now disguise it under a new name and partly
dissemble them under a new manner of parameterization.
Where you might take the name "IO" to mean "in order",
it is the relation defined on three real numbers thus:

Let the relation named "IO&lt;213&gt;"
such that IO&lt;213&gt; c R^3 = RxRxR,
be defined in the following way:

| IO&lt;213&gt;&lt;x, a, b&gt;  iff  [a &lt; x &lt; b],
|
| equivalently,
|
| IO&lt;213&gt;&lt;x, a, b&gt;  iff  [a &lt; x] and [x &lt; b].

Corresponding to the 3-adic relation IO&lt;213&gt; c R^3 = RxRxR,
there is a "proposition", a function io&lt;213&gt; : R^3 -&gt; B,
that I will describe, until a better name comes along,
as the "relation map" that is "dual to" the relation.
It is also known as the "indicator" of that relation.

Consider the boolean analogue or the logical variant of IO,
with real domains : R now replaced by boolean domains : B.

The boolean analogue of the ordering "&lt;" is the implication "=&gt;",
so the logical variant of the relation IO&lt;213&gt; is given this way:

Let the relation named "IO&lt;213&gt;"
such that IO&lt;213&gt; c B^3 = BxBxB,
be defined in the following way:

| IO&lt;213&gt;&lt;x, a, b&gt;
|
| iff
|
| [a =&gt; x] and [x =&gt; b]

When it does not risk any confusion,
one can express this also like this:

| IO&lt;213&gt;&lt;x, a, b&gt;
|
| iff
|
| a =&gt; x =&gt; b

Corresponding to the 3-adic relation IO&lt;213&gt; c B^3 = BxBxB,
there is a "proposition", a function io&lt;213&gt; : B^3 -&gt; B,
that I will describe, until a better name comes along,
as the "relation map" that is "dual to" the relation.
It is also known as the "indicator" of that relation.

At this point I want to try and get away with a bit
of additional flexibility in the syntax that I use,
reusing some of the same names for what are distinct
but closely related types of mathematical objects.

In particular, I would like to have the license
to speak a bit more loosely about these objects,
to ignore the distinction between "relations" of
the form Q c X&lt;1&gt; x ... x X&lt;k&gt; and "relation maps"
of the form q : X&lt;1&gt; x ... x X&lt;k&gt; -&gt; B, and even
on sundry informal occasions to use the very same
names for them -- The Horror! -- hoping to let the
context determine the appropriate type of object,
except where it may be necessary to maintain this
distinction in order to avoid risking confusion.

In order to keep track of all of the players -- not to mention all of the refs! --
it may help to re-introduce a diagram that I have used many times before, as a
kind of a play-book or programme, to sort out the burgeoning teams of objects
and the cryptic arrays of signs that we need to follow throughout the course
of this rather extended into overtime game:

Matthew West wrote to Adam Pease:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

What Matthew says here makes a lot of sense to me.

By way of illustrating the application of these heuristic principles
in the case of Adam Pease's Between relation, we might consider the
following analysis:

Given a =/= b, I will pull the usual trick and say,
"without loss of generality" (WOLOG), assume a &lt; b.

Then:

| x is between a and b
|
| if and only if
|
| a &lt; x and x &lt; b

Now, if we are operating under what are likely to be
the default assumptions, the intended context, or the
standard interpretation of these statements, then the
sentence "x &lt; y" invokes a dyadic relation LT c R x R,
where R = Reals, and this in turn corresponds to the
proposition lt : RxR -&gt; B, where B = {0, 1} as usual.

This allows us to articulate the sentence "x is between a and b"
as invoking a certain 3-adic relation "1st between 2nd and 3rd",
or let us call it "IO&lt;213&gt;" for short, such that IO&lt;213&gt; c R^3,
and this in turn corresponds to the proposition  io&lt;213&gt; : R^3 -&gt; B.

Last but not least, recall that conjunction is just a function
that maps two propositions into a proposition, in other words,
a function of the form 'and' : (X -&gt; B) x (X -&gt; B) -&gt; (X -&gt; B).

Now here's a good question:  What is X?
To be specific, is it R^2 or is it R^3?

We appear to have a little bit of a problem
matching up the divers pieces of the puzzle.

What this requires is a little gimmick that I call a "tacit extension".
In this case, we need a way of taking the function lt : R^2 -&gt; B and
using it to construct two different functions of type : R^3 -&gt; B.

Thus we need a couple of functions on functions, both having this form:

   te : (R&lt;1&gt; x R&lt;2&gt; -&gt; B) -&gt; (R&lt;1'&gt; x R&lt;2'&gt; x R&lt;3'&gt; -&gt; B),

Here we must now distinguish particular copies of R
in the cartesian products RxR = R^2 and RxRxR = R^3.

| Tacit extension 21 is defined by:  (te&lt;21&gt;(f))(x, a, b) = f(a, x).
|
| Tacit extension 13 is defined by:  (te&lt;13&gt;(f))(x, a, b) = f(x, b).

Applying these tacit extensions to lt we get:

| (te&lt;21&gt;(lt))(x, a, b)  =  lt&lt;21&gt;(x, a, b) = lt(a, x)
|
| (te&lt;13&gt;(lt))(x, a, b)  =  lt&lt;13&gt;(x, a, b) = lt(x, b)

In effect, the tacit extension of the "less than" map,
given three arguments, just compares the proper pair
of them, with a "don't care" condition on the other.

Putting all of these pieces together, we have this picture:

          lt(a, x)  .       .  lt(x, b)
                    |       |
                    |       |
            te&lt;21&gt;  o       o  te&lt;13&gt;
                    |       |
                    |       |
   lt&lt;21&gt;(x, a, b)  .       .  lt&lt;13&gt;(x, a, b)
                     \     /
                      \   /
                       \ /
                      [and]
                        |
                        |
                        |
                        .
                 io&lt;213&gt;(x, a, b)

This gives a functional decomposition of the proposition io&lt;213&gt;
making use of two different applications of the proposition lt,
a couple of tacit extensions te&lt;21&gt; and te&lt;13&gt;, and the reusable
function 'and' that connects the tacit extensions of lt together.

What is the use of all of this? -- especially in view of the fact
that we did not reduce the maximum arity of the relations involved?

In sum, we started with a 3-adic relation map  io&lt;213&gt; : R^3 -&gt; B,
getting a pair of 2-adic relation maps of the form  lt : R^2 -&gt; B,
plus two tacit extensions of the form  te : (R^2 -&gt; B)  -&gt;  (R^3 -&gt; B),
and a 3-adic relation of the shape  'and' : (R^3 -&gt; B)^2 -&gt; (R^3 -&gt; B).

Well, the advantage, over the long haul, comes precisely from the fact
that the seemingly more complex pieces that we reached in the analysis
are pieces that are highly reusable in situation after situation, and
so it is worth the overhead, eventually, that it takes to understand
these recurring components as thoroughly as possible.

That brings an end to these Legends of the Fall,
And so I wish a gentle night to you one and all.

Jon Awbrey
