David,

&gt; I think there is a saying about 'buying a pig in a poke'.
&gt; It is very hard for me (and expect for many on this list)
&gt; to commit to helping with an on-line collaboration tool without
&gt; clear understanding of what time and energy and intellectual commitments
&gt; are being requested.
&gt;
&gt; I go by slashdot every few days to see if anything interesting
&gt; there may catch my fancy, but there seems to be a need for the SUO
&gt; group of more than just a way of threading messages better.
[...]
&gt; I think we should follow up on the offer by Aaron quoted from John Sowa:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Since then, I have corresponded with Aaron Swartz (excerpts below),
&gt; &gt;who is developing Blogspace, which he describes as "a powerful,
&gt; &gt;hyperlinked system for building websites."  See the description:
&gt; &gt;   <A  HREF="http://www.blogspace.com/about/">http://www.blogspace.com/about/</A>
&gt;
&gt; Let's see if it provides a better method of collaborative work.

Blogspace sounds very interesting, however it has some apparent
disadvantages:

- There are not yet any examples of its use, so far as I can find...
- Precisely how it will work and what it will do is still evolving...Aaron
says it is not quite done yet...
- Aaron is recommending that suo.ieee.org be pointed to Blogspace, which
seems like too major a step to take at this time, relative to the level of
development that Blogspace has achieved.

&gt; Subject: SUO: An idea needs a champion
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; John and All,
&gt;
&gt; 	Every idea needs a champion.  John has posted this idea, but unless
&gt; someone volunteers to champion it, it won't go anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; Jim
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   Following
&gt; is a repeat of the note I sent a few days ago (but to which no one
&gt; has so far replied).
&gt;
&gt; John Sowa

&gt;
&gt; Subject:     Proposal for a new web server
&gt;       Date:  Sun, 13 May 2001 12:57:47 -0400
&gt;       From:  "John F. Sowa" &lt;sowa@bestweb.net&gt;
&gt;         To:  standard-upper-ontology@ieee.org
&gt;         CC:  aswartz@swartzfam.com
&gt;
&gt; In my earlier notes, I suggested that the SUO list should be moved
&gt; to a different hosting system that might reduce the amount of traffic
&gt; to the main list.  There was some interest in the idea, but no one has
&gt; volunteered to put in the effort to install and maintain the software.
&gt;
&gt; Since then, I have corresponded with Aaron Swartz (excerpts below),
&gt; who is developing Blogspace, which he describes as "a powerful,
&gt; hyperlinked system for building websites."  See the description:
&gt;
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.blogspace.com/about/">http://www.blogspace.com/about/</A>
&gt;
&gt; Aaron has tested his software on a relatively low-traffic email list,
&gt; but he would be very interested in scaling it up to a heavy volume
&gt; list, such SUO list (unfortunately) has become.  His main interests
&gt; are in developing collaboration software that takes advantage of
&gt; RDF and other W3C standards and proposals.  Since his interests have
&gt; a large overlap with the interests of many participants in the SUO,
&gt; we might be able to reach a mutually satisfactory solution:
&gt;
&gt;  1. SUO gets a collaboration system that can move a large amount of
&gt;     the email traffic to separate threads, and no one on the list
&gt;     has to do the really hard work of developing, installing, and
&gt;     maintaining the software or the web site.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Aaron Swartz gets a large group of live guinea pigs to test
&gt;     his software, provide feedback, and suggest ways of tailoring
&gt;     the system to support better collaboration.
&gt;
&gt; Following are excerpts from the correspondence.  Please cc Aaron Swartz
&gt; on any discussion concerning this proposal.

&gt; &gt;&gt; In the first note, I suggested that we replace the e-mail format
&gt; &gt;&gt; by a web-zine format, using the free Slash software that has been
&gt; &gt;&gt; developed by Slashdot.  There is some interest in it, but no one
&gt; &gt;&gt; wants to volunteer to install and maintain the software.
&gt;
&gt; Aaron Swartz wrote:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, Slash is a nice piece of software, but I've heard it's a pain to
&gt; &gt; maintain. Of course, I've been known to hear things...
&gt;
&gt; JS&gt;&gt; Question:  Would you
&gt; &gt;&gt; be interested in using the SUO site as a test case?  The SUO people
&gt; &gt;&gt; aren't willing to volunteer to do the programming, but they could
&gt; &gt;&gt; provide a web host on the IEEE.org web site (which currently hosts
&gt; &gt;&gt; the archives and e-mail for SUO).  If you are willing
&gt; &gt;&gt; to install the blogspace software and do the maintenance necessary to
&gt; &gt;&gt; turn it into a serviceable collaboration tool, this site would give
&gt; &gt;&gt; you a lot of test cases and a lot of exposure.
&gt;
&gt; AS&gt; Blogspace is reasonably complicated to set up, and I'm tired of
&gt; maintaining
&gt; &gt; three of my own servers, so I don't really need a third from
&gt; someone else.
&gt; &gt; What would you say if we pointed the suo.ieee.org site to the Blogspace
&gt; &gt; server. That way it could look like a separate site, but would
&gt; actually be
&gt; &gt; maintained on my server. Would that be acceptable?
&gt;
&gt; AS&gt; I'd really love to get the usability testing and comments from your
&gt; group
&gt; &gt; and so I'm excited about allowing you to test it. However, I must admit
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; Blogspace isn't quite done yet (there are two or three major features
&gt; &gt; necessary before it becomes a really good collaboration tool -- comments
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; messages and versioning) and I don't have a large amount of time to
&gt; dedicate
&gt; &gt; to it at the moment. That should change next month, however.
