Dear Lee,

&gt; &gt; Dear Lee,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since I do not view your position as philosophically or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; logically adequate
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the full range of human experience, 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: I note this. What I lack is evidence or proof that your view is
&gt; &gt; correct. If you can identify where the position is inadequate and
&gt; &gt; which ranges of human experience it does not apply to then we might
&gt; &gt; make progress.
&gt; 
&gt; There was a Polish philosopher named Tadeusz Kotarbinski who took
&gt; something like your position to great lengths.  He variously 
&gt; called his
&gt; position reism, pan-somatism, concretism, semantic reism. 

MW: I'm not familiar with this person, but I support his approach of
taking things to great lengths. This way you see if it breaks, and
where, and then you know the limitations.

&gt; Tarski, insofar
&gt; as he bothered to work out a metaphysical position, acknowledged
&gt; Kotarbinski as his master and his early and famous work on 
&gt; truth in formal
&gt; systems is couched to make place for a reist approach.
&gt; 
&gt; I once spent a good bit of effort to show how this position, 
&gt; which is not
&gt; my own, can be stretched to cover just about anything, 
&gt; including ethics
&gt; and aesthetics. But it has one great limitation that may have 
&gt; some bearing
&gt; on an SUO effort.  It covers experience after the fact, after the
&gt; experience has become manifest in some spatio-temporal phenomenon.  

MW: This is no longer true when you introduce a possible worlds
approach which allows you to consider possible futures, either
hypothetical or intended, as well as possible pasts, which may be 
linked to or detatched from the present.

&gt; It
&gt; thus sees little point in asserting experience, human or 
&gt; otherwise, as a
&gt; broader category than empiria.  Thus in your recent exchange 
&gt; on 'giving'
&gt; with Chris Menzel, you cover giving after an act of giving has become
&gt; manifest, while Chris would like to assert some ternary aspect to the
&gt; logic of giving, or in natural language to the dative case, 
&gt; whether or not
&gt; it is made manifest in an activity.

MW: You can express as many aspects to giving as you wish. Whether you
use binary or ternary relations is largely a matter of how you want to
view things, not what you are viewing.

&gt; 
&gt; Now I would not argue that you fail to 'cover' giving, since you can
&gt; provide a verbal account of each and every instance after it 
&gt; occurs, and
&gt; once an act has occurred to every 'extension' of it in the 
&gt; sense you use
&gt; this term, but I would argue that there is something about 
&gt; the logic of
&gt; the dative case that is missing in your view of it. 

MW: Our model can deal with an arbitrary number of things involved
with giving. We simply choose to represent them in a binary form
(from a KIF point of view). It can then from this base of information
support views that might be ternary or what ever is wished for.

&gt; And I 
&gt; would also argue
&gt; what is missing in the binary view of giving is also missing 
&gt; in the binary
&gt; treatment of other concepts crucial to an account of human 
&gt; institutions,
&gt; including the institution of science.

MW: Some examples rather than assertions would be really helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; With respect to a computational ontology to be used in 
&gt; conjunction with a
&gt; relational database, my argument may make no practical 
&gt; difference so long
&gt; as we are interested in using the ontology to search and mine what has
&gt; already been achieved and certified in some sense as 
&gt; information.  But to
&gt; the extent that we may wish to use an ontological artifact 
&gt; for sciences of
&gt; discovery or for deliberation, which contain a purely 
&gt; hypothetical or even
&gt; imaginative element, and in which we wish to be especially alert to
&gt; emergent categories and to the repurposing and reconceptualizing of
&gt; information for unanticipated needs, we may want to provide
&gt; architectonically for a position that concedes a degree of reality to
&gt; concepts without grounding them dogmatically in some 'concrete'
&gt; manifestation and its extensions. 

MW: As stated above all this is supported through the possible worlds
approach we incorrporate, as stated above.

MW: Also think about how likely it is that I would be able to have a 
position that was not capable of lookihng forwards as well as backwards.
Shell is one of the most successful companies in the world, and has been
continuously for about 100 years. One of the reasons for this is its 
expertise in planning ... What chance would I have internally if I 
couldn't support that?
&gt; 
&gt; I am, of course, able to participate cheerfully in an 
&gt; ontology constructed
&gt; on principles in the general family to which your position belongs, so
&gt; long as the purpose of the effort is clarified to be limited 
&gt; to uses for
&gt; which this position is appropriate.  

MW: One reason I am pursuing this discussion is that if there really
are things it cannot handle, I would really like to know.

&gt; But if, as in our current effort,
&gt; there is strong resistance to narrowing the purpose, 

MW: I do not wish to rule out other view points. If you read up on the 
IIDEAS architecture you will see that I think it is important to be 
able to support a range of different viewpoints for different purposes,
but that also I want a view that is able to support/integrate all of them
(if possible - I recognise that it may not be).

&gt; I would 
&gt; counsel that
&gt; what I would regard as a more capacious and open-ended view 
&gt; not be ruled
&gt; out prematurely.

MW: And what would that be?


Regards  
      Matthew
