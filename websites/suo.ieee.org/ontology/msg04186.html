&gt;Adam,
&gt;
&gt;AP&gt; Forgive me for being a bit pointed, but I continue to be very troubled
&gt;by
&gt;claims that appear to me unjustified, unspecific or unsupported on this
&gt;list.  If you believe Cyc and SUMO are &quot;not sufficiently accurate&quot;, what
&gt;metric is that in regard to?  Is there a particular axiom in either that
&gt;you could point out that would lead to an incorrect or inaccurate
&gt;conclusion during the course of logical deduction?
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, as I and a number of other people have pointed out on this list
&gt;many times the issue is not about particular axioms which one can tinker
&gt;with for the rest of our lives - with little effect. My recollection of the
&gt;discussion at the workshop in Seattle was that it was agreed that the top
&gt;levels were not particularly well regimented and that they needed more
&gt;work - one area discussed being, I recall mereology. Your recent post
&gt;admitting no policy for dealing with the difference between attribution and
&gt;exemplification is another example. At the more detailed level, I recall a
&gt;number of people pointed out a number of problems with the notion of
&gt;transaction and process - a point I raised personally with you.

If I were to say to Nicola for example that his upper ontology was &quot;not 
particularly well regimented&quot; would that be a useful comment?  Surely he 
would expect me to justify it, and explain which terms were out of place 
and how specifically I would suggest to reorganize it.  I went to Casati 
and Varzi and said the mereology they propose in Parts and Places was bad, 
they would expect me to provide a specific example that shows a problem, 
and what axioms that I would suggest changing to fix it.  When people have 
made specific points and suggestions for a fix, we've been able to have a 
serious discussion and make fixes.

&gt;I am &quot;very troubled&quot; that these issues continue to be ignored.
&gt;
&gt;To take an example from Cyc, relating to the enterprise, it seems to me from
&gt;the data I have that it regards positions as a role of a person. This is not
&gt;sufficient to track the identity of a position - such as the English
&gt;Monarch. (If I am wrong, I would like to know.) I believe I raised the
&gt;general requirement when the enterprise module of SUMO was being discussed
&gt;and I seem to recall SUMO was amended.

This is a good example of a testable claim.  If you could provide similar 
examples for other parts of SUMO, that would be constructive.

&gt;CP&gt;It seems to me that if we are looking for the kind of general ontologies
&gt; &gt;that Bill suspects are not feasible, then we need to address the demands
&gt; &gt;of accuracy and regimentation at both the top and domain levels. In my
&gt; &gt;view, for the kind of applications that fall under Bill Anderson s 3), it
&gt; &gt;is only really possible to do these together.
&gt;
&gt;AP&gt;Indeed.  How would you suggest that we proceed, or proceed differently?
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me that what the meeting in Seattle agreed - a process of
&gt;regimenting the top level seems sensible. My experience is that the lower
&gt;levels normally benefit from some contact with reality. There are two
&gt;complementary strategies - first extracting (re-engineering) the information
&gt;from existing working systems and secondly using the SUMO to integrate
&gt;systems. Obviously, in both case the goal is not to just find any way
&gt;matching up the systems, but trying to find ways of improving the ontology.

I agree that regimenting the top level seems sensible.  I believe we have 
accomplished that.  If you feel differently, please define what a 
&quot;regimented&quot; top would be and how it would differ from the existing SUMO.

I agree that the lower levels benefit from &quot;contact with reality&quot;.  One way 
to define that is that domain-specific ontologies are developed as 
extensions to the SUMO.  I've cited published papers about domain-specific 
military extensions.  Did you mean something different?
