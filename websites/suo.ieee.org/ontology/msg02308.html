Filament 4.  Extensional Examples, L0 and L1

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Matthew,

I extend my earlier remarks on the Tale of L0 and L1.
Current commentary is inserted in unindented fashion.

Just to refresh your memory, here are L0 and L1 once again:

---------------------------------------------------
|
| Relation L0
|
| L0 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 0}.
|
| L0 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
|
|   &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;   =   000
|   &lt;0, 1, 1&gt;   =   011
|   &lt;1, 0, 1&gt;   =   101
|   &lt;1, 1, 0&gt;   =   110
|
---------------------------------------------------
|
| Relation L1
|
| L1 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 1}.
|
| L1 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
|
|   &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;   =   001
|   &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;   =   010
|   &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;   =   100
|   &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;   =   111
|
---------------------------------------------------
|
| Most recent exposition of L0 &amp; L1 is at:
|
| <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg04575.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg04575.html</A>
|
---------------------------------------------------

JA:  The relation L0 is the set of 3-tuples
     of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 such that
     x + y + z = O, as I explained in the
     initial presentation, where "+" is
     taken "modulo 2", or equivalently,
     in the "Galois Field of Order 2",
     GF(2).

JA:  A "field" is a mathematical system where you have
     things analogous to the usual "four operations" of
     addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

JA:  GF(2) consists of the set B = {0, 1} along with
     the following addition and multiplication tables:

|     + | 0 1
|     -------
|     0 | 0 1
|     1 | 1 0
|
|     . | 0 1
|     -------
|     0 | 0 0
|     1 | 0 1

JA:  Since binary operations are ternary relations,
     these can also be written as relational tables:

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x+y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    1    |
|  1  |  0  |    1    |
|  1  |  1  |    0    |
o-----o-----o---------o

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x.y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  If you interpret B = {0, 1} as a set of logical values
     in the usual way, that is, with 0 = false and 1 = true,
     then addition has the meaning of exclusive disjunction,
     and multiplication has the meaning of conjunction.

JA:  Galois Fields and other finite fields are widely
     employed in error-correcting codes these days,
     among many other places in applied maths.

JA:  Here begins your putative translation of L0 &amp; L1
     into 2-adic form.  If I understand you correctly,
     for i = 0, 1, for j = 1, 2, 3, 4, and for r, s, t
     in B, the following sort of schema:

     |   (L&lt;i&gt;-row L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt;)
     |   (x L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; r)
     |   (y L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; s)
     |   (z L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; t)

     is intended to say that:

     |   L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is a row in L&lt;i&gt;
     |   and the x position in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is r
     |   and the y position in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is s
     |   and the z position in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is t.

JA:  No doubt you will regard it as "tria-some" of me
     to keep reminding you that each and every one of
     those tokens of your truth-functional connective
     "and" is an invocation of a 3-adic relation, and
     that the mere magical practice of muttering them
     under one's breath does not a single bit of good
     to cancel what your moving finger omits to write,
     nor serve to wish away the adamant computational
     reality of the hard, logical, &amp; unyielding facts.

JA:  But I believe that all of that, "banal truism" that
     it may indeed reflect, has now become but the least
     of your problems, due to all these "brave new words"
     that you have added in this translated text.

JA:  Let me now accord you the benefit of a certain doubt,
     and presume that your schema is to be read like this:

     |   L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is a row in L&lt;i&gt;
     |   and the-x-position-in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is r
     |   and the-y-position-in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is s
     |   and the-z-position-in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is t.

     Here, the hyphenated phrases:

     |   the-x-position-in,
     |   the-y-position-in,
     |   the-x-position-in,

     can be read as the names of three 2-adic relations,
     in particular, functions, that can be written just
     a little more concisely and conventionally in this
     rather more standard -- standard to many -- manner:

     |   Proj&lt;k&gt; : T x U -&gt; B, for k = 1, 2, 3,

     respectively.  Here, rather than making up yet another
     new series of names, I am leaving it to the context to
     mark the fact that these Proj's are a suitable sort of
     "extended projections", which take the name of a Table
     in the set T and the number of a Row in the set U, and
     yield the value in the indicated column k, k = 1, 2, 3.

JA:  Well, these are fine and dandy brands of operation,
     but there are a couple of things that they are not:

     1.  They are not less than or equal to 2-adic in their arity.
     2.  They do not translate the content of the original tables.

Let me now establish these two claims.

1.  That these "extended or generalized projections",
    Proj&lt;k&gt; : T x U -&gt; B, in this case for k = 1, 2, 3,
    with T being a domain of tables or else their names,
    with U being a domain of row numbers, of a proper sort,
    and where k is a column number, of an appropriate kind,
    go beyond being 2-adic in their arities or valencies --
    I believe this to be clear on the face of it, and so
    perhaps the only question is whether any person has
    perpetrated an impertinence by bringing them into
    the fray, but it was you who invited them to the
    party -- all I did nothing more outré than more
    formally to introduce them, quite as I earlier
    promised that I should, and so I will simply
    have to leave it to you to answer for their
    conduct and their bearing on the affairs
    at stake.

2.  Let us recall that we have all agreed, at least, so long as we continue
    on our present extensional course, that a relation is a "set" of tuples,
    and by a set to say we end the cardinal account and the thousand numbed
    shocks that a keyed-up table is heir to,- 'tis a summarization devoutly
    to be wish'd.  To set! perchance to forget: -- AI, there's the rub that
    erases all the numb and getting number identifiers that shuffle off our
    more tabular coil.

    Where was I -- halfway gone on vacation, that's where! --
    but miles to go, and a' that ...

    The message here is just what I tried to advise you about
    from the very beginnings of my entry into this exposition,
    namely, that indexed, keyed, ordered, or sequenced tables
    are not legitimate ways of addressing this problem, among
    other things, because they convert a set of tuples into a
    list of tuples or a sequence of tuples, which is a rather
    distinct mathematical object or data structure, no matter
    how one chooses to look at it.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~AUTO~CITE~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
    
I forget where this bit started, so I will just break in here ...

I wish that those of you who fail to see the cogency of various
logical arguments on this score would try at least the following
experiment:  Amble on down the mountain to the ordinary zen world
of your friendly local neighborhood Data Group, and tell them that
due to the latest round of corporate down-sizing, all relational
data tables will now be restricted to just two columns, not two
plus a key or two plus an index, just two, and that this rule
will be strictly enforced right down to the bare bones level
of assembly language, no funny business with hidden indices
and secret keys tucked away to the various nooks and crannies
in which your average computer geeks know how to squirrel away
all of their best kernels'o'wit if not to say their bits'o'honey.

What will happen?  Most likely, from experience, one of two things:

1.  They will go away mumbling something about "turd normal farm",
    and wondering what brand'o'moron or other rough beast has now
    come round alas to rake over the company.

2.  Having learned, from experience, to be play-along sorts of folks,
    they will say "Sure, Boss! Get right on it!", and go away doing
    precisely what they always do, knowing that none'o'you prophets
    would ever have even the first clue where to look for the nuts.

Just me, talking to no one in particular,
