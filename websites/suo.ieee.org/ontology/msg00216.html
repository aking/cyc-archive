John, 
	.	I admit, when I saw this e-mail title, my reaction was:
"Good! Now I can find out what actual SOU content would look like".
Unfortunately, no such luck.

	.	I am keen to see what health and welfare structures are
appropriate for the SUO, and add to and/or comment on what's there (if there
is a "there", yet, as opposed to lots of e-mail traffic about logical
structures and language forms, etc.). 

	.	 Can you give me a pointer to this sort of content that I
can access with ordinary software, such as from MS office, etc., please? 

	.	Alternatively, can you point me to st that will allow me to
access ".kif files", so I can access some of the files Jim has sent me? 



.	On a different note, I always thought the source of a river is "the
most distant point in the drainage basin" of the river of the same name
"from which surface water ran year round, or the furthest point from which
water could possibly flow to the" oceans. Thus, based on official names, if
a tributary was longer than the main river (the one ending at the ocean or
other final basin), then, its source wouldn't be the main river's source. 

	.	We have rivers like this in Australia. For example, Sydney,
about 600 sq. km, along with Sydney Harbour and the Parramatta River, is
literally encircled by rivers thanks to slightly unusual geography. On the
north side, the Nepean (to the west and south) is a tributary to the Cox's
River (to the north west), which is a tributary to the Hawkesbury (to the
north). The longest distance comes from the Nepean, tho' I understood this
isn't the source of the Hawkesbury, which is to the North. The history is
that the rivers were each discovered and named independently quite a few
years before the realisation was made of their connections. One had to bear
in mind that the decision to settle NSW in 1788 sprang from Britain's loss
of the American War of Independence (1776 iirc), and this discovery etc.
happened by approx. 1800. 



	.	As a matter of interest, the upper waters of the Nepean come
within 2 or 3 km of the Georges River, where they parallel each other for
some 10 km or so on a meandering route. The Georges River empties into the
Pacific South of Sydney Harbour. From almost every point within the bounds
of these rivers, including from beyond the nearest point between the Nepean
and Georges, it is impossible to travel a straight line without crossing at
least one of them, or else heading directly out into the Pacific Ocean to
the East. 

	.	Yes, I have thought about circumnavigating Sydney by boat
without leaving NSW.

Subject:	SUO: A typical definition


A major purpose of the SUO is to establish a foundation for sharing,
reusing, and calibrating the ontologies of independently developed systems
that need to interoperate.

A precise, formal notation, such as KIF, is necessary for stating the
definitions and axioms.  But long before we get to the stage where we can
begin writing anything formal, it is necessary to negotiate (usually in a
natural language) what we need to formalize.

As an example of the problems involved, I would like to cite the recent
story about the discovery of the source of the Amazon River:

  <A  HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm</A>

The Amazon River has been known to western explorers for nearly 500 years,
but its source was not discovered until 1971, and all the controversies had
not been resolved until now.  Following are the kinds of options that the
explorers had to consider:

   Smithsonian Institution geographer Andrew Johnson said the source
   of the Amazon could be defined as the most distant point in the
   drainage basin from which surface water ran year round, or the
   furthest point from which water could possibly flow to the Atlantic.
   "The Nevado Mismi fits both of these definitions," said Johnson.

Note that people have been talking about the Amazon and "its source" for
centuries before they had a clear idea of the definition of "its source" or
the actual referent of that term.  Yet people have been able to talk
effectively about those undefinited and unknown entities, discuss alternate
definitions, and plan expeditions to search for the actual referents -- all
without having a clear idea of what they were looking for.

The following quotation from the above article gives some idea of the size
of a typical expedition:

   The NGS team included 22 members from the United States, Poland,
   Peru, Canada and Spain. They moved by foot, Jeep, bicycle and
   horseback to explore the five remote Andean rivers that combine
   to form the Amazon - the Apurimac, Huallaga, Mantaro, Maranion
   and Urubamba-Vilcanota.

Observation:  This level of effort is necessary to define nearly every term
in the ontology, ranging from the most general terms at the top down to the
referents of what Russell called "definite descriptions" such as "the source
of the Amazon".

I wanted to mention this example for two reasons:  The first is that we are
undertaking a very large task -- a point that has been noted on this list
many times from different perspectives.  The second is that before any
formal axioms can be written, a great deal of informal analysis, study,
discussion, negotation, and often very arduous and back-breaking work must
be done to determine exactly what is to be formalized.

John Sowa
