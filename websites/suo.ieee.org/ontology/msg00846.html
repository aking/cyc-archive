Martin,

Pat and I usually agree on mathematical and logical issues
and the terminology used to talk about them.  However, we
have been engaged in an interminable war about how the
formalisms are related to the world.  At the moment, we
are in the middle of a truce, which we agreed upon in order
to get on with the task of defining the foundations of KIF
and CGs.

At the risk of disturbing that truce, I would like to make
a comment that illustrates exactly where our disagreement lies.
The philosophical difference between Pat and me is illustrated
by the following diagram:

   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A>

On the left is the world, which Pat and I agree exists.
On the right is a theory, about which Pat and I usually
agree.  In the middle is a model of some aspect of the world.

The difference between us is that I maintain that it is much
more convenient to treat models as abstract constructions
that have a mapping to whatever aspects of the world that we
may be interested in studying, talking about, planning for, etc.
Pat, however, maintains that "a Tarski-style model" is or
should be constructed out of actual entities in the world, not
just pointers to or surrogates of entities.

The truce consists in our agreeing that both kinds of models
can be isomorphic to one another, and for purely mathematical
discussions, there is no distinguishable difference between
a model made up of "real-world entities" or a model made up
of "pointers" or "surrogates".  There is, however, a difference
in the kinds of natural language comments that one might make
about those models and the kinds of metalevel reasoning that
one might use in relating models to the world.

Some comments on your comments:

&gt;2. I ( and maybe others like Graham Horn) rightly or wrongly feel it ought

&gt;to be possible to have a formal language and explanations which are easier

&gt;to understand and to easier to interpret than much of what we see written
&gt;by mathematicians as referring to the real world.

I definitely agree.

&gt;....  Furthermore, within IT, the word Relation is
&gt;strongly associated with what I believe is a correct but relatively limited

&gt;application of the mathematical concept propounded by Ted Codd, viz. the
&gt;use and manipulation of tables of constant surrogates (?grounded tuples).

Pat's major complaint about that view is that it limits
the theory to finite tables.  I think that we can all agree
to use the IT view, provided that we generalize the word
to admit arbitrarily large (possibly uncountable) tables.
Then the word "table" becomes a convenient synonym for
"extension of a relation", and IT people can visualize them
as printable displays while mathematicians are free to consider
infinite tables in their formalism.

&gt;I will raise another potential hazard.  The way the word  Model is used in

&gt;mathematics can appear to be the exact inverse of its natural language
&gt;meaning.  In natural language if I say A is a model of B, it is B that is
&gt;the real thing, the building, aircraft, or whatever.  I understand
&gt;mathematicians to refer to some reality as a model of the mathematical
&gt;theory.  I don't wish to spend time arguing this, but suggest noting the
&gt;risk.

Carl Adam Petri (of Petri-net fame) made exactly that point
about 30 years ago, and he argued for something very close
to my mthworld.gif picture.  Since Carl, Pat, and I have all
been trained as mathematicians, it is misleading to say that
the disagreement is between mathematicians and IT people.

Suggestion:  To bring an end to this endless e-mail debate,
I recommend the following compromise:

 1. When talking about the semantic foundations of a formal
    language, such as KIF or CGs, we discuss the methods of
    evaluating the truth of a statement in terms of a model
    without worrying about what the bottom-level elements of
    the model may happen to be.

 2. When talking about how predicates or relations in KIF
    are mapped to "real world" entities, we can discuss the
    problems of measurement and experimental error by talking
    about syntactic features of the language and about the
    methods of mapping them to the world without using the
    word "model".

 3. Whenever it does become necessary to talk about models
    and the world in the same breath, we can use the terms
    "abstract model" for what I talk about when I use the
    word "model" and "concrete model" for what Pat means
    when he uses the word "model".
