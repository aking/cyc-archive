Hi Martin
&gt;
&gt;1. In the context of the SUO you wish to use statements in a formal
&gt;language (e.g. KIF) and explanations using terms well defined in logic or
&gt;mathematics (e.g. relation).  You interpret these as talking about the
&gt;world, and see any layer of indirection as complexity.
&gt;
&gt;2. I ( and maybe others like Graham Horn) rightly or wrongly feel it ought
&gt;to be possible to have a formal language and explanations which are easier
&gt;to understand and to easier to interpret than much of what we see written
&gt;by mathematicians as referring to the real world.

Well, OK, but I dont see these as incompatible. For example, I think 
what is giving Graham indigestion is the *syntax* of KIF, not its 
'formal' nature. He finds something like ACE more cogenial, which is 
fine with me. As long as we can inter-translate, I really don;t much 
care what syntax we use.  I use KIF because I find it easy to read, 
but I know Im in a minority.

&gt;I now see more clearly why there are particular problems with the words
&gt;Relation and Relationship.  The mathematical term refers to, rightly from
&gt;the mathematical point of view, a very general and powerful concept which
&gt;can be used to represent a very wide range of things in the world.
&gt;Although Relationship can also be used in natural language in a very wide
&gt;variety of ways, its most frequent use is only a restricted sub-set of what
&gt;Relation can describe.

Yes, I agree with you here. One might well want to say (in fact I do) 
that not every set of n-tuples should be counted as a relation. One 
can make up all sorts of insane sets of pairs, for example {&lt;me, my 
cat&gt; &lt;3, a hydrogen atom&gt; &lt;the color red, 19.54&gt;}. But my point was 
only that all the ones that *are* relations are sets of n-tuples.
I should in all honestly say that I am probably in a minority here 
among the philosophically/logically trained folk on this mailing 
list. Many of my colleagues insist that relations are *not* just 
their extensions (sets of n-tuples) but have a more intensional true 
meaning. However, this view isnt, in fact, reflected in the logics we 
all have to use to talk about them.

&gt; Furthermore, within IT, the word Relation is
&gt;strongly associated with what I believe is a correct but relatively limited
&gt;application of the mathematical concept propounded by Ted Codd, viz. the
&gt;use and manipulation of tables of constant surrogates (?grounded tuples).
&gt;Maybe this is more of a problem for IT professionals than ordinary English
&gt;speakers.

Yes, Im aware of the communication problems this has produced over 
the years. John Sowa and I have come to an armed truce over this one, 
for example.

&gt;Bottom line is, if the development of the SUO, and perhaps more importantly
&gt;the use of the SUO, is going to extend to business people and IT
&gt;professionals who are unfamiliar with mathematical logic and its
&gt;vocabulary, there is serious risk of lack of understanding unless we are
&gt;very careful in our use of language.  I don't wish to outlaw terms which
&gt;may be useful, but plead for care in their use.  Meanwhile, I expect to
&gt;able to follow what you say, but may point out where those less familiar
&gt;than I with mathematical logic may have difficulty.

Point taken.

&gt;I will raise another potential hazard.  The way the word  Model is used in
&gt;mathematicians can appear to be the exact inverse of its natural language
&gt;meaning.

Oh yes, I know! This also has caused much anguish within cogntive 
science between logical types and psychologists, to the point where I 
personally try to avoid this word whenever possible, and will always 
call semantic structures 'interpretations' rather than 'models' (even 
though the subject-area is now labelled as 'model theory', and it is 
50 years too late to alter this.)

Best wishes

Pat Hayes
