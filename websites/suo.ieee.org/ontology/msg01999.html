&gt; Phil,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for bringing that quotation into the fray.
&gt; I believe that I am using the word "proposition"
&gt; in a way that is quite consistent with Peirce's
&gt; usage:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; "But even if it were impossible to distinguish between truth and reality,
&gt; &gt;  that would not in the least prevent our defining what it is that truth
&gt; &gt;  consists in.  Truth and falsity are characters confined to propositions.
&gt; &gt;  A proposition is a sign which separately indicates its object.
&gt; 
&gt; Peirce is explicitly saying that a proposition is a sign.
&gt; But CSP elsewhere drew a distinction between a sign instance,
&gt; such as an occurrence of the word "the", and a sign type, such
&gt; as the word "the" as the syntactic form of a sign.  Both of
&gt; them are, according to CSP, signs.

I have already pointed out that the distinction in level
of abstraction between token and type is not, in general,
something that we ought to confound with the distinction
in sign-relational role between the object and the sign.

Nor is the tone-token-type dimension relevant to the following
absolutely "typical" line of classification in Peirce's theory,
since the tone-token-type dimension cuts across the metonymous
board of this entire menu:

| Sign
|    Index
|    Icon
|    Symbol
|       Term
|       Proposition
|       Argument
|          Deduction
|          Induction
|          Abduction

You may also recall the way that I depicted these
two dimensions as being orthogonal to each other:

&gt; It is not the token-type or the instance-object-property
&gt; dimension that I am talking about here, but the object-sign
&gt; distinction.  I conventionally (my convention) think of the
&gt; first as a vertical dimension and the second as a horizontal
&gt; dimension, typically drawing pictures like this:
&gt; 
&gt; |                   . . .
&gt; |                    \|/
&gt; |               s=====s
&gt; |    q q q     /     /|\
&gt; |     \|/     /     . . .
&gt; |      o-----@
&gt; |     /|\     \     . . .
&gt; |    e e e     \     \|/
&gt; |               i=====i
&gt; |                    /|\
&gt; |                   . . .
&gt; 
&gt; This illustrates an "elementary sign relation" &lt;o, s, i&gt;, just a 3-tuple,
&gt; with "exemplars" (instances, tokens) and "qualities" (properties, types)
&gt; of each.  So the object has its place in one or many object hierarchies,
&gt; so does the sign, and so does the interpretant of the moment.  Then you
&gt; need more signs to denote the object exemplars and the object qualities,
&gt; and so it goes.  The stuff on the object side accumulates in what I like
&gt; to call an "objective framework" (OF), while the stuff on the sign side
&gt; yields an "interpretive framework" (IF).

There is only one common species of sign-theoretic situation
where the dimension from concrete to abstract becomes partly
congruent with the relationship between object and sign, and
though I am not sure, I think that this may have a little to
do with John Sowa's invoking the metonymic figures of speech
in this connexion.  This type of correlation occurs whenever
there is a "sampling" relation, because a "sample" is one of
the archetypical meanings of the Greek term "semeion", going
back to Hippocrates, where it means a "sample", a "specimen",
a medical "sign", a "symptom", a "touch", or a "trace", if I
remember all of the details correctly.  Thus being a "sample"
of a population is a special way of being a sign of an object.
But, yet again, this is not the general case of sign relations.

&gt; For my definition of meaning-preserving translation (MPT), I defined
&gt; a proposition as an equivalence class of sentences.  Each sentence, as
&gt; uttered, is a sign instance.  Each sentence as a syntactic construct is
&gt; a sign type.  My propositions are a class of sign types in one or more
&gt; languages.  That class represents the supertype of all the sign types
&gt; that have the same interpretants in all those languages.  It too is
&gt; a sign type.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thus, a portrait with the name of the original below it is a proposition.
&gt; &gt; It asserts that if anybody looks at it, he can form a reasonably correct
&gt; &gt; idea of how the original looked.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that a portrait by itself would not be a proposition
&gt; because there would be no indication of its object.

The critical element is that there would be no "independent"
indication (= index) of its object.  All by itself, it would
still be an iconic sign of its object.

&gt; The addition of the name plus the convention that a name
&gt; below a portrait indicates the name of the person portrayed
&gt; adds the necessary connection between the form (picture) and
&gt; the object (person).  That is why I require condition #3 of
&gt; vocabulary preserving in my definition of MPT.  Without that
&gt; condition, one could claim that the following three sentences
&gt; "express the same proposition":
&gt; 
&gt;  1. "Every cat is a cat."
&gt; 
&gt;  2. "Every dog is a dog."
&gt; 
&gt;  3. "Every unicorn is a unicorn."
&gt; 
&gt; All three of these sentences have the same logical form,
&gt; and all three would have the denotation true in every
&gt; possible world.  But their content words have different
&gt; referents (and "unicorn" has no referent in our world).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A sign is only a sign in actu by virtue of its
&gt; &gt; receiving an interpretation, that is, by virtue
&gt; &gt; of its determining another sign of the same object.
&gt; &gt; This is as true of mental judgments as it is of
&gt; &gt; external signs.  To say that a proposition is true
&gt; &gt; is to say that every interpretation of it is true.
&gt; &gt; Two propositions are equivalent when either
&gt; &gt; might have been an interpretant of the other.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly.  A proposition, as I defined it, is a supertype
&gt; of equivalent propositions as stated in multiple languages.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This equivalence, like others, is by an act of abstraction
&gt; &gt; (in the sense in which forming an abstract noun is abstraction)
&gt; &gt; conceived as identity.  And we speak of believing in a proposition,
&gt; &gt; having in mind an entire collection of equivalent propositions
&gt; &gt; with their partial interpretants.
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't have said it better.

Except that the way you read it,
it means something different than
than what it meant when it was writ.

&gt; &gt; Thus, two persons are said to have the same proposition in mind.
&gt; &gt; The interpretant of a proposition is itself a proposition.  Any
&gt; &gt; necessary inference from a proposition is an interpretant of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed.  That is condition #2 of proof preserving for an MPT.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When we speak of truth and falsity, we refer to the
&gt; &gt; possibility of the proposition being refuted;  and this
&gt; &gt; refutation (roughly speaking) takes place in but one way.
&gt; &gt; Namely, an interpretant of the proposition would, if believed,
&gt; &gt; produce the expectation of a certain description of percept on
&gt; &gt; a certain occasion.  The occasion arrives:  the percept forced
&gt; &gt; upon us is different.  This constitutes the falsity of every
&gt; &gt; proposition of which the disappointing prediction was the
&gt; &gt; interpretant.  Thus, a false proposition is a proposition
&gt; &gt; of which some interpretant represents that, on an occasion
&gt; &gt; which it indicates, a percept will have a certain character,
&gt; &gt; while the immediate perceptual judgment on that occasion is
&gt; &gt; that the percept has not that character.  A true proposition
&gt; &gt; is a proposition belief in which would &gt;never lead to such
&gt; &gt; disappointment so long as the proposition is not understood
&gt; &gt; otherwise than it was intended."  (CP 5.569).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I will try to remember that you talk this way.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The way I see it, however, your translation of what you
&gt; &gt; &gt; describe as "Peirce's informal statement" into formal terms
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a translation that alters significant aspects of its meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; What "significant aspects" do you claim I have altered?
&gt; Perhaps I should have been more precise in saying that
&gt; a proposition is "a supertypere" of all the sign types in
&gt; the equivalence class instead of saying that it "is" the
&gt; equivalence class.  But since a supertype of a type of s
&gt; is itself a type of s, a proposition is also a sign type.

Except for the special case that I discussed above,
where "sampling relations" amount to special cases
of sign relations, considerations of type hierachy
are not relevant to the relation of object to sign.
It is, in general, a very distinct type of relation.

&gt; I'll revise my previous definition to say that a proposition is the
&gt; supertype of all the sentence types in several different languages
&gt; that are in the same equivalence class, as determined by some MPT.

John, what you are engaging in here is a particular type of reductionism,
trying to reduce an irreducibly interpretive feature to an objective one.

That is just the way I see it.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
