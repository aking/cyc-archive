Folks,
   I hope you'll forgive a repeat of this announcement.  I know that I 
often don't get around to writing a paper until the deadline is looming and 
this one is getting close!  I hope this reminder is helpful.

Adam


Dear Colleague,
   Your participation in this workshop would be very welcome.  Our 
apologies in advance if you receive this notice more than once.


IJCAI 2001 Workshop on the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology
Note: paper submission deadline is Feb 15, 2001


      This workshop will support the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology study
      group effort. This workshop aims to make progress toward the goal of
      producing a Standard Upper Ontology. The following describes the scope
      and purpose, as determined by the study group.

      This standard will specify an upper ontology. An ontology consists of
      a set of concepts, axioms, and relationships that describe a domain of
      interest. An upper ontology is limited to concepts that are meta,
      generic, abstract and philosophical. The concepts in an upper ontology
      address all domains of interest. Each concept will have a
      specification of its meaning and a term to label it. The former
      consists of 1) a set of axioms expressed in a formal language that
      define the concept and its relationships with other concepts and 2)
      comments in natural language to aid human understanding. This ontology
      will include roughly several thousand concepts. It will provide a
      foundation for ontologies of much larger size and more specific scope,
      whose concepts can be defined, partially or completely, using concepts
      from the upper ontology.

         o The standard will be suitable for automated logical inference to
           support knowledge-based reasoning applications.
         o Since this ontology could be mapped to more restricted forms such
           as XML, database schema, or object oriented schema, this will
           enable developers of databases and other software applications to
           define new data elements in terms of a common ontology, and
           thereby gain some degree of interoperability with other
           conformant systems.
         o Owners of existing systems will be able to map existing data
           elements just once to a common ontology, and thereby gain a
           degree of interoperability with other representations that
           conform to SUO.
         o Domain-specific ontologies that are compliant with this standard
           will be able to interoperate (to some degree) by virtue of the
           shared common terms and definitions.
         o Applications of the ontology will include:
             1. E-commerce applications from different domains that need to
                interoperate at both the data and semantic levels.
             2. Educational applications in which students learn concepts
                and relationships directly from, or expressed in terms of, a
                common ontology. This will also enable a standard record of
                learning to be kept.
             3. Natural language understanding tasks in which a knowledge
                based reasoning system uses the ontology to disambiguate
                among likely interpretations of natural language
                statements.interpretations of natural language statements.

      Why and to whom the workshop is of interest

      This workshop will bring together Computer Scientists, Philosophers,
      Linguists and others interested in formal ontology. It will provide an
      opportunity for participants in the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology study
      group to convene in person and make progress on this standards effort.
      It will provide an opportunity for a broader membership of the AI
      community to have impact on this standards effort. The
      interdisciplinary nature of this effort should have a direct and
      positive impact on work in Artificial Intelligence.

       Workshop:                      August 4-6, 2001

      Paper Submission Guidelines

      Participants will be asked to review the SUO material, including
      previous discussions, language syntax and semantics and the proposed
      content of the standard to date. Participants should address either
      additions which build on the proposed standard, or concrete proposed
      changes which are intended to revise and improve it.

      Topics covered will include formal theories of semiotics, mereology,
      causality, modality, temporal ontology and contexts. Participants will
      be asked to address issues of formal content rather than techniques
      for logical computation. Participants will be asked to state any
      formal content of their papers consistently with regard to the
      language and upper level content provided at the SUO web site.

      An ideal paper, for example, would present an ontology of semiotics
      stated in SUO-KIF. The paper would discuss the relation of the
      ontology to previous work by Eco, and Pierce. It would provide
      examples in the real world of difficult semiotic issues and how the
      examples would be represented in SUO-KIF and the semiotics ontology
      proposed in the paper.

      Papers should be 10 pages or less and conform to AAAI format. PDF
      submissions are preferred but MSWord, and Postscript are also
      acceptable.

      Related workshops

      IJCAI 2001 Workshops

      There is another IJCAI proposal for a workshop on "Ontologies and
      Information Sharing" that is highly compatible with this workshop.
      Other related proposal topics of which we are aware include
      "E-Business and the Intelligent Web", "Ontology Learning" and
      "Knowledge Management"

      We would be interested in having a one day session on the IEEE
      standardization effort, the agenda for which is proposed below, and
      then a one day joint session with these related workshops.

      Past Workshops

      IJCAI-99 Workshop KRR-5: Ontologies and Problem-Solving Methods:
      Lessons Learned and Future Trends - Addressed how problem solving
      methods and ontologies cna support each other. Did not address
      fundamental issues in upper ontologies, standardization or relevance
      of issues in logical philosophy.

      IJCAI-97 Ontologies and Multilingual NLP: Addressed how ontologies can
      support natural language processing. While a goal of the SUO effort,
      NLP is one goal of many and not a central focus.
