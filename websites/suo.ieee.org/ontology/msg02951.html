Kevin,

Older material is tagged.
Novelty is unindentional.

Kevin Johnson wrote (KJ):
Jon Awbrey wrote (JA):

KJ: You generally attack the paradox 'information theoretically'
    (holding 'time' 'constant' (as a pivot of reason) and
    allowing 'space' to 'vary').

JA: Here I do not understand your language, in particular:

JA: 1.  &quot;attack the paradox&quot; -- I see no paradox to attack.

KJ: It seems then that you have said a great deal about what you don’t see.

I am talking about many things that I see.
There is a patch of text that some people
describe as a &quot;paradox&quot;.  I guess that
they mean a logical aporia, antinomy,
or other sort of insolubilium by it.
But I do not describe it that way,
as it does not seem to deserve
the title of &quot;paradox&quot; in so
exalted a sense, being a not
too original syntact that
has but the property of
deceiving the eyes into
a mistaken reading.
So I would call it
an &quot;illusion&quot;, if
it comes to that.

KJ: This isn’t just a tweak, BTW;
    related to differing senses
    of ‘negation’.

I am a classic case, and know no other not.
Not in this case, what's ZOL there is here.

JA: 2.  &quot;information theoretically&quot; -- I am interested in the integral
        interweave of indication, inference, information, and inquiry,
        but I am not invoking any specifically &quot;information theoretic&quot;
        issues at the present juncture.

KJ: I am glad that we have common interests.
    I use the term “information theoretic”
    because when I began to study examples
    of it, the shift in argument pivot
    ‘jumped out’ at me.  It seems to me,
    perhaps idiosyncratically, to be the
    best collective descriptor of this shift.
    ‘Logic’ and ‘information theory’ are actually
    (to me) quite jumbled mixtures of reasoning shifts
    but I feel the dichotomy pragmatically reflects the
    predominance of one manner of shift over another.

JA: 3.  &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot; -- I do not see these as relevant dimensions
        in the present, almost purely &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;semiotic&quot; concerns.

KJ: I do not deny that “purely “logical” and “semiotic” concerns
    may go beyond ‘space’ and ‘time’, I simply point out that
    formal human comprehension/expression of them seems
    restricted to them and in particular ways.

It is true that creatures such as we -- well, I should not presume on you,
but I am pretty sure about the lion's share of me, anyway -- live and talk
in spacetime.  Is that what you mean?  But can we not abstract for a' that?

JA: 4.  &quot;pivot of reason&quot; -- ???

KJ: That which you reason from.

I reason from premisses.
Is that what you mean?

KJ: 'Information theoretic' arguments are equipotent with 'logical' arguments
    (though the proponent of one or another particular instantiation may be
    unwilling to grant this at some particular moment in time ;-).

JA: Again, I am only talking logic, maybe a bit of semiotic.

KJ: ‘Logic’ also uses ‘information theoretic’ shifts;
    semiotic as well.

Okay, I will concede that one,
modulo my inability to grasp
what you mean by &quot;shifts&quot;,
or why they are revelant.

JA: I am not sure I get what you are saying here --
    my analysis of this particular problem shows
    that a fast one has been pulled, and that no
    anomaly actually arises, if the eye is quick
    enough to catch it before the initial action --
    but what you say reminds me of the old theme
    from Charles Sanders Peirce, of late revived
    by George Spencer Brown, that nothing in the
    world says we cannot invent imaginary values
    in logic that will act in analogue to values
    of that ilk already familiar in mathematics.

KJ: I am just saying that it is possible for ‘logical’ and ‘information theoretic’
    arguments to attack oneanother with equal warrant under formal human reason.

JA: Again, I do not understand this talk of arguments attacking one another.

KJ: Debate, for example.

Has it come to that?

KJ: I am subsuming a spatio-temporal universe of discourse
    to yield ‘space’ and ‘time’ as pivots of reason.

This seems to weigh against my &quot;hypothetical interpretive conjecture&quot; (HIC),
lately tendered, that your &quot;pivot&quot; is my &quot;premiss&quot;.  Next guess:  Are you
maybe talking about a &quot;condition of possibility&quot; (COP), a la Kant?

KJ: This is simply a pragmatic acknowledgment of the primary stature of
    these ‘dimensions’ in philosophy, mathematics, etc.  [Other lists have
    people discussing ‘time’ ostensibly without using ‘time’.  I don’t have
    a difficulty with that because it simply adds another pivot for formal
    reason.]

JA: This is the same language that I did not understand the first time.

KJ: I wish I knew a better way to express/convey it.
    It seems to be something I must circle around to
    indicate and use ‘quotes’ with to show that the
    word is not quite right somehow.  

KJ: The ‘catching of a fast one’ is a process that can spiral
    indefinitely though what appears to happen is the two sides
    wearying of the battle/inquiry and moving on to another topic.
    This may or may not result in statements like “the majority of
    rational people agree that ____” or “the majority of logicians
    agree that _____.”

All my friends agree that ____.

KJ: Per Peirce and Brown, I would only remember that
    our formal understanding of what mathematics is,
    is also limited -– in my opinion.

JA: It is limited.  It is not zero.

KJ: Depends on how you look at it.  ‘Zero’ -– what is that?

Alternative Interpretant:  &quot;It is limited.  It is not to be neglected.&quot;

KJ: A ‘fast one’ would be to ascribe to an incomplete understanding/conception
    of mathematics the position of ultimate arbiter, i.e. smuggling in the very
    limitations it presumes to judge.

...

JA: And what the heck does this dot.comment say?
    It is inducing you to accept this identity:
    |
    | &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Statement 1 is false&quot;.
    |
    That appears to be a purely syntactic indexing,
    the sort of thing you are led to believe that
    you can do arbitrarily, with logical impunity.

KJ: Logic's metalanguage relies on this same impunity.  Pot calling the kettle black.

JA: I think not.

KJ: We are discussing it, are we not?

JA: I do not understand what you are saying here.
    Perhaps it would help if I rephrase my claim:

JA: | Just here, to wit, where it is writ:
    | |
    | | 1.  Statement 1 is false.
    | |
    | What is this really saying?
    | Well, it's the same as writing:
    | |
    | | Statement 1.  Statement 1 is false.
    | |
    | And what the heck does this dot.comment say?
    | It is inducing you to accept this identity:
    | | 
    | | &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Statement 1 is false&quot;.
    | | 
    | That appears to be a purely syntactic indexing,
    | the sort of thing you are led to believe that
    | you can do arbitrarily, with logical impunity.

JA: People seem to think that the mere listing, naming,
    or numbering of logical expressions are operations
    that have no logical consequences, as if they fell
    outside the jurisdiction of logical laws, and must
    be innocent of any offense against reason, however
    they operate, and no matter how they are conducted.
    That would amount to a &quot;purely syntactic indexing&quot;,
    executable willy nilly, or with &quot;logical impunity&quot;.
    But semiotics is the ground over which logic walks,
    so a fault in semiotics makes for a quake in logic.

KJ: People seem to think that the mere listing, naming,
    or numbering of ‘space’ and/or ‘time’ are operations
    that have no logical consequences, as if they fell
    outside the jurisdiction of logical laws, and must
    be innocent of any offense against reason, however
    they operate, and no matter how they are conducted.

I have to admit that what you intone here has the naggingly
familiar sound of something approaching brilliance about it,
but ...

KJ: Odd as it may seem, I am hoping that formal human reason
    can be made ‘more’ consistent.  But I also recognize that
    these limitations may be characteristic of our species and
    what ‘we’ consider/accept-as ‘normal’.

JA: [Quoting]
    |
    | &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Negation of Statement 1&quot;

KJ: This also touches on the underlying ambiguity of 'negation' in
    reasoning.  A difficulty for hereditary warrants of consistency.

JA: I am classical.
    Negation is my middle name.
    It's just not that big a deal.

KJ: The foundational ambiguity of a primary logical operator is of some concern to me.

JA: Be not afraid.
    There is no ambiguity to speak of here.

KJ: We just look at things differently, I guess.

JA: To write the last step in the form that I like:
    |
    | (( Statement_1 , ( Statement_1 ) ))
    |
    And this my friends, call it &quot;Statement 0&quot;,
    is purely and simply a false statement,
    with no hint of paradox about it.

JA: Statement 0 was slipped into your drink
    before you were even starting to think.
    A bit before you were led to substitute
    you should have examined more carefully
    the site proposed for the substitution!

JA: For the principle that you rushed to use
    does not permit you to substitute unequals
    into a statement that is false to begin with,
    not just in the first place, but even before,
    in the zeroth place of argument, as it were,
    and still expect to come up with a truth.

KJ: The argument can also be made that you used this same device to argue against itself.

JA: I think not.
    I am pointing to a very simple mistake.
    Substituting into a false statement just
    cannot be guaranteed to create any truth.

KJ: I think this situation is common enough to have its own principle: charity.

JA: Is it charity to leave a person locked
    in anxious chains of their own forging?

KJ: Very similar to my perspective -– difficult question/dilemma.
    Maybe replace “anxious” with ‘blissful’.

Yes, it is the polite thing to leave the lovers to their loves.
But Paradox is a much harsher mystress than Moon or e'en Maths.

KJ: You interpret the paradox uncharitably.

JA: There is no paradox to interpret.

JA: T^2:  &quot;What's love got to do with it?&quot;

KJ: And with that, we all disappeared with a “pop!” 

KJ: “Come along if you dare…”

KJ: It is easy to see why such statements are/were brushed aside
    with terms like 'non-sensical'.  Confronting them illuminates
    disturbing limitations in formal reasoning.

JA: As long as you take the statement &quot;S = Not S&quot; to be false,
    and just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic,
    you cannot imagine any substitution for S to make it true.

KJ: ‘any substitution for S’

JA: &quot;just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic&quot;

KJ: I think you mean a conception of classical logic
    wherein paradoxes cannot be spoken of.  Certainly
    not the classical logic you have been currently
    using to speak of/about paradoxes.

No, I mean the 'Classic' classical logic.
It has axioms that can be recast like so:

1.  ((A, A)),  Identity.
2.  (A, (A)),  Excluded Middle.
3.  (A  (A)),  Non-Contradiction.

For the other hemisphere:

|    A   A            A          A
|    o---o            o          o
|     \ /         A   |          |
|      o          o---o        A o
|      |           \ /           |
|      @            @            @
|
|   ((A, A))     (A, (A))     (A  (A))
|
|   Figure 1.    Figure 2.    Figure 3.

Of course, out of respect for the classics,
I employed a lot of the logical redundants.

KJ: I have a fairly good imagination.

JA: So?  How does that apply here?

KJ: It has to do with the ‘borders’ whereon a paradox sits.  Does the border belong
    to its interior (set) or exterior (complement)?   Both answers are consistent.

If there are genuine paradoxes, they may have borders, I guess.
But the present case is a simple illusion, and a simple error,
and no good can come of mystiquing it, no more than admitting
the equation &quot;2 = 3&quot; to ordinary arithmetic.

KJ: Note also that you wish to explicitly inject 'variance' of 'time'
    into an argument that depends upon a warrant of consistency at a
    single moment in 'time', i.e., you wish to establish a temporal
    ordering of events upon which the principle can take hold.

JA: I do not recall doing any such thing.
    Can you point to where I &quot;explicitly
    inject 'variance' of 'time'&quot; within
    the original discussion?

KJ: You desire your substitutions in the original ‘problem’ to be considered
    each in their turn, but also simultaneously (single moment in time):

JA: [Quothe quoting the poser]
    |
    | Just here, to wit, where it is writ:
    | |
    | | 1.  Statement 1 is false.
    | |
    | What is this really saying?
    | Well, it's the same as writing:
    | |
    | | Statement 1.  Statement 1 is false.
    | |
    | And what the heck does this dot.comment say?
    | It is inducing you to accept this identity:
    | | 
    | | &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Statement 1 is false&quot;.

No, you have me confused with the other,
the confused one, the one who asks us
to substitute into a false statement
and treat it like a truth.  I know
that it can often take a program
to tell the players apart, but
you may know me as the one who
is saying &quot;No, don't do that!&quot;

KJ: You illuminate a/the weakness of 'logical' arguments.

JA: As opposed to the strength of illogical arguments?

KJ: You just utilize the ‘variance’ available to argue for your desired position.

...

KJ: To me, the important thing is to recognize that human formal reasoning has limitations.

JA: It has its peculiar limitations.  But that does not make it non-existent.
    It would become useless if arguments from false premisses are encouraged.

KJ: If I didn’t believe it was useful I would have long ago been consumed
    in Pyrrhic flames (it was a close call).  It is more disturbing, I think,
    to confront the “false premisses” that appear to be generated and sustained
    by our human psychology.  Arguments of (appeals to) absurdity carry great weight.

Yes, but illusions are like that, whether of sense or of intellect, all the same way.

KJ: You need to 'step back' from the circularity and see that for what it is.

JA: There is no circularity here.
    It is a simple logical error.

KJ: Again, I acknowledge that it can be interpreted that way and usefully too.

KJ: There is value in exploring and developing arabesques and paths within that circle --
    I have no doubt-of/qualms-with that -- but I think there is danger in hypostatizing
    its universe of discourse 'universally' outside the circle of application (claiming
    its complement might be a way to look at -- this reminds me that I saw an expression
    for the axiom of infinity that essentially/explicitly uses this notion of claiming
    its complement).

JA: It's simply a matter of economy in ammunition:
    Elephant guns are not needed to swat this bug.

KJ: Danger comes in packages large and small.   

JA: There is a passel of mystification in packaging.
    But there be rules about truth in animadverting.

KJ: Revisit H. G. Wells’ “War of the Worlds.”

Is that where the aliens die of influence?
Or was it the prospective anxiety thereof?
