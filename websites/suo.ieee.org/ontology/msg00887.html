&gt; Subject: RE: SUO: Proposed Changes to Merged Ontology
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The proposed changes are as follows.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;1.  Simplify the tip of the ontology so that it has the
&gt; &gt; &gt; following structure.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Certainly this simplification is a great improvement, but 
&gt; it retains
&gt; &gt; &gt; many of the most worrisome and misleading confusions of 
&gt; the original.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Individual Entity)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Relation Entity)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The continuant/occurrent distinction, while popular, has many
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. Many things can be seen in either way, and 
&gt; indeed for many
&gt; &gt; &gt; ordinary reasoning processes *must* be thought of in both ways: an
&gt; &gt; &gt; ocean wave and a flame are two of my favorite examples, but others
&gt; &gt; &gt; include weather phenomena, many chemical and biochemical 
&gt; processes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and various dynamic aspects of working industrial machinery
&gt; &gt; &gt; (especially those involving moving liquids, such as combustion or
&gt; &gt; &gt; hydraulics). If we are forced into a rigorous high-level 
&gt; distinction
&gt; &gt; &gt; between 'things' and 'processes' as mutually exlcusive, 
&gt; then this in
&gt; &gt; &gt; turn forces our practical ontologies to make many artificial
&gt; &gt; &gt; distinctions which just get in the damned way, eg between a
&gt; &gt; &gt; cloud-as-a-thing and a cloud-as-a-process, or between things and
&gt; &gt; &gt; their lifetimes in a 4-d ontology. There is no need to do 
&gt; this, other
&gt; &gt; &gt; than to satisfy a rather naive philosophical doctrine 
&gt; which is based
&gt; &gt; &gt; on very shaky linguistic intuitions.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, we could distinguish ContinuantType from OccurrentType 
&gt; in much the
&gt; &gt;same way that Cyc distinguishes StuffType from ObjectType - 
&gt; ContinuantType
&gt; &gt;would be a class containing all the classes of continuants 
&gt; and OccurrentType
&gt; &gt;would be a class containing all the classes of occurrents.  
&gt; The advantage of
&gt; &gt;this sort of structure is that it allows us to maintain the 
&gt; disjointness of
&gt; &gt;the high-level classes - there is no overlap between 
&gt; ContinuantType and
&gt; &gt;OccurrentType.  Furthermore, we can accomodate the 
&gt; observation that some
&gt; &gt;things are, e.g., process-like in some respects and 
&gt; object-like in others.
&gt; &gt;Furthermore, this approach would embody your general 
&gt; suggestion above about
&gt; &gt;categorizing aspects of things rather than things 
&gt; themselves, since classes
&gt; &gt;(or ways of describing things) are categorized as 
&gt; continuants/occurrents,
&gt; &gt;rather than the things themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, this would be an improvement and would be workable, but I think 
&gt; it isnt terribly helpful. At least it should be possible to have 
&gt; classes that are in neither category.
&gt; 
&gt; In the other message I sent you about temporal formalisms I noted how 
&gt; the occurrent/continuant distinction can be thought of as two ways of 
&gt; splitting a 4d thing into pieces. If we regard Types as 
&gt; classifications of predicates into those that assume one or another 
&gt; kind of 'part' divisions (temporal or spatial) then I think this will 
&gt; be the most useful way to think about them. Thus for example a 
&gt; Continuant-Type predicate would have the property that it if is true 
&gt; of something with a temporal extent and if it is inherited by 
&gt; parthood, then it will be true for all the spatial parts of the thing 
&gt; during that interval; an Occurrent-Type predicate would be inherited, 
&gt; on the other hand, by temporal parts. Examples might be respectively 
&gt; being made of a certain material, and happening in a certain place.

OK, if I understand you here, you are not objecting to the
OccurrentType/ContinuantType distinction; you're objecting to the
disjointness condition on these classes.  Furthermore, you're proposing that
we define axioms on these two classes regarding the inheritance of
properties.  Specifically, we would have axioms like the following:

(=&gt;
     (and
     	    (instance-of ?X ContinuantType)
          (instance-of ?Y ?X) 
          (spatial-part-of ?Z ?Y))
     (instance-of ?Z ?X))

(=&gt;
     (and
     	    (instance-of ?X OccurrentType)
          (instance-of ?Y ?X) 
          (temporal-part-of ?Z ?Y))
     (instance-of ?Z ?X))

Am I understanding you right?  If so, the first axiom seems plausible to me,
but the second does not.  For example, 'Walking' (understood as the class of
all walking events) would presumably be an instance of OccurrentType.
Furthermore, a particular walking event of mine might cover the distance
between Union Square and the Embarcadero (I live in San Francisco).
However, no part of this particular walking event will cover this entire
distance, and, thus, no proper part of the event will have one property
which is possessed by the event as a whole.  This seems like an obvious
counterexample, so maybe I'm missing something in your proposal.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Object Physical)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Process Physical)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a serious problem with the following (I was 
&gt; preparing a longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; document about this, but I can cover the essential point in this
&gt; &gt; &gt; message:)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Schema Abstract)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This conflation of 'abstract' and 'continuant' doesn't 
&gt; seem to make
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense. An 'abstract' is something which stands outside 
&gt; time: it has
&gt; &gt; &gt; no temporal aspect or dependence at all; it doesnt even 
&gt; make sense to
&gt; &gt; &gt; ask temporal questions about it.  (From the Sowa 
&gt; explanation: " Forms
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical 
&gt; objects such
&gt; &gt; &gt; as sets and relations, but instances of forms cannot exist at a
&gt; &gt; &gt; particular place and time without some physical encoding or
&gt; &gt; &gt; embodiment. Whitehead called them "eternal objects" 
&gt; because they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; independent of space and time." )
&gt; &gt; &gt; But a continuant is defined to be something that retains 
&gt; its identity
&gt; &gt; &gt; during some time-interval. (Sowa again: "A continuant is an entity
&gt; &gt; &gt; whose identity continues to be recognizable over some extended
&gt; &gt; &gt; interval of time." )
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So this notion of 'schema' seems incoherent; and since a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather important stuff is classified under it, none of that makes
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense either. This seems to me to be the single most central
&gt; &gt; &gt; conceptual bug in the entire scheme, and one that must be repaired
&gt; &gt; &gt; before the ontology can be of any real use.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Similar objections apply to "Script", for the same reason, since
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'occurrent' means something that has a temporal location.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, if the "incoherence" of the subclassing of 'Schema' 
&gt; and 'Script' is
&gt; &gt;the "single most central conceptual bug" in the merged 
&gt; ontology, that's good
&gt; &gt;news, because I think it can be fairly easily debugged.  
&gt; What if we just
&gt; &gt;replace the concept 'Abstract' by 'Informational Object' or
&gt; &gt;'ContentBearingObject' or some such notion?
&gt; 
&gt; Well fine, but where do all the really abstract things go? With this 
&gt; change, *everything* is physical.

No, if we define 'ContentBearingThing' as suggested below, then we still
have a place in the ontology for things which aren't physical, because we
still have the concept of 'Abstract'.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Then we would have the
&gt; &gt;following relationships in the merged ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of SchemaObject ContentBearingObject)
&gt; &gt;(instance-of SchemaObject ContinuantType)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of ScriptObject ContentBearingObject)
&gt; &gt;(instance-of ScriptObject OccurrentType)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Note that 'Schema' and 'Script' have been replaced by 
&gt; 'SchemaObject' and
&gt; &gt;'ScriptObject', since we are now concerned with the things 
&gt; that embody
&gt; &gt;schemas and scripts, as construed by Sowa.  Note too that 
&gt; the relationship
&gt; &gt;between 'SchemaObject' and 'ContinuantType' and between 
&gt; 'ScriptObject' and
&gt; &gt;'OccurrentType' is 'instance-of', rather than 'subclass-of'. 
&gt;  Finally, note
&gt; &gt;that 'ContentBearingObject' could be defined as follows, using Sowa's
&gt; &gt;original high-level notions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of ContentBearingObject Abstract)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of ContentBearingObject Object)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;At least we could do this as long as we're willing to concede that an
&gt; &gt;informational object is both a physical object and an 
&gt; abstract form (in some
&gt; &gt;sense).
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmm. Its not a *pairing* of a physical object and an abstract form, 
&gt; to be sure. But in any case sometimes we might want to actually refer 
&gt; to the genuine abstract form, eg I have a little ontology of shapes 
&gt; which treats a shape as an abstract first-class entity, so that one 
&gt; can literally say that two things have the same shape. Where do I put 
&gt; the shapes of my information-bearing objects?

These shapes would still go under 'Abstract', as long as we retain this
concept.

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;....
&gt; &gt; &gt; A noble ambition, but I doubt if it can be done. These are, after
&gt; &gt; &gt; all, philosophical distinctions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hmmm...  I guess I tend to think that anything worthwhile in 
&gt; philosophy can
&gt; &gt;be explained to non-philosophers, just as I think important 
&gt; results in
&gt; &gt;physics, chemistry, biology, etc. can be cashed out i a way 
&gt; that makes sense
&gt; &gt;to the layman.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it depends on the layman. Im *still* trying to 
&gt; understand quantum theory.

I suspect that's because parts of quantum theory are conceptually
incoherent.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Certainly these revisions don't cut
&gt; &gt; &gt; it; and in fact I don't think they really make sense, in places.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The revised docu-strings follow.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Abstract "Pure information as 
&gt; distinguished from any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;particular encoding of the information in a physical medium.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is potentially misleading to refer to 'information' 
&gt; here. I doubt
&gt; &gt; &gt; if many philosophers of mathematics or even working mathematicians
&gt; &gt; &gt; would agree that the integers, for example, consisted of 
&gt; information.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose an engineer were to ask, reasonably enough, how many bytes
&gt; &gt; &gt; were needed to encode the platonic ideal sphere?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, we don't really need the concept of 'Abstract' if we 
&gt; replace it with
&gt; &gt;something like 'ContentBearingThing' as suggested above.  
&gt; However, if we do
&gt; &gt;decide to retain it (e.g. for the purpose of defining
&gt; &gt;'ContentBearingThing'), how about we use the following docu-sting?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Abstract "Properties or qualities as 
&gt; distinguished from any
&gt; &gt;particular embodiment of the properties/qualities in a 
&gt; physical medium.")
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, a lot better. Might add that Abstracts are *not* located in time 
&gt; or space, just to rub the point home, and give numbers as an example.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instances of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Abstract can be said to exist in the same sense as
&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematical objects
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, the term 'mathematical object' is potentially misleading.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;such
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;as sets and relations, but they cannot exist at a particular
&gt; &gt; &gt; place and time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;without some physical encoding or embodiment.")
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do
&gt; &gt; &gt; not have spatial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, grammars, 
&gt; and the data
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;structures of computer science.  All the syntactic forms 
&gt; in natural
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;languages, programming languages, and versions of 
&gt; symbolic logic are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;included under Arrangement.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I honestly do not follow this. In my world, the forms of 
&gt; a language
&gt; &gt; &gt; DO have spatial dimensions. The notion of a font size makes sense,
&gt; &gt; &gt; for example, and data structures occupy physical memory. 
&gt; Linguistic
&gt; &gt; &gt; forms are not mathematical abstractions (which is why the 
&gt; type/token
&gt; &gt; &gt; contrast makes sense.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, how about we use the following docu-string instead?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do 
&gt; not have spatial
&gt; &gt;dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, formal grammars, 
&gt; logics, and the
&gt; &gt;data structures of computer science.")
&gt; 
&gt; I still find it odd. The problem isnt the words, its the idea. Data 
&gt; structures *are* physical. They take up RAM, you can almost weigh 
&gt; them. Maybe 'abstract data structures' arent physical, but then they 
&gt; aren't inside computers either.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess this classification, to me, either doesnt make sense, or isnt 
&gt; clearly separable from Abstract.

I agree that we need to provide a clear set of differentiae for Arrangement.
I'll work on doing this, and, of course, any input from John Sowa on this
point would be welcome.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And why say only that mathematical abstractions don't 
&gt; have *spatial*
&gt; &gt; &gt; dimensions? They also don't have temporal dimensions, or physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; attributes, etc.; in fact there is quite a lot that they 
&gt; don't have.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But there's a deeper problem here in any case. This 
&gt; notion reflects a
&gt; &gt; &gt; particular philosophy of mathematics which , while it is popular
&gt; &gt; &gt; among pure mathematicians, isn't very useful in the real world. On
&gt; &gt; &gt; this view, mathematics talks about a purely platonic world of
&gt; &gt; &gt; "mathematical objects", in contrast to the physical world. I think
&gt; &gt; &gt; this is a popular but fundamental mistake: mathematics in 
&gt; fact talks
&gt; &gt; &gt; about anything, and this abstract 'platonic' world is a 
&gt; fictional way
&gt; &gt; &gt; of refusing to commit oneself as to what particular thing one is
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about. Take the natural numbers, for example. 
&gt; When a shepherd
&gt; &gt; &gt; stands counting his sheep, is he in fact talking about an abstract
&gt; &gt; &gt; world of numbers which is in 1:1 correspondence with his 
&gt; sheep? No:
&gt; &gt; &gt; he is talking about his sheep, and counting *them*. The 
&gt; philosophical
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to postulate a world of 'pure numbers' arises when 
&gt; one wants to
&gt; &gt; &gt; analyse the act of counting 'in the abstract', ie unencumbered by
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying what particular things are being counted. But most of our
&gt; &gt; &gt; ontologizing in practice is going to be about actual things; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; sheep, not integers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, once again I think we need to bear in mind what we're 
&gt; trying to do here.
&gt; &gt;We're not trying to formulate a fully adequate theory of the 
&gt; universe; we're
&gt; &gt;trying to construct an engineering artifact.  It may be the case that
&gt; &gt;Platonic forms don't exist (I for one don't believe in 
&gt; them), but that
&gt; &gt;doesn't negate the fact that Arrangement is a useful category - just
&gt; &gt;consider all of the examples given in the docu-string.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, OK. I give up on this one.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation CaseRole "The class of predicates relating
&gt; &gt; &gt; the spatially
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;distinguished parts of an occurrent. Case roles include the
&gt; &gt; &gt; agent, patient
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or recipient of an action, the flammable substance in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; burning process, or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the water that falls in rain.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another useless category. 'case role' is a LINGUISTIC idea, not an
&gt; &gt; &gt; ontological one. (And it is only meaningful within one approach to
&gt; &gt; &gt; describing linguistic structure which in any case isn't in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical mainstream.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; More generally, almost all the categorisations in this 
&gt; ontology which
&gt; &gt; &gt; depend on the occurrent/continuant distinction are fundamentally
&gt; &gt; &gt; linguistic rather than ontological. They reflect ways of *talking*
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the world, rather than ways the world in fact is. Since the
&gt; &gt; &gt; very same thing can often - usually - be described as either a
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuant or an occurrent, these pseudo-categories reflect an
&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude rather than an objective structure. For example, take the
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'water that falls in rain' example (which ought really to say the
&gt; &gt; &gt; *drops* of water that fall in rain). If a rain is an event (or
&gt; &gt; &gt; process) then the raindrops might be said to be its spatial parts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but then they could also be the spatial parts of the rainstorm
&gt; &gt; &gt; considered as a continuant (rainstorms retain their 
&gt; identity through
&gt; &gt; &gt; time, and even move across the landscape at measurable velocities.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some rainstorms even have been given proper names.); and moreover,
&gt; &gt; &gt; since a raindrop is falling, it can itself be considered to be an
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurrent, which is a part (in a different 'subprocess' 
&gt; sense) of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; larger occurrent, and also a part (in yet another sense, if we are
&gt; &gt; &gt; forced into making the high-level distinction between things and
&gt; &gt; &gt; processes) of a continuant. In fact, one can take almost any
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasonably well-defined and connected chunk of space-time 
&gt; and split
&gt; &gt; &gt; it into pieces along spacelike boundaries (to get 'case roles') or
&gt; &gt; &gt; along time-like boundaries (to get some other category of 
&gt; 'pieces') ,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but one can also split it along other, more complex, planes of
&gt; &gt; &gt; division. If some piece of a machine starts to move, one can split
&gt; &gt; &gt; the space-time of the machine so as to focus on, say, the leading
&gt; &gt; &gt; edge of the moving part during the movement (is this an 
&gt; occurrent or
&gt; &gt; &gt; a continuant? Why should I give a damn?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, once again I think you are failing to bear in mind the 
&gt; engineering
&gt; &gt;perspective that we have to assume if we're going to get 
&gt; anything done here.
&gt; &gt;I know philosophers like to while away the hours wondering 
&gt; about whether
&gt; &gt;something is a merely linguistic categorization as opposed 
&gt; to a marker along
&gt; &gt;the noumenal contours of the world, but this shouldn't have 
&gt; any bearing
&gt; &gt;here.  We're trying to create a conceptual schema that, 
&gt; among other things,
&gt; &gt;promotes interoperability among information systems.  A linguistic
&gt; &gt;categorization may only reflect an "attitude", as you put 
&gt; it.  However, if
&gt; &gt;an attitude is culturally embedded (that is, if a large 
&gt; community assume
&gt; &gt;this attitude in their communications with one another), it 
&gt; matters a lot to
&gt; &gt;the culture, and, hence, it will probably matter a lot to 
&gt; the information
&gt; &gt;systems that they construct.  Therefore, a conceptual schema 
&gt; that does not
&gt; &gt;incorporate the categorization corresponding to this attitute will be
&gt; &gt;crippled in this respect.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, but that argument cuts both ways. What engineering culture uses 
&gt; case roles centrally? BTW, most of my ontological intuitions arise 
&gt; from trying to formalize the physical world rather than doing 
&gt; philosophy. I spend more time restoring houses and fixing mechanical 
&gt; clocks than I do whiling away any hours with noumenal contours. Thats 
&gt; exactly why I want the SUO classifications to reflect reality rather 
&gt; than linguistic or textual categories.

Well, I'm not just concerned with "engineering cultures".  We need to be
attentive to any culture that is or could be modelled by engineers in
developing information systems that permit members of the culture to perform
certain tasks more efficiently/effectively.  For example, the subject
classification scheme used by an information retrieval system (e.g. a
bibliographic database) had better reflect the world as the culture sees it,
as their attitudes present it, or however you want to put it.  If the system
restricts itself to a set of scientific categories, then it's not going to
be of much value to society at large.  As for the particular example of case
roles, we do, I think, in our day-to-day interactions with the world think
and speak of things as agents, patients, recipients, etc.  Accordingly, an
information extraction system that does not employ this same stock of
categories is not going to be very useful when it comes to extracting
information from, e.g., newswire text.  

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation ComponentRelation "An umbrella class for any
&gt; &gt; &gt; binary relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that relates an Object to an aspect of that object.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; three elements of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ComponentRelation are part-of, property-of, and stage-of.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What on earth does that mean? What is an aspect? (What isn't an
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspect, better question.) How can a binary relation have three
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'elements'?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, ComponentRelation is a class of binary relations.  
&gt; This does not imply
&gt; &gt;that ComponentRelation itself is a binary relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I see. You are saying that there are only three 
&gt; ComponentRelations?!? Hardly seems worth having a class this high in 
&gt; the ontology with only three things in it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Furthermore, I don't
&gt; &gt;understand your objection to "aspect" here.  You began this 
&gt; response by
&gt; &gt;arguing that we *ought* to categorize aspects of things 
&gt; rather than things
&gt; &gt;themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry. Let me rephrase the question: what do YOU mean by 'aspect' 
&gt; here? I know what I meant by it, but it was a technical usage which 
&gt; is why I used scare-quotes.

I mean a spatial, temporal or qualitative element of an object.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is an entity 
&gt; whose identity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;continues to be recognizable over some extended interval 
&gt; of time.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a very poor definition, by the way, since almost 
&gt; *anything*
&gt; &gt; &gt; physical has an identity which extends over *some* period of time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, it is a mistake to introduce the essentially 
&gt; epistemic notion
&gt; &gt; &gt; of 'recognizable' into what ought to be a clearly non-epistemic
&gt; &gt; &gt; notion. The classical definition of continuant is 
&gt; something which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; such that all its parts are wholly present whenever it is present,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which means essentially that its parts are considered to 
&gt; be spatial
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than temporal. So a human body, say, is a 
&gt; continuant, while a
&gt; &gt; &gt; race or a football match are not, since they have temporal 'parts'
&gt; &gt; &gt; like beginnings and endings or first and second halves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, I like your suggested way of reformulating the comment.
&gt; 
&gt; I learned it from Peter Simons.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If no one has
&gt; &gt;any objection, I'll replace the version above with the one below.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is any entity whose 
&gt; parts are wholly
&gt; &gt;present whenever it is present.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; indefinitely divisible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the limits of perception by the available sense organs 
&gt; or measuring
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;instruments.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; How do we classify things which are partly continuous and 
&gt; partly not?
&gt; &gt; &gt; (You know, like almost any complicated piece of 
&gt; machinery, say; or a
&gt; &gt; &gt; company, for example.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, it is poor strategy to introduce epistemic notions like
&gt; &gt; &gt; perception into the explanation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Again, I understand that you philosophers are very prudish about the
&gt; &gt;epistemological/metaphysical distinction, and that's fine - 
&gt; every discipline
&gt; &gt;has its sacred cows.  However, I don't see that we have to 
&gt; be similarly
&gt; &gt;circumspect in this context.  .....
&gt; 
&gt; What was bothering me was that the notion itself wasn't epistemic (I 
&gt; think) but that the English documentation used an epistemic notion, 
&gt; which is likely to be misleading. If that really is what you want the 
&gt; concept to mean, then by all means leave the words as they are, but 
&gt; then good luck with writing your axioms.

I think we're going to have a tough time writing the axioms in any case, but
let's not get hung up on the epistemology/metaphysics bifurcation.
Philosophers don't even agree among themselves about how to divide
epistemology from metaphysics, since there are reams of debate about how the
inner and outer worlds interface.  For extreme relativists, it's all
epistemology; for behaviorists it's all metaphysics, on some construal of
metaphysics.  Once again, I think the goal here should be to devise a set of
concepts and axioms that allows us to say anything we would ever want to say
in a formal context, whether these concepts and axioms are cultural
constructs or reflective of the underlying fabric of the universe.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation HomogeneousObject "A ContinuousObject in

&gt; &gt; &gt; beaker of pure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;distilled water in a controlled environment.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This depends crucially on what you consider to be a 'relevant'
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspect. See later comments on variableObject.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Right.  Why don't we replace "relevant respect" with 
&gt; "physical property"?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, but isnt being further north than something else a physical 
&gt; relation? It is notoriously hard to classify 'kinds' of property in 
&gt; this way except on very broad lines.

Well, we could use "intrinsic property" if that makes things clearer.  Or we
could just give a nice list of examples and assume that our readers will be
able to extract the common property.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; stable identity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;during any interval of time. Formally, Occurrent satisfies
&gt; &gt; &gt; the following
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;conditions:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * The temporal parts of an occurrent exist at different times.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * The spatial parts of an occurrent may exist at the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; time, but an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occurrent may have 	different spatial parts at 
&gt; different times
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   * There are no identity conditions that can be used to
&gt; &gt; &gt; identify two
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occurrents that are 	observed in nonoverlapping 
&gt; space-time regions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different
&gt; &gt; &gt; stages of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;life cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant,
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;person's fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable
&gt; &gt; &gt; identity conditions
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;at each stage. Even then, the identification depends on an
&gt; &gt; &gt; inference that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The above is highly incoherent. I will just make a few
&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious comments.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. the temporal parts of ANYTHING exist at different times, by
&gt; &gt; &gt; definition of 'temporal part'. (What you ought to have 
&gt; said is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurrents HAVE temporal parts, in contrast to continuants.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A continuant can also have different spatial parts at different
&gt; &gt; &gt; times: your body, for example, renews itself almost 
&gt; completely during
&gt; &gt; &gt; an average year.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. There ARE identity conditions which can be used to identify
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping spacetime 
&gt; regions. For
&gt; &gt; &gt; example, one can identify the two halves of a soccer match.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Or, to take the other example, one CAN recognize two different
&gt; &gt; &gt; stages in someone's life. And, contrary to Aristotle and his
&gt; &gt; &gt; followers, this does NOT always require that a continuant be
&gt; &gt; &gt; identified 'at each stage'. That might indeed be a sound basis for
&gt; &gt; &gt; legal rules of evidence, but it is not a philosophical 
&gt; requirement.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The basic identity condition for being two stages of one life are
&gt; &gt; &gt; that there is a life of which the stages are stages, and 
&gt; that is all.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether this 'life' is a continuant or an occurrent is 
&gt; irrelevant to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the basic rule of identity.  Now, how one *recognizes* 
&gt; this identity
&gt; &gt; &gt; is another matter, and a potentially very complicated 
&gt; one, requiring
&gt; &gt; &gt; a detailed analysis of what it takes to perform an act of 
&gt; recognition
&gt; &gt; &gt; and many other arcane and complex issues in psychology: 
&gt; but this is
&gt; &gt; &gt; all COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to ontological classification.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, how about we revise the docu-string for 'Occurrent' as follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Occurrent "An entity that has temporal parts 
&gt; and, thus, does
&gt; &gt;not have a stable identity
&gt; &gt;during any interval of time.")
&gt; 
&gt; No, it can have a stable identity during an interval. A relay race is 
&gt; an occurrent, and it has a stable identity while it is being run. In 
&gt; fact, the only useful part of the 'occurrent' idea, I think, is that 
&gt; it is something which is temporally extended and which is thought of 
&gt; as having parts which are separated perpendicularly to the time-axis. 
&gt; In other words, the parts of an occurrent cannot be present at the 
&gt; same time, but while they last, they occupy the entirety of the 
&gt; occurrent. They are 'stages' rather than 'physical parts'. (Contrast 
&gt; the definition of continuant.)

OK, how about the following instead?

(documentation Occurrent "An entity that has temporal parts and, thus, is
not wholly present whenever one of its parts is present.")

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Physical "An entity that has a location in
&gt; &gt; &gt; space-time.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A technical question: do spaces and times themselves have 
&gt; a location
&gt; &gt; &gt; in spacetime? (My own preference is to say not, but Cyc takes a
&gt; &gt; &gt; different view. But either way, we need a clear answer to avoid
&gt; &gt; &gt; rapidly descending into muddled axioms.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, let's just pick one option or the other and go with it.  
&gt; I don't think
&gt; &gt;any engineering applications will be hampered by our 
&gt; decision to assign or
&gt; &gt;not assign spaces and times themselves a location in spacetime.
&gt; 
&gt; Since both Cyc and Matthew West seem to think spaces and times have 
&gt; spatiotemporal locations, lets go that route. The idea here then is 
&gt; that a time is something like the 3-d world at that time, and there 
&gt; need be no sharp conceptual distinction between a physical object at 
&gt; a place, and the place it is at. One can use spatial and temporal 
&gt; language directly on physical things without needing to interpose 
&gt; 'place-of' or 'time-of' functions, which is often handy and keeps the 
&gt; axioms shorter.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent
&gt; &gt; &gt; specification of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;actions and events: including: computer programs,
&gt; &gt; &gt; finite-state machines,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Petri nets, robot commands, cooking recipes, musical scores,
&gt; &gt; &gt; conference
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;schedules, driving directions, and the scripts of actions
&gt; &gt; &gt; and dialog in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent
&gt; &gt; &gt; a dynamic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;process, it may have static parts.  In a movie film, for 
&gt; example, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sequence of images is a script that determines the motion,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but each frame is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a schema of a static image.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; See comments below on 'schema' and 'script'. Also this 
&gt; list is very
&gt; &gt; &gt; confusing, since some of the things in it are linguistic in nature
&gt; &gt; &gt; (computer programs), others are mathematical abstractions (Petri
&gt; &gt; &gt; nets) and others are physical (musical scores and movie film). In
&gt; &gt; &gt; what sense is a movie film a 'specification' ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, how about we revise the docu-string as follows?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Procedure "A sequence-dependent specification 
&gt; of actions and
&gt; &gt;events.  Some examples are computer programs, finite-state 
&gt; machines, cooking
&gt; &gt;recipes, musical scores, conference schedules, driving 
&gt; directions, and the
&gt; &gt;scripts of actions and dialog in plays and movies.")
&gt; 
&gt; But there is still something very odd about this concept (never mind 
&gt; the docu-string). What is the point of distinguishing a class of 
&gt; descriptions on the basis of what kind of thing they describe, at 
&gt; this level of generality?

I can't answer this question.  I'll defer to John Sowa.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Process "A Physical Occurrent during the 
&gt; interval of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same actual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic
&gt; &gt; &gt; process. Even an entity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;as stable as a diamond could be considered a process when
&gt; &gt; &gt; viewed over a long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Quite. So there is no useful categorical distinction to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; made, as I suggest.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (BTW, what is the 'interval of interest', exactly?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think this problem is resolved by making 'Process' an instance of
&gt; &gt;'OccurrentType'.  In that case, something can be seen as 
&gt; either an object or
&gt; &gt;a process, but the kind 'Process' is an 'OccurrentType', 
&gt; while 'Object'
&gt; &gt;would be a 'ContinuantType'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In
&gt; &gt; &gt; logic, the assertion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds
&gt; &gt; &gt; to some aspect
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an
&gt; &gt; &gt; example, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat
&gt; &gt; &gt; characterizes the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;entity named Yojo.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This doesnt seem to distinguish the sentence from the proposition
&gt; &gt; &gt; expressed by that sentence. Exactly what a proposition is, is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; matter of controversy, but in at least one view, it isnt 
&gt; anything at
&gt; &gt; &gt; all like a sentence. BTW, what exactly is the word "Cat" 
&gt; supposed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; indicate in that last sentence?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, we could replace the concept of Proposition (which 
&gt; probably is of much
&gt; &gt;more interest to philosophers than engineers) with that of Sentence.
&gt; 
&gt; Sentence of logic or of English?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;We
&gt; &gt;could then make the latter an immediate subclass of 
&gt; 'ContentBearingObject'.
&gt; &gt;Or perhaps we could make 'Sign' an immediate subclass of
&gt; &gt;'ContentBearingObject' and 'Sentence' an immediate subclass 
&gt; of 'Sign' and
&gt; &gt;'Arrangement'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some
&gt; &gt; &gt; other entity.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ? The relation is an entity in a relationship to some 
&gt; other entity?
&gt; &gt; &gt; So if (R a b), R is not the relation, but a and b are? 
&gt; This is just
&gt; &gt; &gt; nonsense.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, how about the following instead?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Relation "A set of ordered n-tuples.")
&gt; 
&gt; No, that would give engineers colic and my intensional colleagues 
&gt; would be after my blood. Let me ask a question: why do we even need 
&gt; this as a category in the ontological heirarchy? The very logical 
&gt; language will distinguish relations from other things in its syntax. 
&gt; So we could just say: Relation: anything denoted by a relation 
&gt; symbol. (I know its circular. What did you want, a *definition* ? )

But aren't we already assuming an extensional interpretation for SUO-KIF?
In any case, I don't think that the fact that a category is syntactically
marked absolves us of the need to ontologize the category.  In fact, I think
the opposite is true.  Something that is featured in the structure of the
language deserves a prominent spot in the ontology, I would argue.  And,
yes, I did want a *definition* (I assume you mean here the philosophers'
notion of definition).  These docu-strings are supposed to make the meaning
of the concepts clear to people who weren't involved in constructing the
ontology.   

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Schema "An Abstract form that has the 
&gt; structure of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Continuant and, thus, does not specify time or timelike
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Examples include geometric forms, the syntactic structures
&gt; &gt; &gt; of sentences in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;some language, or the encodings of pictures in a 
&gt; multimedia system.")
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Script "An Abstract form that has the 
&gt; structure of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Occurrent and, thus, represents time sequences.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Both of these (and 'kineticForm') are muddled ideas. They 
&gt; confuse the
&gt; &gt; &gt; structure of the form with the structure of what the form 
&gt; describes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, I agree with you here.  What if we use the following docu-strings
&gt; &gt;instead?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation SchemaObject "An object that embodies 
&gt; information that has
&gt; &gt;the structure of a Continuant and, thus, does not specify

&gt; geometric form
&gt; &gt;of a cube.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Script "An object that embodies information 
&gt; that has the
&gt; &gt;structure of an Occurrent and, thus, represents time sequences.")
&gt; 
&gt; Im still confused. The *information* has a spatiotemporal structure? 
&gt; What does THAT mean? (What is a temporal part of an information? )
&gt; 
&gt; Look, Im not quibbling about the wording of the docu-strings: I don't 
&gt; think these *ideas* are not really coherent.

I agree that this notion is not sufficiently clear.  I'll think more about
it, and perhaps John Sowa can chime in.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Sign "A Sign is considered as representing
&gt; &gt; &gt; something to some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agent.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a quibble, but I think that it might be more use to 
&gt; characterise
&gt; &gt; &gt; a sign as something intended by one agent to represent 
&gt; something for
&gt; &gt; &gt; another agent (or agents). People often find meaning in 
&gt; things that
&gt; &gt; &gt; arent usually categorised as signs (except in a 
&gt; metaphorical sense),
&gt; &gt; &gt; cf. many folk sayings about smoke and fire.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;OK, this sounds like a good refinement.  Why don't we rephrase the
&gt; &gt;docu-string as follows?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Sign "A Sign is something that is intended by 
&gt; one agent to
&gt; &gt;represent something to another agent or agents.  Note that 
&gt; this definition
&gt; &gt;excludes natural phenomena and their interpretation, e.g. a 
&gt; cloud formation
&gt; &gt;that resembles a physical object.")
&gt; 
&gt; You had better run this past Sowa and maybe some other Peircians: 
&gt; maybe they wanted it to include clouds and smoke, I'm not sure.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject that
&gt; &gt; &gt; nonetheless varies
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; An example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Consider a homogenous object which has the same chemical 
&gt; consituency,
&gt; &gt; &gt; temperature, etc., throughout; like a cube of pure gold. It is as
&gt; &gt; &gt; unVariable as one could possibly achieve, let us suppose.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, it does vary in some ways. Parts of it, for example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; are further north than other parts, and again, some parts 
&gt; of it are
&gt; &gt; &gt; higher in the gravity field than other parts. So its parts can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; distinguished from each other. Now, is it therefore a 
&gt; VariableObject?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect you will want to say not, but on what basis? You cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt; claim that *every* property of all its parts are shared by all its
&gt; &gt; &gt; other parts. What I suspect you want to say is that all its parts
&gt; &gt; &gt; have the same *intrinsic* properties, maybe, or maybe the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; *physical* properties. Or maybe you could say that the 
&gt; object is made
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the same *stuff* throughout. But in any case, you do 
&gt; need to say
&gt; &gt; &gt; what it is you actually do mean.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree.  Why don't we rephrase the docu-string as follows?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject whose 
&gt; physical properties
&gt; &gt;may nonetheless vary.  That is, the temperature, chemical 
&gt; constitution,
&gt; &gt;density, etc. may change from one part to another.  An example of a
&gt; &gt;VariableObject would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")
&gt; 
&gt; Well, OK. But my point was really that unless you restrict the *kind* 
&gt; of physical property somehow,  this category is useless since all 
&gt; continuous objects are variable object.

Right, so there wouldn't be any point to the distinction as long as we
assume an extensional interpretation of the language.  OK, I'll give this
one some more thought as well.
