While reviewing a few of the SUO discussions
in which I participated during the last year,
I noticed a topic that strikes me as salient
with respect to questions about the relation
of pragmatic thinking to natural science, to
be specific, in regard to their perspectives
on the nature of laws and the uses of models.

For the sake of recovering the context of my own share in this discussion,
I am appending an extended list of links as they fell out along this line,
teasing out also the more timely of these threads and reweaving them here.

Subj:  Triadically Irreducible Relations &amp; Teridentity
Date:  Thu, 05 Oct 2000 11:11:49 -0400
From:  Jon Awbrey &lt;jawbrey@oakland.edu&gt;
  To:  [Peirce Subgroup]

Abstractions are just partial descriptions,
descriptions that leave out a lot of detail.

It is our bound fate as human narrators that
all of our descriptions will be abstractions,
as long as we talk about anything significant,
extractions from the wealth of possible detail
that are likely to be partial in both of these
senses, incomplete and biased, and hence they
will be samples, selections, simplifications,
specimens, symptoms, ..., and thus to make
a long story short, signs, just signs.

So the question is not really whether there is something more
to the subject after we have finished with our partial account --
if the subject was interesting, there will always be more to say.
The question is just whether certain sorts of partial description
can be useful in understanding a vastly more complex reality.
And classifying the patterns in &quot;how we think&quot; according to
your favorite system of logical forms can indeed be useful,
depending on your favorite system, of course.

| Digression
|
| This makes it sound like logic is a descriptive science,
| just another branch of psychology, and, of course, we all
| know that this particular idea is just not sound.  Perhaps
| it always begins as a descriptive description of language,
| like noticing the tautology in &quot;descriptive description&quot;,
| but then it becomes a prescriptive doctrine that says,
| in the same instance, &quot;Quit saying stuff like that!&quot;,
| or a normative science that says, more contingently,
| &quot;If you are interested in achieving a certain economy,
| effectiveness, and efficiency in your communication,
| then you will want to avoid the use of such redundant,
| repetitive, and needless to say 'pleonastic' phrasing&quot;.
| And you probably have heard about how Peirce championed
| what he called a &quot;non-psychological&quot; account of logic,
| with respect to which I have explained the funny way
| that mathematically trained people then and now still
| use the prefix &quot;non&quot; in such cases, almost an acronym
| for &quot;not of necessity&quot;, to widen a subject beyond its
| initial domain by dropping one or more of the initial
| axioms.  What this means is that we can still regard
| the descriptive study of &quot;how we think&quot; as providing
| data, and some of the most fascinating data, indeed,
| considering who we are and all, but still just grist
| for the mill of a normative study.  But I digress ...

That seems simple enough, but you know there is more to be said.
There are in the idioms of ordinary discussion about these matters
just one or two or three things that are likely to cause confusion.

I called your attention to this overcharged property of -ionized words,
like &quot;abstraction&quot;, that they equivocally denote both process and result,
both conduct and product, if you will.  So we have a picture like this:

|                   Abstraction
|    Abstractee    (the process)    Abstraction
|   (the object) o-------&gt;-------o (description)

But as you well know, or have come to accept, it gets worse.
Having invested so much in their partial descriptions, people
will tend to become, well, 'partial' to them.  And, human nature
being what it is, it seems to be something of a sore annoyance to
keep thinking about something that you love so much as imperfect,
so people will come to imagine that there really is some object
that is perfectly described by their favorite description.
Comes the dawn of the hypostasis, the imaginary substance
that we shove under our abstraction to shore it up.

|                   Abstraction
|    Abstractee    (the process)    Abstraction
|   (the object) o-------&gt;-------o (description)
|                 \             ^
|                  \           /
|                   \         /
|                    \       /
|                     \     /
|                      \   /
|                       v /
|                        o
|                   Abstraction
|                  (hypo-stasis)

And with this form of triple equivocality in the word &quot;abstraction&quot;
I think that the mathematician in all of us thinks to have achieved
a &quot;form of perfection&quot; (FOP).

And with that, I think that perhaps I should quit
while I still have my head, and take up the rest
of your note at a later time.

I leave you to contemplate the charge of our champion.

Date:  Thu, 05 Oct 2000 14:14:05 -0400
From:  Jon Awbrey &lt;jawbrey@oakland.edu&gt;

John,

No sweat about exiling all the poets from this
or any other Re:Public -- I gather that they
have become quite accustomed to it by now,
and I tend to suspect that they would not
have it any other way.  It gives them all
a well-deserved holiday from the likes
of us straight-latticed types.

I have changed the title of this discussion as a way
of attempting to bring out the more positive aspects
of what I see as a complex of many underlying topics.

The notion of &quot;abstraction&quot;, of course, becomes associated
with this list of concepts for a significantly distinctive
reason than the notions that fall into the other slots, and
so I will take it up first, though by no means finish with it.

By way of establishing immediate relevance to ontologies,
I will just remind people of the important distinction
that you make between 'axiomatic' and 'prototypic'
ontologies:

<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/</A>
<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/gloss.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/gloss.htm</A>

I have recently been instructed, by folks who ought to know,
that a presentation of any research topic ought to begin with
a historical introduction and a review of the literature, so,
in a token gesture to that type of advice, I was planning to
go back to Aristotle and tell you how he would tell us that
this all got started, but, on second thought, I think that
I will begin with something out of a more recent exchange
that I had with one of the habitués of the Peirce Forum,
on this very topic of &quot;abstraction&quot;.

My reasons for interjecting this particular exchange
into the present context are twofold:

1.  I think that our ambivalent, nay, &quot;amtrivalent&quot; usage
    of the term &quot;abstraction&quot; amply illustrates one of the
    significant types of ambiguity that still prevails in
    both our casual and our formal idioms, and that will
    prove recalcitrant to being &quot;managed&quot; without losing
    touch with the way that the rest of the world speaks --
    perhaps not entirely a bad thing, still, it's not so
    easy being an exile if you have not got used to it,
    yet.

2.  I think that everyone will immediately recognize the
    abstract similarity that exists between the diagram
    that I draw below and the one that I drew a couple
    of days ago in my conversation with Chris Menzel
    about assertions and propositions in sentential
    calculus or &quot;zeroth order logic&quot; (ZOL), to wit:

                        f
                  X o------&gt;o B
                     \     ^
     &lt;x_1, ..., x_n&gt;  \   /  f'
                       v /
                        o
                       B^n

    You may remember that this was supposed to illustrate
    the &quot;factoring&quot; of a proposition f : X -&gt; B = {0, 1}
    into the composition f'(c(x)), where c : X -&gt; B^n is
    the &quot;coding&quot; of each x in X as an n-bit string in B^n,
    and where f' is the mapping of codes into a co-domain
    that we interpret as t-f-values, B = {0, 1} = {F, T}.

SUO Group:

Here is the historical introduction that I promised you last time.

I start as near to the beginning as I can get and present Aristotle's
original account of the form of reasoning that he called &quot;paradeigma&quot;.
The name suggests a &quot;side-show&quot;, or a parallel comparison of cases, and
it is usually translated as reasoning by analogy, example, or paradigm.

In this context, it is useful to revisit once again the story
of a simple instance of inquiry that I presented a while back:

<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg00676.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg00676.html</A>

It is interesting to note that this story is really a narrative cycle
in miniature, with the cycle of inquiry proceeding through all of its
typical phases in the typical order:  Abduction, Deduction, Induction.

Regarding the two examples together in this way, one can make make the
curious observation that the first two steps of inquiry, taken in tandem,
present a type of lattice-theoretic dual to the two steps that are spanned
in reasoning by analogy.  I don't really know what to make of this yet --
I just think that it's curious.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Complex and Mixed Forms of Reasoning (CAMFOR's)

In discussing complex and mixed forms of reasoning,
like those that are typically involved in forming
analogies and conducting inquiries, it helps to
begin with some maximally simple examples, and
this will lead us to look under the lamp-post
of &quot;apophantic&quot; reasoning, that is, among
propositional, sentential, or syllogistic
styles of reasoning.  This is alright,
so long as we do not imagine that we
can remain in this charmed circle
forever.

Examples of Cyclic, Parallel, &amp; Serial Syllogisms

The discussion of analogy and inquiry cries out for a couple
of good examples -- models of inference that will be concrete,
intuitive, simple enough to cut our teeth on at the early phases
of our reflective meta-morphosis, but solid enough to also serve
in sharpening the tools of our meta-logical reasoning capacities.

Along these lines, the best points of departure that I have yet
encountered are:

1.  For analogy, Aristotle's incipient but incisive account
    of its anatomy and function, treating it as a species
    of hybrid inference.

2.  For inquiry, John Dewey's deceptively simple but
    richly suggestive story of inquiry activities in
    everyday life.

In order to allow readers an opportunity to contemplate these
examples on their own, before I truck up the grounds with my
own way of laying out their constructions, I will cite them
here first, then set out a traditional array of terminology
that I will need, and then proceed to the dissecting room.

Aristotle's &quot;War Against Neighbors&quot; Example

| Let A be &quot;bad&quot;, B &quot;to make war on neighbors&quot;,
| C &quot;Athens against Thebes&quot;, and D &quot;Thebes against Phocis&quot;.
| Then if we require to prove that war against Thebes is bad,
| we must be satisfied that war against neighbors is bad.
| Evidence of this can be drawn from similar examples,
| e.g., that war by Thebes against Phocis is bad. 
| Then since war against neighbors is bad, and
| war against Thebes is against neighbors,
| it is evident that war against Thebes is bad.
|
| Aristotle, 'Prior Analytics', 2.24

John Dewey's &quot;Sign of Rain&quot; Example

| A man is walking on a warm day.  The sky was clear the
| last time he observed it;  but presently he notes, while
| occupied primarily with other things, that the air is cooler.
| It occurs to him that it is probably going to rain;  looking up,
| he sees a dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then quickens
| his steps.  What, if anything, in such a situation can be called
| thought?  Neither the act of walking nor the noting of the cold
| is a thought.  Walking is one direction of activity;  looking and
| noting are other modes of activity.  The likelihood that it will
| rain is, however, something 'suggested'.  The pedestrian 'feels'
| the cold;  he 'thinks of' clouds and a coming shower.
|
| John Dewey, 'How We Think', 1910, pages 6-7

A good start at analyzing these examples, surprisingly enough,
can be made within a primitive propositional and syllogistic
framework.  In order to carry this out, I will first outline
a few terms of art from classical logic that can be used to
articulate the procedural stages of a generic inquiry process,
and then I will present my analysis of what is taking place,
logically speaking, to move this particular inquiry forward.

Basic Terminology

In the case of propositional logic, deduction comes down to an
application of the transitive law for conditional implications.
Contemplated on the scheme of Figure 1, deduction takes
a Case, the minor premiss X =&gt; Y, and puts it with
a Rule, the major premiss Y =&gt; Z, to arrive at
a Fact, the demonstrative conclusion X =&gt; Z.

Contrasted with this pattern, induction takes
a Fact of the form X =&gt; Z and matches it with
a Case of the form X =&gt; Y to guess that
a Rule of the form Y =&gt; Z is possibly in play.

Cast on this same template, abduction takes
a Fact of the form X =&gt; Z and matches it with
a Rule of the form Y =&gt; Z to guess that
a Case of the form X =&gt; Y is presently in view.

In its original usage a statement of Fact has to do with
a deed done or a record made, that is, a type of event that
is openly observable and not riddled with speculation as to
its very occurrence.  In contrast, a statement of Case may
refer to a hidden or a hypothetical cause, that is, a type
of event that is not immediately observable to all concerned.
Obviously, the distinction is a rough one and the question
of which mode applies can depend on the points of view that
different observers adopt over time.  Finally, a statement
of a Rule is called that because it states a regularity or
a regulation that governs a whole class of situations, and
not because of its syntactic form.  So far in this discussion,
all three types of constraint are expressed in the form of
conditional propositions, but this is not a fixed requirement.
In practice, these modes of statement are distinguished by
the roles that they play within an argument, not by their
style of expression.  When the time comes to branch out from
the syllogistic framework, we will find that propositional
constraints can be discovered and represented in arbitrary
syntactic forms.

In the normal course of a typical inquiry, the three basic types of
inference proceed in the order:  Abduction, Deduction, Induction.
However, the same building blocks can be assembled in other ways
to yield different kinds of complex inferences.  Of particular
importance for our purposes, reasoning by analogy is analyzed
as a combination of induction and deduction, in other words,
as the abstraction and application of a Rule.

For ease of reference, Figure 1 and
the Legend beneath it summarize the
classical terminology for the three
types of inference and the relations
that can be observed among them.

| Figure 1.  Basic Structure &amp; Terminology
|
| Deduction takes a Case, the minor premiss of the form X =&gt; Y,
| matches it with a Rule, the major premiss of the form Y =&gt; Z,
| then adverts to a Fact, the bound outcome of the form X =&gt; Z.
|
| Induction takes a Case of the form X =&gt; Y,
| matches it with a Fact of the form X =&gt; Z,
| then adverts to a Rule of the form Y =&gt; Z.
|
| Abduction takes a Fact of the form X =&gt; Z,
| matches it with a Rule of the form Y =&gt; Z,
| then adverts to a Case of the form X =&gt; Y.
|
| Even more succinctly:
|
|           Abduction  Deduction  Induction
|
| Premiss:     Fact       Rule       Case
| Premiss:     Rule       Case       Fact
| Outcome:     Case       Fact       Rule

Aristotle's Illustration of Reasoning by Analogy, Example, Paradigm

Here is the original statement again:

| Let A be &quot;bad&quot;, B &quot;to make war on neighbors&quot;,
| C &quot;Athens against Thebes&quot;, and D &quot;Thebes against Phocis&quot;.
| Then if we require to prove that war against Thebes is bad,
| we must be satisfied that war against neighbors is bad.
| Evidence of this can be drawn from similar examples,
| e.g., that war by Thebes against Phocis is bad. 
| Then since war against neighbors is bad, and
| war against Thebes is against neighbors,
| it is evident that war against Thebes is bad.
|
| Aristotle, 'Prior Analytics', 2.24

Figure 2 gives a graphical illustration of Aristotle's
example of &quot;Example&quot;, that is, the form of reasoning
that proceeds by Analogy or according to a Paradigm.

In this analysis of reasoning by Analogy,
it is a complex or a mixed form of inference
that can be seen as taking place in two steps:

1.  The first step is an Induction that abstracts a Rule
    from a Case and a Fact.

(Case)   D =&gt; B,   Thebes vs Phocis is a battle between neighbors.
(Fact)   D =&gt; A,   Thebes vs Phocis is adverse to all.
(Rule)   B =&gt; A,   A battle between neighbors is adverse to all.

2.  The final step is a Deduction that applies this Rule
    to a Case to arrive at a Fact.

(Case)   C =&gt; B,   Athens vs Thebes is a battle between neighbors.
(Rule)   B =&gt; A,   A battle between neighbors is adverse to all.
(Fact)   C =&gt; A,   Athens vs Thebes is adverse to all.

Analysis of Dewey's Example of Inquiry

Returning to the &quot;Rainy Day&quot; story, we find our peripatetic
hero presented with a surprising Fact:

(Fact)   C =&gt; A,   &quot;in the Current situation the Air is cool&quot;.

Responding to an intellectual reflex of puzzlement about the
situation, his resource of common knowledge about the world
is impelled to seize on an approximate Rule:

(Rule)   B =&gt; A,   &quot;just Before it rains, the Air is cool&quot;.     

This Rule can be recognized as having a potential relevance to
the situation because it matches the surprising Fact, C =&gt; A,
in its consequential feature A.  All of this suggests that the
present Case may be one in which it is just about to rain:

(Case)   C =&gt; B,   &quot;the Current situation is just Before it rains&quot;.

The whole mental performance, however automatic and semi-conscious
it may be, that leads from a problematic Fact and a knowledge base
of Rules to the plausible suggestion of a Case description, is what
is usually called an abductive inference.

The next phase of inquiry uses deductive inference to expand
the implied consequences of the abductive hypothesis, with the
aim of testing its truth.  For this purpose, the inquirer needs
to think of other things that would follow from the consequence
of his precipitate explanation.  Thus, he now reflects on the
Case just assumed:

(Case)   C =&gt; B,   &quot;the Current situation is just Before it rains&quot;.

He looks up to scan the sky, perhaps in a random search for
further information, but since the sky is a logical place to
look for details of an imminent rainstorm, symbolized in our
story by the letter B, we may safely suppose that our reasoner
has already detached the consequence of the abduced Case, C =&gt; B,
and has begun to expand on its further implications.  So let us
imagine that our up-looker has a more deliberate purpose in mind,
and that his search for additional data is driven by the new-found,
determinate Rule:

(Rule)   B =&gt; D,   &quot;just Before it rains, Dark clouds appear&quot;.

Contemplating the assumed Case in combination with this new Rule
leads him by an immediate deduction to predict an additional Fact:

(Fact)   C =&gt; D,   &quot;in the Current situation Dark clouds appear&quot;.

The reconstructed picture of reasoning assembled in this second phase
of inquiry is true to the pattern of deductive inference.

Whatever the case, our subject observes a Dark cloud, just as he would
expect on the basis of the new hypothesis.  The explanation of imminent
rain removes the discrepancy between observations and expectations and
thereby reduces the shock of surprise that made this inquiry necessary.

Figure 3 gives a graphical illustration of Dewey's example of inquiry,
isolating for the purposes of the present analysis the first two steps
in the more extended proceedings that go to make up the whole inquiry.

In this analysis of the first steps of Inquiry,
we have a complex or a mixed form of inference
that can be noted as taking place in two steps:

1.  The first step is an Abduction that abstracts a Case
    from the consideration of a Fact and a Rule.

(Fact)   C =&gt; A,   In the Current situation the Air is cool.
(Rule)   B =&gt; A,   Just Before it rains, the Air is cool.
(Case)   C =&gt; B,   The Current situation is just Before it rains.

2.  The next step is a Deduction that admits this Case
    to another Rule and so arrives at a novel Fact.

(Case)   C =&gt; B,   The Current situation is just Before it rains.
(Rule)   B =&gt; D,   Just Before it rains, a Dark cloud will appear.
(Fact)   C =&gt; D,   In the Current situation, a Dark cloud will appear.

This is nowhere near a complete analysis of the Rainy Day inquiry,
even insofar as it might be carried out within the constraints of
the syllogistic framework, and it covers only the first two steps
of the relevant inquiry process, but maybe it will do for a start.
