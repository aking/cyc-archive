&gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; 
&gt; There seems to be a question of what "reduction of a triadic relation
&gt; to dyadic relations" means to different people.  So using Jon's example
&gt; of an AND truth table, here is what I mean.  I mean that for any n-ary
&gt; relation I can create a set of at most n binary relations from which
&gt; the original n-ary relation can be created as a view.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have skills in SQL but using Microsoft Access I was able
&gt; to construct the following tables and a view definition based on
&gt; them using the graphical tools of Access. The SQL presented below
&gt; is an output from this.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are the results:
&gt; 
&gt; Truth_Value_Table
&gt; o------------o
&gt; |Truth_Value |
&gt; o------------o
&gt; |False       |
&gt; |True        |
&gt; o------------o
&gt; 
&gt; AND_Truth_Table
&gt; o---------o
&gt; |Row      |
&gt; o---------o
&gt; |AND-Row-1|
&gt; |AND-Row-2|
&gt; |AND-Row-3|
&gt; |AND-Row-4|
&gt; o---------o
&gt; 
&gt; AND_Argument1
&gt; o-----------o----------------o
&gt; |Row        |    Arg1-Value  |
&gt; |AND-Row-1  |    True        |
&gt; |AND-Row-2  |    True        |
&gt; |AND-Row-3  |    False       |
&gt; |AND-Row-4  |    False       |
&gt; o-----------o----------------o
&gt; 
&gt; AND_Argument2
&gt; o-----------o----------------o
&gt; |Row        |    Arg2-Value  |
&gt; |AND-Row-1  |    True        |
&gt; |AND-Row-2  |    False       |
&gt; |AND-Row-3  |    True        |
&gt; |AND-Row-4  |    False       |
&gt; o-----------o----------------o
&gt; 
&gt; AND_Result
&gt; o-----------o----------------o
&gt; |Row        |    Result-Value|
&gt; |AND-Row-1  |    True        |
&gt; |AND-Row-2  |    False       |
&gt; |AND-Row-3  |    False       |
&gt; |AND-Row-4  |    False       |
&gt; o-----------o----------------o
&gt; 
&gt; AND_Truth_Table_Query (Query Definition)
&gt; 
&gt; SELECT AND_Argument1.[Arg1-Value],
&gt;        AND_Argument2.[Arg2-Value],
&gt;        AND_Result.[Result-Value]
&gt; FROM
&gt;   (AND_Argument1
&gt;      INNER JOIN AND_Argument2
&gt;        ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Argument2.Row)
&gt;      INNER JOIN AND_Result
&gt;        ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Result.Row;
&gt; 
&gt; (Result of executing the query)
&gt; o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt; |Arg1-Value | Arg2-Value | Result-Value|
&gt; o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt; |True       | True       | True        |
&gt; |True       | False      | False       |
&gt; |False      | True       | False       |
&gt; |False      | False      | False       |

&gt; From where I sit doing this is trivial technically.
&gt; And when I say that a triadic relation can be "reduced" to
&gt; a dyadic form, this (and not something else) is what I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is, why and when might this be useful?
&gt; The answer is that many n-ary relations are overconstrained.
&gt; I.e. they are not a good model because there are many cases
&gt; they do not support.
&gt; 
&gt; This is particularly so when activities are represented by relations.
&gt; Take giving as an example.  Using a relation to represent this does
&gt; not only require that there is a giver, a receiver, and a gift, but
&gt; it requires that there is not more than one giver, receiver, and gift.
&gt; Whilst it is true that there are some giving acts for which this
&gt; constraint holds, it is not true for all giving activities.
&gt; And whilst you could define relations for all the possible
&gt; combinations of different numbers of givers, receivers,
&gt; and gifts, this is not particularly practical.
&gt; 
&gt; So how does changing the representation of an activity from
&gt; a relation to a set and some binary relations help?
&gt; 
&gt; The answer is that it removes the constraints.
&gt; Actually it removes both the minimum constraints
&gt; and the maximum constraints.
&gt; 
&gt; Even removing the minimum constraint can be useful
&gt; from an epistemological viewpoint.  So whilst in
&gt; an act of giving ontologically we know that there
&gt; must be at least one giver, one given and one gift,
&gt; do we necessarily have knowledge of each of these
&gt; for any giving activity?  More particularly do we
&gt; always have to care?
&gt; 
&gt; Example:  Steve Redgrave was given his 5th gold medal in
&gt; rowing at the Sydney Olympics.  Do we care who gave it to him?
&gt; Would we wish to be prevented from recording anything about this
&gt; giving act if we could not identify the person who gave it to him?
&gt; I think not.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course there are times when you do want to require some information.
&gt; Explicit axioms can be used to support this.  For example, if you do not
&gt; have a product ordered and a customer at least, then there is no purpose
&gt; to accepting only partial information as an order.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards

Matthew,

Virtual Reality (VR) is a lot of fun, can be very educational,
and is well-known to have a panoply of practical applications,
among which number a wealth of deadly serious industrial uses --
I have seen instructional software for the domain of physics
where one can play with frictionless pucks, bounce a six-ton
superball off an ideally inelastic concrete wall on a planet
with the gravity of Jupiter, all while keeping my own bipeds
solidly planted on "Terra Firma" (TF), where I can entertain
myself with life in a universe where entropy is conservative
and energy is liberal, been there, done that, and I can tell
you that it was a truly miraculous existence, a virtual trip,
if not quite literally a Veri-Table Experience -- but a line
divides a "Virtual Imaginary Experiential World" (VIEW) from
a "Virtually InExistent World" (VIEW), a line evidently cast
too finely in this thin air to be dreamt of in the images of
my acronymic philosophy.  But if the lesson that a person is
thereby instructed to draw from this bit of virtual exercise
is that the laws of physics and the laws of information are
somehow optional for the likes of me and thee, or that they
could indeed be disrespected by the very designatories who
designed these virtual environments, then that person has
another lesson coming.

But I am a sensible person, too -- no, really! -- at any rate,
when the currents of my rarefied air have a functional moment
of coordinate projection in exactly the right eigen-direction,
and so I must tell you that I smell something just a bit ripe,
indeed, more over-ripe, here, in this, your reputed reduction.

So I will ask you to climb down off your end-user's high-chair,
and to think for a while about what is really going on beneath
the glib and glossy surface of your Microsoft XS, and then, if
you honestly believe, and mean to claim, that no ANDimals were
used in the making of this filmy production, well, then we may
indeed be forced to proceed a bit further with the analysis of
your analysis, and all the categoriness of this meta-reduction.

Jon Awbrey
