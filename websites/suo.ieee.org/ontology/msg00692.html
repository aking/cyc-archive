&gt;Pat Hayes&gt;
&gt;There are relations which closely correspond to the existence of these
&gt;events, but one has to keep things straight to avoid confusion., For
&gt;example, in a billing, there is the relation (between two agents,
&gt;presumably, and a time) of a billing event having occurred (or, a bill
&gt;having been sent) between the agents at the time. But the event, and the
&gt;relation, are not the same kind of thing, and can't be identified with each
&gt;other.
&gt;
&gt;GH3&gt;	I'm trying to scope "relation". The event was a process which took a
&gt;finite period of time to occur. Is the relation the fact that this occurred
&gt;between the two parties?

No, a relation isnt a fact.  Facts just hold, but relations relate 
other things.

&gt;.....
&gt; &gt;GH2&gt;	I wonder whether we can get to a stage where we can appreciate each
&gt; &gt;other's concepts of relation.
&gt;
&gt;I'm using the word in the sense in which it used throughout logic (including
&gt;SUO-KIF) and mathematics.
&gt;
&gt;GH3&gt;	Obviously, I don't appreciate that sense of the word yet.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;In my case, the next thing I need to
&gt; &gt;understand is the meaning of "extension", as you used it above.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know what a set is? If so, the extension of a unary predicate is
&gt;simply the set of all the things that the predicate is true of. For binary
&gt;relations, it's the set of all pairs of things that the elation holds
&gt;between; for trinary relations, it's the set of all triples, etc. .A basic
&gt;assumption of logical languages is that relations with the same extension
&gt;are the same relation; or, in other words, the logic only really talks about
&gt;the extensions.
&gt;
.......
&gt;But, let's have a go. Does this mean, say,
&gt;that the relation of "billing by post" is a triple, say: (vendor, bill,
&gt;client), that applies to every instance where a vendor has posted a bill to
&gt;a client and the client received the bill?

Close. The relation is a *set* of triples: all the triples that the 
relation holds true of. So for example if A sent Bill to B , then the 
triple &lt;A, Bill,B&gt; is one of the triples in the "billing by post" 
relation-set. Of course there are probably others in the same set. 
Every time someone gets billed, that defines another triple in the 
relation-set. Think of this set of triples as God's database of all 
the billings that ever happened or ever will happen. (It has to be 
God's since it might well be infinite.) As far as logic is concerned, 
this (potentially infinite) set of triples *is* the relation in 
question.

&gt; &gt;GH2&gt;	I feel there is an important aspect to this. That is that the SUO
&gt; &gt;should be able to be comprehended by its users. Only that way, will they be
&gt; &gt;able to use it with confidence of being accurate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;GH2&gt;	Therefore, I suggest we are going to have to find means of
&gt; &gt;describing the underlying principles in ordinary, everyday language that
&gt;the
&gt; &gt;non-cognoscenti are, at least in principle, able to understand. I believe
&gt; &gt;our target user population should not need to be graduates of high-flown
&gt; &gt;philosophy or logic courses to be able to understand the SUO.
&gt;
&gt;Well, this raises an interesting issue of methodology. Making an ontology
&gt;isn't just writing down what you know in some semiformalized English which
&gt;any bloke can understand just by reading it.  It does involve at least some
&gt;technical competence and facility with the conventions of logic.  Not a
&gt;high-flown competence: just an intro. course would probably do the trick.
&gt;(Ive never taken a logic course in my life, for example.) The fact is that
&gt;any logical-based ontology will use logic, and if someone doesnt have even a
&gt;basic understanding of the principles of logic then they are likely to make
&gt;mistakes when using it. I don't see any way around this. If you want to lay
&gt;bricks, you have to know at least the basics of bricklaying, or your walls
&gt;will likely fall down.
&gt;
&gt;GH3&gt;	Well, what I would posit is that the relevant rules need to be
&gt;succinctly set out, possibly aided by examples, so that the uninitiated can
&gt;start at the beginning of the document and follow the logic through to the
&gt;end. It is acceptable for the introductory material to be set out in an
&gt;annex, or some other standard, but I would suggest it must be readily
&gt;available in a readily accessible form.

Its not quite that simple, unless the introductory material is going 
to amount to something like Symbolic Logic 101.  If someone doesnt 
have a basic grasp of what logics mean (and more especially what they 
DONT mean) , it isn't going to be possible to convey the gist of it 
in 'ordinary English' without being seriously misleading.

&gt;GH3&gt;	For the SUO, this principle will be absolutely necessary if we are
&gt;to achieve widespread take-up. We cannot afford to hide behind the cloak of
&gt;an artisan's guild.

I'm not trying to hide behind any cloaks or wanting to exclude 
anyone, but I am saying that this is to some extent a technical 
subject, and we have to assume a basic technical competence. Writing 
axioms for an ontology is at least as hard as writing, say, Java code.

&gt;GH3&gt;	I would prefer that we avoid esoteric language, and just say things
&gt;in plain English. For example, the essence of a wheeled vehicle is that it
&gt;incorporates one or more wheels on which it is capable of running to achieve
&gt;travel. I fully agree that we need to have an unambiguous language for
&gt;stating that, but we shouldn't forget that this sort of simple concept is
&gt;all we will be explaining for many instances in the SUO (cf. wheeled
&gt;ornament, and conceptual vehicle).

If only it were that simple. Starting from simple English sentences 
there is a huge terrain of analysis to cross before one can start 
writing axioms. The problem is that almost anything you say in 
English has hidden assumptions that need to be made explicit in an 
ontology. Take your example: what exactly does 'incorporate' mean? 
What does it mean to say that something is 'capable' of doing 
something? (What if it never it fact does that, like an auto that is 
put through a crash test immediately after manufacture: was that a 
wheeled vehicle?)  What does it mean to say that one kind of event 
makes something else 'achieve' something? What kind of claim is made 
by the assertion that something is travelling? (Is this saying that a 
certain kind of event exists? Or that a certain kind of state 
changes? Or that a certain kind of dynamic property is true of the 
moving thing? All of these will look very different when written 
axiomatically. Do you want them to entail each other? What are the 
general rules of such entailments?)

It might be worth reiterating a point of Doug Lenat's. People often 
think that Cyc is so called because it is a kind of encyclopedia, but 
that's wrong: Cyc is supposed to represent all the stuff that ISNT in 
the encyclopedia because the writers of the encyclopedia assume that 
their readers already 'know' it. That's the hard part of 
ontology-building.
