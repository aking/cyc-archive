and what about signs including &quot;altogether fictive&quot; as Peirce said?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; HP: Incidentally, this universal use of &quot;sign&quot; by Peirce is one of the causes he is
&gt; &gt;     often misunderstood by scientists and mathematicians (as well as normal people)
&gt; &gt;     who are accustomed to normal usage that implies a non-arbitrary, causal or
&gt; &gt;     active (verbal, non-displaceable, spatially and temporally) relation to its
&gt; &gt;     referent (e.g., fever is a sign or signature or signifier of disease).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; HP: A symbol usually implies an arbitrary passive (nominal, displaceable) relation
&gt; &gt;     to its referent.  This is consistent with etymology as well as common usage.
&gt; &gt;     (I think C.W. Morris develops this view.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I only quite recently realized why Peirce decided to use the word &quot;sign&quot; as
&gt; the generic term, whereas in his earliest published work he used &quot;sign&quot;
&gt; rather as the name for what he later called &quot;index&quot;.  Why the change from
&gt; the earlier usage when the earlier one seems to be the usage more consistent
&gt; with common sense usage?  I believe the reason is this.  
&gt; 
&gt; For one thing, Peirce's original motive for developing the theory of signs
&gt; was in the interest of establishing logic as a science, which requires that
&gt; its subject-matter by publicly observable.  Thus although his dictum that
&gt; &quot;all thought is in signs&quot; comes to have a number of different meanings, the
&gt; original sense of it was that we are to regard thought as present in
&gt; publicly available inscriptions and sounds, like marks on a blackboard or a
&gt; sheet or paper or in aural media, and thought as something hidden because
&gt; private is to be regarded as the special case, of no special interest to the
&gt; logician, anyway, until it gets publicly expressed.  (This is not to be
&gt; confused with a behaviorist conception of thought: that wasn't what he had
&gt; in mind.  What he had in mind was that thoughts are in the signs you see in
&gt; front of you as relational properties thereof, grounded in one way or
&gt; another in properties of the publicly available inscriptions: intrinsic
&gt; (i.e. monadic, qualitative), dyadic, or triadic properties, grounding,
&gt; respectively, what he later called iconic, indexical, and symbolic signs
&gt; respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, this doesn't fully account for it since he could have used some other
&gt; term for any sort of meaningful or significant entity and reserved the word
&gt; &quot;sign&quot; for indices only, which are signs of the type grounded in dyadic or
&gt; existential relationships, which is what you have in mind in your message, I
&gt; take it.  Now, we actually do find it fairly natural to refer to actual
&gt; inscriptions of symbols on a page or a blackboard as being signs, and Peirce
&gt; is certainly not the only theorist to refer to actually occurring symbols
&gt; and icons as being &quot;signs&quot;, but, nevertheless, there is apparently some
&gt; infelicity in his decision to use &quot;sign&quot; as the generic term, even given all
&gt; that I have said thus far, and it has always made me uneasy, too, even
&gt; though I could never come up with an alternative terminology set that
&gt; seemed, on balance, to be nearly as good.  
&gt; 
&gt; But then I noticed something the other day that had completely escaped my
&gt; attention all along that does seem to me to fully justify it, given ordinary
&gt; usage, namely, the fact that in treating meaningful entities as public in
&gt; the way indicated above, he was regarding thinking as a dialogical process,
&gt; too, and his decision to use the word &quot;sign&quot; as the generic term must have
&gt; been due to his realization that the development of logic as a theory of a
&gt; dialogical process -- which is what distinguishes his view from the usual
&gt; way of thinking of logic -- requires regarding the publicly available sound
&gt; or inscription as an actually occurring entity the significance of which is
&gt; to be responded to (i.e. interpreted).  That is, by using the word &quot;sign&quot; as
&gt; his technical term of art for the entity to be interpreted, he was, in
&gt; effect, requiring of the logician that the logican recognize that the
&gt; meaningful entity must first of all be understood by the interpreter in its
&gt; actual occurring or existential character, regardless of whether or not it
&gt; is its iconic or indexical or symbolic value that one is especially
&gt; interested in.  
&gt; 
&gt; Even if, say, one is interested in it primarily as a symbol, there is no
&gt; access to it as a symbol without prior understanding of its evidential value
&gt; as something actually occurring hic et nunc, i.e. at this time and this
&gt; place, i.e. its value as an index.  Peirce warns us of this in his
&gt; insistence that the replica of the symbol, the actually inscribed symbol, is
&gt; not itself the symbol proper, which is general whereas the replica is
&gt; singular.  My guess is that he just took it for granted that anybody
&gt; interested in the matter would understand that he was quite intentionally
&gt; drawing upon our ordinary understanding of &quot;sign&quot; as a resource, forcing us
&gt; in that way to regard thought as dialogical.  As usual, he over-rated his
&gt; readers.    
&gt; 
&gt; Thus it is symptomatic of our failure to understand what his most basic
&gt; logical move is, namely, to regard thought as essentially of the nature of a
&gt; dialogical process, that we do find it odd that he would use the word as he
&gt; does!  We say &quot;Oh, great idea that thought is dialogical! Peirce has such
&gt; good ideas!&quot; and then go right ahead and regard logic from the point of view
&gt; of monologue instead, and wonder idly, now and again, why we cannot seem to
&gt; get any mileage out of the idea of thought as dialogical after all!
&gt; 
&gt; Our hang-up here is that we cannot get out of the box built by the
&gt; architects of the so-called &quot;linguistic revolution&quot;, who have dominated 20th
&gt; Century thought in nearly every field concerned with meaning, who thought
&gt; you can say what words mean apart from any actual context of usage, and
&gt; regarded logic as the construction of an ideal system of some sort instead
&gt; of as a theory of the functional aspects of a process.
