Arisbeans, SUOphists, Countre Kin,

I am going to introduce, once again, a type of diagram
that I find to be of considerable use in picturing and
in tackling the complexities of this and a whole array
of similar formal subjects.

Let us consider yet another classical example of a triple of terms,
&lt;"Teachable", "Understanding", "Virtue"&gt;, which I regard as being
closely akin to the triple of &lt;"Techne", "Episteme", "Arete"&gt;,
in that order, respectively.

The ancient puzzle, whether virtue is teachable, which is to
imply by conversion, whether virtue is learnable, as opposed
to being acquired by some luck of an accidental draw, either
at birth, genetically speaking, or at some later day in life,
epigenetically speaking, just to mention a dicey pair of ways
among a random host of other ways that this quality of virtue
might be gained, and just so long as one concedes the unhappy
facts of the case that all of these ineffable ways must share,
and thus resigns oneself to the circumstances that the entire
lot of these so-called "ways" are amethodical, irrational, or
uncontrollable through the exercise of any deliberate purpose
that is known or knowable to us, in our specious condition as
fallible and mortal, finite information creatures, like I was
trying to say before I so rusely interrupreted myself, I take
this to be a paradigmatic example of a whole set of questions,
all of them having to do with the problem of the relationship
between something that impresses us as like unto divinity, or
infinity, or otherwise ineffable and transcendental in nature,
and something else that we take to be rather more nearly akin
to our own nature, effable, familiar, finite, graspable as if
nigh-intuitively by our limited senses and finite intellects.

And this very kind of question, about the relationship between
finity and infinity, is what a lot of mathematics is all about,
and especially what the theory of computation and recursion is
all about.

Taking the topic of "Virtue" as paradigmatic of the "Apparently Transcendental",
the topic of "Understanding" as paradigmatic of the "Rationally Apprehensible",
and the topic of "Teachable" as paradigmatic of the "Methodically Achievable",
I can diagram what Plato appears, at least, to say about their relationship,
in a variety of places (for example, in the 'Meno'), as follows:

      T
      o
      ^^
      | \
      |  \
      |   \
      |    \
    ? |     o U
      |    ^
      |   /
      |  / ?
      | /
      |/
      o
      V

I will be using diagrams of this same abstract sort under any one of several
different interpretations, initially in a syllogistic or a lattice-theoretic
vein, ultimately with a relational or a category-theoretic spin to be placed
on their reading, as if overlaid on the implicational meanings of the arrows.

When Aristotle gets around to discussing this question, which he does almost
in passing as a throw-away example of "apagoge" ("abduction" or "reduction"),
he is manifestly engaged in the last acts of the 'Prior Analytics', in which
treatise he uses throughout a couple of different idioms for delineating the
relationships of terms and propositions in the arguments known as syllogisms.

One of these idioms, in so far as the propositional aspect of reasoning goes,
is much like the manner of reasoning to which a majority of us are likely to
have become accustomed, indicating the terms of propositions in the familiar
order that is followed by our current usage of the sign "=&gt;" for implication.

For example, converting our example into a bald if a bold assertion, we have:

| Case:  V =&gt; U
| Rule:  U =&gt; T
|---------------
| Fact:  V =&gt; T

In other words:

| If it happens to be the Case that Virtue is a variety of Understanding,
| And if it is the Rule that every variety of Understanding is Teachable,
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Tnen it is a conclusive Fact that Virtue itself is among the Teachable.

To be perfectly honest, I do not know whether any of these guys,
Socrates or Plato or Aristotle, actually intends to assert this --
I used to think I knew, until Kierkegaard and Cornford, between
the two of them, rendered me utterly confused about the problem --
and that is why I have attached question marks to the premisses,
to indicate what appears to be safe enough to reckon as certain,
in any case, from the immediate textual loci of the discussions
themselves, that a form of reduction of an initial question, or
via an instance of abductive metamorphosis, is being considered
as a way of facing the question of whether Virtue can be Taught.

It may be of interest to mention at this juncture the character of
Aristotle's alternative idiom for describing the formal structures
of syllogisms, a figurative way of writing that is very suggestive
of geometric diagrams that may have once accompanied the text, now
lost, perhaps, through the iconoclastic inclinations of the Arabic
scribes through whom we recovered many of our lost arts of thought,
like the disc formats that I have from a decade ago whose graphics
are now forever, it appears, or not, as good as gone from my sight.

Where was I -- oh yes, Aristotle's alternative idiom for depicting
syllogisms.  As it happens, this is the idiom from which we derive,
by way of a Latin translation, the name "predicate", on account of
the circumstance that the "predicate" is "spoken or written before"
the corresponding "subject" of the "proposition".  In our example:

| Rule:  TU, read "T of U"
| Case:  UV, read "U of V"
|--------------------------
| Fact:  TV, read "T of V"

And this way accords with ways of labeling geonetric figures
that have been used by mathematicaians from times e-memorial.

      T
      o
      ^^
      | \
      |  \ TU
      |   \
      |    \
   TU |     o U
      |    ^
      |   /
      |  / UV
      | /
      |/
      o
      V

One last metaphor-maze, and then I think I shall call it a daze:
It is often convenient to employ the topological transformation
that is commonly known as "stretching a point" (SAP) to convert
this triangle into the semblance of a trapezoid with its bottom
edge "identified" all along its length, "quotiented to a point",
as they say, topologically speaking.

    T o
      ^^
      | \
      |  \
      |   \
      |    \
   TV |     o U
      |     ^
      |     |
      |     | UV
      |     |
      |     |
    V o=====o V

By converting the taproot of the triangle into a more rhizomic saproot,
its is possible more easily to draw a runing series of transformations.

E-Nuff For E-Now,

Jon Awbrey
