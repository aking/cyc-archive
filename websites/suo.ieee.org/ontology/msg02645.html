&gt; &gt; Josiane,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Before I delve into the details of this protocol,
&gt; &gt; I need to preamble a bit on two preliminary points.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First, what are the larger reasons that we should be
&gt; &gt; interested in such things in a group that is devoted to
&gt; &gt; developing an engineering standard for computable ontology?
&gt;
&gt; Josiane wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; Jon, I can give you an enumeration,
&gt; you have already treat my approach
&gt; as a dogmatic one.

Communication is always so difficult.
There does not seem to be anything else
for it but to keep on trying until you
get to know a person better.  I was only
speaking abstractly about different ways
that people can choose to operate, and
so it is purely a strategic matter that
needs to be reflected on after the fact.

Now I take a point of view that may not be the
most popular one here, and I always seem to be
annoying people with continual pesky questions
and my undischarged childhood curiousity about
"Where do ontolgies come from, anyway?"  There
are many people who behave as if they believed,
though I am sure that they would not say so if
they paused to reflect for even a moment, that
my question of "ontologogenesis" has an answer
that goes just a liitle bit like the following:

| Prophet P ascends Mountain M
| and receives Ontology (Big O)
| on the metaphorical "tablets"
| of revelant Sacred Source SS.

Although I admit the abstract possibility of this oracular answer,
I think that one has less frequent recourse to it in modern times,
and so I am led to inquire into the possibility of other paths to
the ontological revelation.  And this is the greater issue that I
must strive to keep in mind as we contemplate various examples of
problem-solving action among finite and mortal, fallibly informed
creatures, such as I guess myself to be from all present evidence.

So, let us ask ourselves:

| What is the problem to which an ontology is the solution?
| What is the question to which an ontology is the answer?
| What is the start state and what is the aim of it all?
| What is the ontology problem space that one transits?

If I keep these questions before us I will feel that
I have shouldered my duty to the sense of this quest.

&gt; So I prefer to give you some examples.
&gt; Then I will use them to try to answer you.
&gt; 
&gt; (Jus, 10 years, trial 3)
&gt;
&gt; (4)(3)(12)    (1 = rose (little), 2 = vert, 3 = jaune, 4 = noir (big))
&gt;
&gt; ============================================================
&gt;  1 - après le rose je le mets en premier pour
&gt;      après mettre le vert à côté du jaune
&gt;      (14)(3)(2)
&gt;
&gt;  2 - le vert je vais le mettre comme ça
&gt;
&gt;  3 - bon le vert sur le jaune
&gt;      (14)(23)()
&gt;
&gt;  4 - le rose sur le vert
&gt;      (4)(123)()
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt;  5 - après je mets le noir en dernier
&gt;      ()(123)(4)
&gt;
&gt;  6 - le rose je le mets en premier parce que
&gt;      autrement le vert y aura un problème
&gt;      (1)(23)(4)
&gt;
&gt;  7 - après le vert je le mets en dernier sur le noir
&gt;      (1)(3)(14)
&gt;
&gt; ****************************************************************
&gt;
&gt;  8 - bon ben alors le rose je le mets aussi en dernier
&gt;      ()(3)(124)
&gt;
&gt;  9 - ah non ça va pas
&gt;
&gt; 10 - non le rose je le mets en deuxième
&gt;      ()(13)(24)
&gt; 
&gt; This passage is interesting because it shows two hierarchical sructures
&gt; that has to be taken in consideration for defining the context:
&gt; 
&gt; a - one has already been presented in my precedent
&gt;     mail (mail of Fri, 18 May 2001 00:15:14,
&gt;     The Very Model Of A Dogmatic Razor) and
&gt;     concerns organizations at situational level:
&gt;     here disk 1 is located to disk 2 (repetition of
&gt;     'le vert' in 3 and 4).  At enunciative level, only
&gt;     disks 1 and 2 are selected (criteria;  anaphore 'le'),
&gt;     the two other disks 3 and 4 stay at situational level;
&gt;     furthermore, disk 2 is located to disk 1 in 1-2 (connective
&gt;     'pour qu'après', et en 6-7 (connective 'parce que').  So it
&gt;     is sufficient for the participant to focus his attention on
&gt;     disk 1 at enunciative level, disk 2 is in the background.
&gt;     And all the other elements and moves were deposite and
&gt;     structured in external environment.

Now, from my "unbiased perspective" (UP), what I notice is that
a couple of people, called "Experiencer" E and "Experimenter" E',
have two different ways of describing the action that E "performs"
and that E' "observes".  This leads to many interesting reflections.
What dynamic forces differentially drive concept formation in E &amp; E'?

&gt; b - The second hierarchy corresponds to the structure of episods.
&gt;     The criteria are connectives and thematic organizations.
&gt;     In this sequence, one a main episod starts in 8 (accumulation
&gt;     'bon ben alors' + le rose je), a second level of episod appears
&gt;     in 1 (with only the connective 'après' + le rose je), and a third
&gt;     in 5 (with après, but without anaphore);  this hierarchie give us
&gt;     the organisation of chunks, i.e. the constitution of more or less
&gt;     complex agregates.
&gt; 
&gt; There were a lot of other things to say here, but my aim is to try
&gt; to answer Jon's question 'what are the larger reasons that should be
&gt; interesting for developing a computable ontology?'
&gt;
&gt; Some hints for a formal caracterisation of context?
&gt; Why not the problem of articulation between symbol and indice?
&gt; Interaction between external and internal representation?
&gt;
&gt; I think you noticed that the analysis was drawn very carefully
&gt; with mention of formal criteria at every step.  So if given
&gt; a problem solving strategy you may also envisage a computable
&gt; production of corresponding verbalizations.
&gt;
&gt; At last my research was developped in the french tradition
&gt; (linguistics of Benveniste, and Piaget)

I studied Piaget in depth at two different times in my life,
but both of these explorations were quite some time ago now.

&gt; I stop here.  There are a lot of other raesons,
&gt; I don't want to give you an enumeration.
&gt; 
&gt; Before to break to-day, I will give you an example with interjection.
&gt; It concerns an adult protocol Lydie, trial 1, for the 5-disks Tower
&gt; 
&gt; (problem state at the begining of this passage : 5 - 4 - 321 )
&gt; 
&gt; d'accord d'accord donc je suis avec le 5 sur le A le 4 sur le B
&gt; les trois autres sur le C
&gt;
&gt; donc j'essaie de faire repasser ceux qui sont sur le C sur
&gt; un piton précédent est-ce-que je peux util...prendre?
&gt;
&gt; (N.B. the participant wants to take two disks at the same time,
&gt; the experimentor reminds him the instructions: one disk only at a time)
&gt;
&gt; ah oui oui c'est logique
&gt;
&gt; ah ben je repasse le disque 4 sur le A
&gt; (45)( )(123)
&gt;
&gt; pour essayer de dégager ce qui se trouve en C
&gt; oh la la
&gt;
&gt; Alors je mets le 2 sur le A
&gt;       je repasse le 1 ici
&gt;       je repasse le 3 en B
&gt; (123)(3)( )
&gt; 
&gt; Here the interesting fact stands in the interjection 'oh la la',
&gt; and in the change of linguistic form which follows the interjection.
&gt; A minimal interpretation is to say that the participant has constructed
&gt; a new operator of the problem space.

Hmm.  There was a writer, Arthur Koestler, whose book 'Act of Creation'
had as one of the elements of its main thesis something very similar --
a notion of "bisociation", where two planes of association intersect,
as in the phenomenon of a "pun".  And then there is all of Freud.

&gt; It can be possible to explicit this operator from linguistic analysis,
&gt; and also to caracterise at least partly the context (conditions) of
&gt; this operator.
&gt; 
&gt; I wrote two papers on interjections, but in french.
&gt; If you are interexted, I can give you the references.

Yes.

&gt; Jon wrote:
&gt;
&gt; For my part, I would say that a general study of problem-solving
&gt; is very material to solving problems, and problems are something
&gt; of which we have a plenty here!  (&lt;&lt;&lt;---&lt;&lt;&lt; Big Interjection).
&gt; 
&gt; Josiane:
&gt; 
&gt; Jon, your caricature of problem solving is right.
&gt; Recent and important papers on ToH considers only the
&gt; number of trials in order to achieve two consecutive times
&gt; the optimal solution.  And if the participant is too much long
&gt; they stop him.  They are based on performance, and they do not
&gt; concern a semiotic approach of verbalizations.  I don't think
&gt; I have to be put in this class.  The difference between me and
&gt; them is the same than the difference between a pragmatic approach
&gt; integrated to semantic and a propositional one.  I can retreive any
&gt; classical result but I have to elaborate every theoretical step of
&gt; my pragmatic approach, and also the appropriate terminology.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon:
&gt;
&gt; But is there really something so generic that it rises above
&gt; the "family dissemblances" of these seemingly diverse games?
&gt; That is a question that may take a thoughtful person not
&gt; a little while to answer.
&gt; 
&gt; Josiane:
&gt; Yes, above the family dissemblances,
&gt; linked to the diversity of language,
&gt; there are a lot of regularities.

Here I was speaking about the very remote family resemblances, if any,
that may conceivably exist between activities that appear so diverse
as the TOH puzzle and the "Testable Ontological Hierarchy" business.

&gt; I will give you just some examples:
&gt; 
&gt; - first I thnk you know the triangle of ToH (the problem space of all the
&gt; possible states), with the optimal strategy on the right of the triangle.
&gt; A condition for staying on the optimal strategy at step (4)(3)(12) is to
&gt; focus attention on disk 2.  If it is the participant can stay in the same
&gt; problem space, disk 1 is in the background (for example at situational level)?
&gt; and if she or he thinks of disk 2 as the disk 1 was before, it is tha same
&gt; problem as before, and she or he can stay on the optimal strategy. But if
&gt; there is no focus, or if the focus is on disk 1, and if the participant
&gt; continue in the same problem space, then she or he left the optimal
&gt; stategy and goes inside the triangle.
&gt; 
&gt; - Generaly the main goal is to put disk 4 on the goal peg (4 disks ToH),
&gt; but very often it is not, participants focus more on critical goals, for
&gt; example concerning moves of disk 2.  Generally also there are connectives
&gt; and demarcation of episods just before the move of disk 4 to goal peg
&gt; (cf in 5 for example given above : Jus)
&gt; 
&gt; Jon:
&gt; Second, I need to know your attitude toward the circumstance that
&gt; the TOH game is not, game-theoreticaly speaking, a genuine game,
&gt; since there is no "strategy" to it, by which I mean that it has
&gt; a "deterministically unique minimal solution" (DUMS), and once
&gt; a person discovers that, then there is no more problem to it.
&gt; 
&gt; Josiane:
&gt; It is right, but I found the resolution of ToH still very complex.
&gt; And in a first time I prefer to continue with.  To-morrow I will
&gt; give you other interesting examples.
&gt; 
&gt; But it is possible to give a generalisation of the analysis if we know the
&gt; meaning of linguistic marks, and especially how contextual parameters work
&gt; through this meaning.  I did some works - and my husband too - to caracterize
&gt; the schéma de sens and contextual parameters of some linguistic marks.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not know if my answer satisfy you.
&gt; If not I will continue to-morrow,
&gt; because now I am tired.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours
&gt; Josiane

It appears to me that the insight which leads to
an instant recognition of the least action orbit
depends on mentally or physically re-organizing
the board topology, thus:

                                      A
                                      o
                                     / \
o---------o---------o   &gt;&gt;&gt;---&gt;&gt;&gt;   /   \
A         B         C              /     \
                                  o-------o
                                 B         C

This would constitute a true "Ah-Hah" experience!
