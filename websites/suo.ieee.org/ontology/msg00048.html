Adam, Chris, Ian, &amp; KIF'n Cousins All,

I had been reserving my comments on this translation
of John Sowa's "Top Level Categories" (TLC) into KIF
until such time as the author himself could have his
say on the result.  As that earnestly to be desired
outcome does not appear to be forthcoming any time
soon, or in any sort of direct way, and it has just
now occurred to me -- duh! -- that perhaps this has
already happened in one of those apparently all the
more frequent off-list discussion and decision-making
bodies with which this ostensibly "open" forum has now
saddled itself, I guess that I might as well go ahead
and toss my tuppence worth into the pot, as it were.

I would like to try and make at least one thing clear right here
at the beginning, so that nobody takes any of this too personally
or too pointedly, namely, that most of what I have to say is not
specific to KIF, not by any means, but would apply equally well
to that whole tradition of formalities in logic that have come
to be foist-order-lodged in our intellects by the lights and
by the likes of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein.

I also think that it might contribute to our mutual understanding
if I explain one or two aspects of my own background.  I was not
always this skeptical about the potential of FOL as we know it --
I came by my aporetics quite honestly, in the way that I have had
to learn all of my lessons, the hard way, through disappointment
in following through with my former beliefs.  I was once in fact
what you might call a "True Believer" in the point of view that
used to be known as "logicism", namely, the idea that every form
of mathematical reasoning reduces to a matter of deductive logic.
This is the POV that I took into my graduate studies in maths,
and this is the POV that I revived yet another time when I set
about trying to develop qualitative methods in psychology, and
this is the angle at which I just had to keep on butting my head,
one more time for good measure, when I tried to integrate my early
efforts into a try at AI.  Now, a person takes an obvious risk in
airing out his own failed trials in this way -- it is so easy for
anybody to say "Well, that's just him" and go back to trying the
same old, same old things for all that anybody's worth, one more
time, with a few innovations, always a few more novelties to try.

But I will go ahead, anyway, and state the lesson that I, for one,
learned from my honest, if naive, attempts, and that is just that
formalisms like the "logic of deductive inference" (LODI) and the
"theory of classes and sets" (TOCAS) are perfectly -- well, almost
perfectly -- good forms of representation for succintly summarizing
what you have discovered, at any rate, once you have discovered it
usually by any other means possible, in what is often called the
"context of justification and review" (COJAR), but that these
brands of formalism are darn near useless and a positivistic
nuisance when it comes to the discovery phases of the overall
"context of inquiry" (COI) itself.

Well, all of my pre-ambling took longer than I thought it would,
and so I will have to break now and try to get back to the main
part of your translation piece later.

Cheers,

Jon Awbrey

&gt;    Here is an SUO-KIF version of John Sowa's upper level ontology
&gt; thanks to Chris Menzel and Ian Niles.  All comments are welcome.

&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;; The "nth-domain" provides a computationally and heuristically
&gt; ;; convenient mechanism for declaring the intended types of the

&gt; ;; genuine predicate in a standard first-order language as it takes
&gt; ;; first-order predicates as arguments.  Furthermore, it also takes
&gt; ;; numerals as arguments, which are not part of first-order languages
&gt; ;; generally.  However, it can be understood formally as an abbreviation
&gt; ;; as follows.
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;; Let REL be any n-place predicate, and let M be the numeral
&gt; ;; for the positive integer m, where m is less than or equal to n.
&gt; ;; Then we let
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;   (nth-domain REL M CLASS)

&gt; ;;           (=&gt; (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
&gt; ;;               (instance-of VAR_m CLASS)))
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;; More generally, let M_1, ..., M_i be the numerals for
&gt; ;; positive integers m_1, ..., m_i, ordered by size, all
&gt; ;; less than or equal to n.  Then, in general, we let
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;   (nth-domain REL M_1 CLASS_1 ... M_i CLASS_i)
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;; abbreviate
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;   (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
&gt; ;;           (=&gt; (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)

&gt; 
&gt; ;; THE LANGUAGE OF SOWA'S UPPER LEVEL ONTOLOGY
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;; This ontology uses a first-order modal language, i.e.,
&gt; ;; a first-order language with the sentence operators "nec"
&gt; ;; (for "necessarily") and "poss" (for "possibly").  Primitive
&gt; ;; constants, primitive predicates, and defined predicates are
&gt; ;; listed below.  Note that among the primitive predicates are
&gt; ;; several (e.g., "exists-at") that are borrowed from other ontologies --
&gt; ;; moreover, those predicates may be *defined* in those ontologies.
&gt; ;; Eventually, of course, it will be important to have mechanisms
&gt; ;; for making such connections explicitly (via, e.g., something
&gt; ;; like Ontolingua packages).

&gt;  A history is a proposition (RA) that relates some script (IAO) to

&gt;  is a script (IAO);  a computer executing the program is a process (IPO);

&gt;  need not have any relationship to anything else, a relative entity must

&gt;  a relationship between two other entities.  An example of a mediating entity

&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Occurrent  "An entity that does not have a stable identity
&gt;  during any interval of time.  Formally, Occurrent is a primitive that
&gt;  satisfies the following axioms: \
&gt;    * The temporal parts of an occurrent, which are called stages,
&gt;      exist at different times. \
&gt;    * The spatial parts of an occurrent, which are called participants,
&gt;      may exist at the same time, but an occurrent may have different
&gt;      participants at different stages.\
&gt;    * There are no identity conditions that can be used to identify
&gt;      two occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions. \
&gt;
&gt; (NOTE:  The notions identity conditions and observation are not axiomatized
&gt;  in this ontology, so this is not an actual axiom of the ontology, unlike the
&gt;  two axioms above.  (Though those two required adding some notions that are only
&gt;  implicit in Sowa's ontology, e.g., the relations "exists-at" and "located-at".)
&gt;  A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent.  Different stages of a life
&gt;  cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant, such as the person's
&gt;  fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable identity conditions at each stage.
&gt;  Even then, the identification depends on an inference that presupposes the uniqueness
&gt;  of the identity conditions.")

&gt;  of detail, the same actual entity may be viewed as a stable object or

&gt;  some entity or entities.  In logic, the assertion of a proposition
&gt;  is a claim that the abstraction corresponds to some aspect or configuration
&gt;  of the entity or entities involved.  As an example, the statement cat(Yojo)
&gt;  expresses a proposition that the form labeled Cat characterizes the entity
&gt;  named Yojo.  According to Peirce and Whitehead, more complex propositions

&gt;  history (RAO);  and the intention (MA) that explains the situation (MPO)
&gt;  is a purpose (MAO).  The basic axioms for Purpose are inherited from its
&gt;  supertypes Mediating, Abstract, and Occurrent.  Some lower level axioms
&gt;  relate purposes to actions and agents:
&gt;  (1) Time sequence.  If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose
&gt;      is a situation z, the start of y occurs before the start of z.
&gt;  (2) Contingency.  If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose is
&gt;      a situation z described by a proposition p, then it is possible
&gt;      that z might not occur or that p might not be true of z.
&gt;  (3) Success or failure.  If an agent x performs an act y whose purpose
&gt;      is a situation z described by a proposition p, then x is said to be
&gt;       successful if z occurs and p is true of z. otherwise, x is said to
