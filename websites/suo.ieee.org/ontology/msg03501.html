¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Matthew,

I continue from where I left off last time.

JA = Jon Awbrey
JS = Jim Schoening
MW = Matthew West

JA: I'm having to deal off the top of my inbox now,
    and so I may have missed previous discussion.
    Also, not sure people are really capable
    of hearing each other here, and I need
    to continue with long-run increments
    of progress, so I may appear a bit
    scattered, or have to be sporadic.
    Maybe things will look different
    when I get my health back.
    Interspersals infra.

MW: This sounds encouraging.
    See comments below.

MW: However, you have frequently suggested that the only sort of document
    that you find acceptable is something that purports to be a standard
    ontology, which doesn't leave those of us that think there are some
    pre-requisites anywhere much to go.

JS: Agreed.  My use of the term &quot;standards words&quot; is too narrow.
    In your other post you gave some examples of pre-standards words:

JS, quoting MW:
 
    | - statement of requirements
    | - standing documents for internal procedures
    | - documents providing background theory/approach
    |   taken/proposed for the development of a standard.

JS: I agree these are all valid for documents, but not for extended threads.
    We must balance volume with how directly it contributes.  Jon's postings
    are too remote for his volume.  He could post papers or introduce threads,
    but he should not continue the threads on this list.

JA: The future always looks like it is more or less remote,
    but it has the darndest funny way of sneaking up on us.

MW: I agree that Jon should prepare and post papers, rather than &quot;slow print&quot;
    them to the list.  I would prefer that from a reading point of view too.

JA: There is an important aspect of the way that I am trying
    to contribute my knowledge here that some people do not
    seem to get yet, although most of my other off-list
    dialogue partners do -- folks, by the way, who are
    too intimidated by the general tenor of the VIP's
    conduct on the list to dare the asking of an
    innocent question on-list, much to our
    detriment and our common loss,
    I might add ---

MW: That is sad.

JA: Just so.

JA: and this is that my whole present way of working is really
    dialogic.  I know, it may look like a monologue from the
    more disengaged points ofview, but it's not, and I get
    just enough interaction to tell when things have to
    be said another way, or a thousand other ways,
    to get through.  

MW: Well then for me you are talking too fast.
    If you could talk at half the speed, and
    pause occassionally when there are other
    conversations, I would not find myself
    having to ignore what you are saying
    from time to time.

JA: Yes, asynchrony is a well-known problem,
    even in this medium that was e-spousedly
    designed to thrive on it.  Most probably,
    there is a bit more to this predicament
    than the mythical bandwith of e-mediacy.

JA: I have recently had the experience of spending ten years
    as a hermit in a cave working in near total isolation on
    my dissertation, and I can tell you, I am not going back
    to that, so get used to it.

MW: I fear you may be letting the pendulum swing too far in the other direction.

JA: I will learn from observing the dynamics of the system.

MW: I see Jon's contributions as towards a future, rather than current document.
 
JS: If this were true, he could surely show 'some' early words.
 
JA: Where is our list of standards words?

JA: This was an honest, and I thought at the time, a simple question.
    I have not been able to understand the statements that I have
    heard made about &quot;standards words&quot;, but the people speaking
    appeared to be so definite about it that I thought it must
    be some &quot;term of art&quot; unknown to me, or else defined in
    some concrete document somewhere that I had missed,
    aside from the S&amp;P, which I have read.  So I asked
    a simple question.  It seems that the word &quot;simple&quot;
    has a double meaning.  Always my downfall.
    I await clarification of this issue,
    whatever form it may take.

JA: Frank Farance made the same complaint,
    and I drafted an attempt in response,
    but he never replied.  Frankly, it
    just seems that we do not even have
    the critical mass of expertise that
    it takes to do this on a wide front,
    no matter what certain folks might
    think they are can do in a &quot;let's
    pretend we know something about X&quot;
    sort of way.  This is premature,
    if not immature, and it will only
    lead to bringing down severe and
    damning criticism on our heads
    from the first external review
    by any actual expertise group.
    I do not imagine myself to be
    anything but a generalist here,
    but I've been through the ringers
    of enough specialized disciplines
    to know this much.  It'll happen.

MW: He has shown lots of early words.
    The whole Functional Logic thread
    is early words.

JS: OK, let's take this as an example.
    Let me ask some questions (keeping
    in mind I don't follow Jon's threads).

JS: He should have started out by proposing a draft of
    those words, or writing a paper and asking for review.

MW: Yes, I think this would have been better.

JS: I'm guessing he started the thread and did his ongoing exploration.

JA: No, you guess wrong.

JA: It is really silly to try and judge what you do not read.
    Not that you're the only person who does this, of course.
    And it is equally silly of me to try and argue with folks
    who do not read what they judge.

MW: No. It looks like he had prepared a paper, and then
    broken it up into chunks which he sent to the list.
    I would prefer he sent 5-10 page chunks as PDF files
    with an executive summary e-mail.

JS: Did he wrap up his final version and
    present it for review and acceptance?

MW: No, but this is largely because you give him no place
    to do it since the only documents you have deemed
    appropriate are ontology standards documents.

JA: Look, I have a set piece of work that bears on the aims of this group.
    Many foundational portions of it were developed between 1967 and 1992.
    The actual writing of this work into the form of a dissertation in the
    field of Systems Engineering was done from 1992 to 2000, with ongoing
    cosmetic changes up until the present time.  Over the last year in the
    SUO WG I have changed my writing style, which I routinely do whenever
    I write a lot, whether programming, prose, or poetry, and I have even
    changed my research direction and focus a bit &quot;under the infuence&quot; of
    SUO WG norms and goals.  Independently of these developments, one of
    my advisors with considerable expertise in software reusability from
    within a relational programming paradigm has developed an interest
    in description logics and ontological applications.  So I could be
    in this for the long haul.

MW: I'd be interested in hearing about any practical programmes
    you and your colleagues are working on.

JA: I will keep you posted.

JA: Of course, there is a big difference between the style of a formal dissertation
    and the cross of a practical application.  So it is necessary to keep plugging
    away at applicable ways of saying what it all means in practice.  Easier said
    than done, as I'm sure you know.

JS: Does it relate to either starter document?

MW: No, it precedes both of them.
    In my categories above it is
    background/theory/approach.

JA: It relates to both of the starter documents to the differential
    extents that both of them are still trying to represent their
    ontologies in KIF, and KIF in its current form will fail as
    a representation language, both on the grounds of its
    inherent pragmatic inadequacies, and on the grounds
    that no one from the mathematical community, at
    the very least, would ever try to do use it
    for any significant task.

Again, I have no special collection of axes to grind or bones to pick with KIF --
never even heard of it until a year or so ago -- bur I have been examining the
syntactic, semantic, semiotic, and general pragmatic properties of languages,
natural and technical, gross and subtle, for as long as I can remember, and
I crafted my first experimental langauge for a specific technical purpose
somewheres about in the 4th grade.  As far as logical calculi go, I pretty
much quit using, for the sake of my own thinking, the notational system that
builds so shakily on the familiar alphabet {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ...}
as soon as I happened on the far more exacting and the far more powerful, for
all conceptual and practical purposes, logical sytems of Charles Sanders Peirce
and George Spencer Brown, sometime in the period 1967-1969, some very fuzzy years.
I gradually grew and scruffily sctibbled these two genre of logical graphs on paper
constantly, working in parallel under both the &quot;entitative&quot; and the &quot;existential&quot;
interpretations, and eventually evolved a few extensions of my own, discovering
the item that I sometimes still call the &quot;boundary operator&quot;, on analogy with
a construct that figures mightily in algebraic topology, on the period around
1976-1980, some more hazy days.  This operator is the germinal root of both
the &quot;reflective&quot; and the &quot;differential&quot; extensions logical graphs, that
now constitute Ref Log and Dif Log, respectively.

So, to make a long story bear on the current point of application,
I would criticize in the just same way any concrete syntax that
proposes to use the factitious family of specious primitives
that are commonly symbolized by the means of the unsouper
alphabet {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ...} and its ilk.
There are compelling formal and overwhelming practical
reasons for regarding any such system with the same
sort of disregard that anybody would have for the
unhappy motley of roman numerals, if shanghaied
as a crew in a futile venture to pirate the
differential and integral calculus.

I have mentioned all of these facts with all due consistency from
the very beginning of my service here, long before I ever dreamed
that something called &quot;KIF&quot; would become an issue -- it was when
David Whitten first asked for feedback on a Starter Ontology,
if I recall -- and the only thing that surprised me then
and still shocks me today is that it was news to anybody
in a group that numbered such lights as I regarded JSF
to be.  And the fact that I must report this anywhere
else but on the Main is to me a sign that some folks
have indeed understood perfectly clearly what I have
been saying all along, a leading indicator of just
how much force of arms lies behind certain fixed
arrays of economic and hidebound interests, and
a symptom of just how sick the dynamics of
a group can become, whenever it abdicates
its duty to inquiry under the influence
of that whole ilk of unreasoning force.

Have to break here ...

Jon Awbrey

MW: I recall this now you mention it, but missed it in my summary
    of what I think you are about below.  I'd like to understand
    better why you think KIF is inadequate.  For example is it:

MW: 1. The notation is obscure and difficult for humans to read
       and understand (but convenient for computers).

MW: 2. KIF is an ASCIIfication of First Order Logic, and FOL is inadequate
       to the task at hand (if so please explain why and what is needed).

MW: 3. KIF does not give adequate support for semiotics (or some other key theory).

MW: For myself, I don't like KIF, but I think I can live with it.

JA: People learn to live with many things.

But those who do not study the story of Nazi and Soviet and Taliban history
are doomed to repeat it.  It all begins with infinitesimal, incre-mental,
inconspicuous, and innocuous, all too inncocuous abuses of power.

JA: The question is whether we can think
    of a better tool for the task at hand.
    I already have.  This is not arrogance.
    The ground was broken, and the groundwork
    laid by Peirce long ago -- Existential Graphs
    and Conceptual Graphs are in the same ballpark --
    I have added a few improvements of my own that
    I happen to like and the utilities of which it
    is my job to demonstrate.  I could do this if
    I am ever given half a chance.

JA: We would be far better off just
    writing the standard out in plain
    math/logic monograph style. 

MW: I don't see how this helps interoperability between computer systems.

JA: It is like the development, the initial definition, and the
    eventual formal specification of any programming language,
    say, Lisp or Pascal, just the last ones that I used a lot.
    Wirth's and McCarthy's standards began as plain papers in
    the usual computing science, logi, and mathematical styles.
    McCarthy continued to use his language of M-expressions as
    the definitive source and the medium of communication with
    himself, even when nobody else understood why it was needed,
    over and above the language of compu'terpri'able S-expressions
    that all the world knows as Lisp.  To me this is quite plain.
    He was, and still is, addressing the Ages.

JA: I am definitely not saying that we should not seek a computationally
    implemented language.  Indeed, I would insist that we must at least
    develop the prototype &quot;test of concept&quot;, and usually many of them,
    in order to know if what we specify has a practical realization.
    Indeed, that may be the only useful thing that we can do here --
    and it would put the reductive examples of ontologies that we
    have been cudgeling our brains about in their proper light,
    namely, as little more than &quot;test data structures&quot; for
    the evaluation of the implicit, as yet vaporware,
    ontology maintainance software.  I know the
    &quot;receiver operating characteristocs&quot; of
    many of our prospective user groups,
    and I know that this is exactly how
    they would view our feeble SUO's, as
    just so many &quot;dumb textbook examples&quot;,
    of some use in paidagogy, nothing more.

JA: I am trying to help you with that problem, by delivering a new language
    to you that solves the fundamental problems in a fundamental way.  

MW: So is that the real purpose of your ASCIIfied notation?

No, the asciification is in direct response to a request from Chris Menzel.

JA: The basement is dug ...

MW: It being ...?

JA: My whole work in logic, graph theory, formal language theory,
    computer science, sign relational semiotics, systems theory,
    in sum, inquiry driven systems.

MW: You know it would be really handy to see the plans ...

JA: This is a what my dissertation is,
    a portion of which I am presently
    elaborating and expositing on the
    Ontology List.

JA and the building of the next story is admittedly incomplete,
   but the fundamental medium is planned out right for what is
   probably the first time in history.

MW: But (assuming this is so) at present only in your head.

JA: No, I implemented the basic &quot;test of concept&quot; all through the 80's,
    a Pascal program that is entitled &quot;Theme One&quot;, and that I still use
    today as my main &quot;Propositional Calculator&quot; for any complex problem,
    and submitted it in partial fulfilment of the requirements for my
    Master's in Quantitative Psych at Michigan State University (1989).
    I then adopted this as the ground floor of my current PhD programme
    in Systems Engineering at Oakland University in Michigan, and I have
    been building on that basis with due diligence up until this moment.

JA: And now a few haunting refrains from the overture:

JA: <A  HREF="http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm">http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm</A>

JA: (The advertizing group has requested a #bold statement# for its copy.)

MW: Not the kind of summary of where you are going I had in mind.

JA: &quot;Where no one has gone before ...&quot;

JA: Bold statements make me weary -- I have will have to break here.

JA: Still having trouble getting past this point.

JS: If so, did he formally propose it to them and explain how it fits?
    If not, please explain its contribution.

MW: Jon's paper presents some foundations of logic which he thinks
    are important to set out as the basis for what is to follow.
    This is important, because as you will already have seen,
    logic, and some of the stuff immediately around it, is
    not as cut and dried as we might like to think.  There
    are choices to be made, and these should be made
    explicitly. As you may conclude from his exchange
    with CM, there is nothing earth shattering here.

MW: Jon's main contention that this is all leading to is that
    the &quot;big problem&quot; we really face is ontology development,
    rather than a specific ontology, and that we need amongst
    other things to specify and develop tools for this purpose.
    This would support an &quot;enquiry&quot; process which would support
    the interaction between ontology developers to help them
    resolve issues and move forwards.  He correctly identifies
    semiotics (for practical purpose the relationships between
    terms and meanings) as a key element in this.

MW: The main reason I am bothering to mediate here is that I have
    enough experience from my base standards community to know that
    he is right about these things. If we think we are going to create
    anything significant by hand coding KIF files, we don't understand
    the problem, but that is where we are right now.

JS: He is welcome to do his exploring on the Ontology list,
    but it doesn't belong on the SUO list.  If we met in person, 
    he wouldn't be permitted to do about a quarter of the talking
    on these types of topics.

MW: This is why I suggested essentially renaming
    the ontology list to the development list.

JS: Jon, would you agree to do your work on a 
    'development' list if we created done?
