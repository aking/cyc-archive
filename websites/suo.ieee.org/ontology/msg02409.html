Dear Jon,

&gt; &gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There seems to be a question of what "reduction of a 
&gt; triadic relation
&gt; &gt; to dyadic relations" means to different people.  So using 
&gt; Jon's example
&gt; &gt; of an AND truth table, here is what I mean.  I mean that 
&gt; for any n-ary
&gt; &gt; relation I can create a set of at most n binary relations from which
&gt; &gt; the original n-ary relation can be created as a view.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't have skills in SQL but using Microsoft Access I was able
&gt; &gt; to construct the following tables and a view definition based on
&gt; &gt; them using the graphical tools of Access. The SQL presented below
&gt; &gt; is an output from this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here are the results:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Truth_Value_Table
&gt; &gt; o------------o
&gt; &gt; |Truth_Value |
&gt; &gt; o------------o
&gt; &gt; |False       |

&gt; &gt; AND_Truth_Table_Query (Query Definition)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; SELECT AND_Argument1.[Arg1-Value],
&gt; &gt;        AND_Argument2.[Arg2-Value],
&gt; &gt;        AND_Result.[Result-Value]
&gt; &gt; FROM
&gt; &gt;   (AND_Argument1
&gt; &gt;      INNER JOIN AND_Argument2
&gt; &gt;        ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Argument2.Row)
&gt; &gt;      INNER JOIN AND_Result
&gt; &gt;        ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Result.Row;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (Result of executing the query)
&gt; &gt; o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt; &gt; |Arg1-Value | Arg2-Value | Result-Value|
&gt; &gt; o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt; &gt; |True       | True       | True        |
&gt; &gt; |True       | False      | False       |
&gt; &gt; |False      | True       | False       |
&gt; &gt; |False      | False      | False       |
&gt; &gt; o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; From where I sit doing this is trivial technically.
&gt; &gt; And when I say that a triadic relation can be "reduced" to
&gt; &gt; a dyadic form, this (and not something else) is what I mean.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The question is, why and when might this be useful?
&gt; &gt; The answer is that many n-ary relations are overconstrained.
&gt; &gt; I.e. they are not a good model because there are many cases
&gt; &gt; they do not support.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is particularly so when activities are represented by 
&gt; relations.
&gt; &gt; Take giving as an example.  Using a relation to represent this does
&gt; &gt; not only require that there is a giver, a receiver, and a gift, but
&gt; &gt; it requires that there is not more than one giver, 
&gt; receiver, and gift.
&gt; &gt; Whilst it is true that there are some giving acts for which this
&gt; &gt; constraint holds, it is not true for all giving activities.
&gt; &gt; And whilst you could define relations for all the possible
&gt; &gt; combinations of different numbers of givers, receivers,
&gt; &gt; and gifts, this is not particularly practical.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So how does changing the representation of an activity from
&gt; &gt; a relation to a set and some binary relations help?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The answer is that it removes the constraints.
&gt; &gt; Actually it removes both the minimum constraints
&gt; &gt; and the maximum constraints.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Even removing the minimum constraint can be useful
&gt; &gt; from an epistemological viewpoint.  So whilst in
&gt; &gt; an act of giving ontologically we know that there
&gt; &gt; must be at least one giver, one given and one gift,
&gt; &gt; do we necessarily have knowledge of each of these
&gt; &gt; for any giving activity?  More particularly do we
&gt; &gt; always have to care?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Example:  Steve Redgrave was given his 5th gold medal in
&gt; &gt; rowing at the Sydney Olympics.  Do we care who gave it to him?
&gt; &gt; Would we wish to be prevented from recording anything about this
&gt; &gt; giving act if we could not identify the person who gave it to him?
&gt; &gt; I think not.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course there are times when you do want to require some 
&gt; information.
&gt; &gt; Explicit axioms can be used to support this.  For example, 
&gt; if you do not
&gt; &gt; have a product ordered and a customer at least, then there 
&gt; is no purpose
&gt; &gt; to accepting only partial information as an order.

&gt; | My comment was directed to the question of what you "syntacticians"
&gt; | intend by the various symbols that you introduce on the right side
&gt; | of this purported definition, equivalence, or whatchamacallit this
&gt; | very hour or minute.  You are a sensible person.  If you ask me to
&gt; | define or to explain some problematic concept or term that I foist

&gt; | immediately "smell a rat", as they say, and demand that I try once

&gt; | Thus, a person does not escape the charge of a circular definition

&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Virtual Reality (VR) is a lot of fun, can be very educational,
&gt; and is well-known to have a panoply of practical applications,
&gt; among which number a wealth of deadly serious industrial uses --
&gt; I have seen instructional software for the domain of physics
&gt; where one can play with frictionless pucks, bounce a six-ton
&gt; superball off an ideally inelastic concrete wall on a planet
&gt; with the gravity of Jupiter, all while keeping my own bipeds
&gt; solidly planted on "Terra Firma" (TF), where I can entertain
&gt; myself with life in a universe where entropy is conservative
&gt; and energy is liberal, been there, done that, and I can tell
&gt; you that it was a truly miraculous existence, a virtual trip,
&gt; if not quite literally a Veri-Table Experience -- but a line
&gt; divides a "Virtual Imaginary Experiential World" (VIEW) from
&gt; a "Virtually InExistent World" (VIEW), a line evidently cast
&gt; too finely in this thin air to be dreamt of in the images of
&gt; my acronymic philosophy.  But if the lesson that a person is
&gt; thereby instructed to draw from this bit of virtual exercise
&gt; is that the laws of physics and the laws of information are
&gt; somehow optional for the likes of me and thee, or that they
&gt; could indeed be disrespected by the very designatories who
&gt; designed these virtual environments, then that person has
&gt; another lesson coming.
&gt; 
&gt; But I am a sensible person, too -- no, really! -- at any rate,
&gt; when the currents of my rarefied air have a functional moment
&gt; of coordinate projection in exactly the right eigen-direction,
&gt; and so I must tell you that I smell something just a bit ripe,
&gt; indeed, more over-ripe, here, in this, your reputed reduction.
&gt; 
&gt; So I will ask you to climb down off your end-user's high-chair,
&gt; and to think for a while about what is really going on beneath
&gt; the glib and glossy surface of your Microsoft XS, and then, if
&gt; you honestly believe, and mean to claim, that no ANDimals were
&gt; used in the making of this filmy production, well, then we may
&gt; indeed be forced to proceed a bit further with the analysis of
&gt; your analysis, and all the categoriness of this meta-reduction.

MW: I see no "and"s, simply a number of tables with no more than
2 columns from which your world view can be derived through the
application of a relational operation.
