Dear Jon,

This is a good question. But I do nto recall, and cannot
find quickly the distinction between a ROSO and an ULTO.
Could you provide a definition/description please?

&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Problem Statement.
&gt; 
&gt; A.  What are the different types of ontology projects
&gt;     that are covered by our current scope and purpose?
&gt; 
&gt; B.  What are the criteria that are appropriate
&gt;     to each of the different ontology projects?
&gt; 
&gt; Given, then, that different types of ontology projects
&gt; will have different criteria for the acceptability and
&gt; the adequacy of proposals at each stage of development,
&gt; let us see if we can formulate the respective criteria
&gt; for a number of ontology projects that fall within the
&gt; charge, scope and purpose of a standard upper ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; A variety of ontology projects come to mind.
&gt; I will give them these working designations:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  ROSO
&gt; 
&gt;     What are the minimal criteria of acceptability of
&gt;     a &quot;research oriented scientific ontology&quot; (ROSO)?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  ULTO
&gt; 
&gt;     What are the minimal criteria of acceptability for
&gt;     an &quot;upper level technical ontology&quot; (ULTO)?
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  URFO
&gt; 
&gt;     What are the minimal criteria of acceptability for
&gt;     an &quot;un-reflective folk ontology&quot; (URFO)?
&gt; 
&gt; We've all concurred, or at least relented, that there's
&gt; room enough under the Standard Umbrella Ontology for the
&gt; type of &quot;un-reflective folk ontology&quot; (URFO) that concerns
&gt; itself mostly with &quot;shoes, ships, sealing wax&quot;, and so on,
&gt; but the question remains, on less rainy days, whether the
&gt; principles and the parameters that suit the garden variety
&gt; URFO are adaptable to the rigors of the ROSO and the ULTO.
&gt; 
&gt; After we have settled on the minimal criteria of acceptability,
&gt; we might then venture into establishing the ideal criteria of
&gt; adequacy for the respective types of ontologies.
&gt; 
&gt; Defining, or at least characterizing these types
&gt; of ontology projects would of course be a major
&gt; part of the task of developing the respective
&gt; criteria for acceptability and adequacy.

&gt; 
&gt; Notes on previous exchanges:
&gt; 
&gt; JA = Jon Awbrey
&gt; JH = Jay Halcomb
&gt; PG = Pierre Grenon
&gt; 
&gt; PG: Never the less, it seems to me that this group would be
&gt;     better off if proposed material was judged on criteria
&gt;     similar to those by which the final product shall be
&gt;     evaluated, rather than dependent upon pleasant
&gt;     email exchanges.
&gt; 
&gt; JH: I agree with this view, which was the essential point
&gt;     of my last e-mail -- getting more specific about such
&gt;     criteria for working documents.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: Many people, present writer included, have observed that 
&gt; the criteria
&gt;     appropriate to different kinds of ontology applications 
&gt; and projects,
&gt;     all of them nonetheless falling under the rather large tent of our
&gt;     scope and purpose document, may be radically different.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: In particular, I have pointed to the differences in 
&gt; working methodology
&gt;     and goals of research oriented ontologies and, for the 
&gt; lack of a better
&gt;     name, so-called commonsense ontologies.
&gt; 
&gt; JH: Precisely so.  I think that we've many of us said these similar
&gt;     things at one time or another, and we always return to them when
&gt;     a proposal is made (recall the discussion about the CycL language
&gt;     when that proposal was made).  That is why I think that developing
&gt;     clearer acceptance criteria, upfront, for specifying these various
&gt;     targets is important, when it comes to working documents for the
&gt;     group.  Specifically, developing  specification criteria for
&gt;     terminologies, languages, and logic(s).  I would  hope the
&gt;     IFF folks should have some specific thoughts about this.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: Until a better term comes along, I'm using the word &quot;project&quot;
&gt;     somewhat in the way that people speak of cultural projects or
&gt;     existential projects -- broad, compelling, if slightly vague
&gt;     intimations of something that needs to be done.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: Here is a narrative about one sort of ontology project,
&gt;     the aims, criteria, and working assumptions of which
&gt;     I am acquainted with, and feel like I understand:
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I once got sold on the project of building software 
&gt; bridges between
&gt;     qualitative and quantitative research.  For example, in many areas
&gt;     of clinical practice, medical anthropology, and public health one
&gt;     has &quot;practitioner-scientist models&quot; where people accumulate lots
&gt;     of free-floating informal hunches and qualitative impressions in
&gt;     their on-the-job settings, that they then need to follow up with
&gt;     hard data gathering, quantitatively measurable constructs, and
&gt;     the usual battery of statistical methods.  A lot of practical
&gt;     savvy never gets widely distributed, and a lot of benighted
&gt;     mythology never gets tested, all for the lack of good ways
&gt;     to refine this &quot;personal knowledge&quot; into scientific truth.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: It still seems to me that properly designed lexical and 
&gt; logical resources
&gt;     ought to provide us with some of the plancks we need to 
&gt; build this bridge.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: At first strike, it sounds like this ought to involve an 
&gt; integration of
&gt;     research oriented and common sense ontologies.  But there 
&gt; has seemed to
&gt;     arise one insurmountable obstacle after another in trying 
&gt; to do this.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: Just by way of focusing on a concrete illustration, take 
&gt; the word &quot;event&quot;.
&gt;     Formalizing the concept of &quot;event&quot; for a research 
&gt; oriented ontology does
&gt;     not require any discusssion on our part.  Those 
&gt; discussions were carried
&gt;     out somewhere between the days of 
&gt; powdered-wig-wearing-high-rollers and
&gt;     the days of manurial comparisons.  To get the standard 
&gt; axioms, one goes
&gt;     to a standard reference book and copies them into one's 
&gt; knowledge base:
&gt; 
&gt;     | PAS.  Probability And Statistics -- Ontology List

&gt;     | 02.  <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg04886.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg04886.html</A>

&gt;     | 04.  <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg04888.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg04888.html</A>
&gt;     |
&gt;     | et sic deinceps ...
&gt; 
&gt; JA: The only question is whether one's favorite ontology 
&gt; prover is up to
&gt;     the snuff of proving whatever theorems need to be proved thereon.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: There can be no compromise with these criteria.
&gt;     The research market simply will not bear it.
&gt;     So if there is to be an integration with
&gt;     nontechnical language and methodology,
&gt;     it must be an augmentation of these
&gt;     basics and not their overwriting.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I have gotten used to the idea that there is another sort 
&gt; of ontology project,
&gt;     but since I do not get the cogency of it, it seems like 
&gt; its definition and its
&gt;     criteria of validity would have to come from the critical 
&gt; self-examination of
&gt;     those whose project it is.  All I know at present is that 
&gt; the obvious course
&gt;     that I suggested above for formalizing the concept 
&gt; &quot;event&quot; is probably the
&gt;     course of last resort from the standpoint of this 
&gt; alternative project.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: That is what I mean by radical differences in working 
&gt; criteria for acceptance.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: Similar disjunctions of approach and acceptability could 
&gt; be observed
&gt;     for several other dimensions of diversity among 
&gt; ontological projects,
&gt;     for example, the &quot;already been chewed&quot; vs. the &quot;knowledge 
&gt; soup&quot; brands,
&gt;     that is, those who expect full-fledged axiom systems from 
&gt; the outset
&gt;     vs. those who would gel their knowledge chunks out of a 
&gt; semiotic sol.
