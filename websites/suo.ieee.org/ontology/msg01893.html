David Whitten &lt;whitten@lynx.eaze.net&gt; (To John Velman:)

&gt;I think you are talking about the ;; comments that appear axioms.
&gt;I agree that we need to put reference identifiers into discussion
&gt;documents.  What do you think of the method I used in
&gt;<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01016.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01016.html</A> ?
&gt;ie:
&gt;R001:
&gt;(forall (?ANY)
&gt;    (= ?ANY ?ANY))

Right now there is no provision in KIF syntax for attaching comments 
to anything. I have made a proposal to the KIF working group for a 
simple extension to the KIF syntax which will allow something similar 
to the above. We will almost certainly come up with some method soon.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  Time.  I understand that, at this level, this ontology is supposed to
&gt; &gt; be time neutral (3d 4d).  Some people may have a problem with 
&gt;this;  on the other
&gt; &gt; hand, I agree with the approach of keeping things time and space neutral at
&gt; &gt; this level.  But it is hard to think this way.
&gt;
&gt;I think it would be impossible to to be time-neutral.

Of course KIF is time-neutral. Chris' ontology does not mention time 
or anything that is time-relative.

&gt;It does make sense to talk about axioms that exist for all-time, (ie:
&gt;eternal, unchanging) or axioms that don't mention time.

Logical axioms do not exist in or out of time. The things the axioms 
describe might be temporally located, but Chris' axioms, to repeat, 
are not about anything that is temporally located (or spatially or 
causally located, among many other things.)

&gt; I'm just convinced
&gt;that time is something that you can't be agnostic/neutral about.

Then Im afraid you are wrong. For example, arithmetic is 
agnostic/neutral about time: it has nothing to do with time.
Time is just one of the many topics that an ontology might be about. 
Not all ontologies need to be concerned with it.

&gt;There is an interaction with time whether you like it or not.
&gt;At best we define 'base assumptions' that specify a default for what that
&gt;interaction will bee with our axioms.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. Some confusion results from the order in which things are presented, and
&gt; &gt; lack of clear statements as to what is primative.   Some things that are
&gt; &gt; stated as axioms or theorems seem to either be or need definitions.

These distinctions (between primitive/nonprimitive, and between 
definitions and axioms) have no logical content. All concepts are 
'primitive'.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps they are there but I haven't found them.  The theorem on unions of
&gt; &gt; classes struck me as lacking a definition of union -- but I found it
&gt; &gt; later on.   I'm still looking for the definition of 'empty.'

There are no definitions, strictly speaking. There are biconditionals 
statements that can be thought of as definitions informally, but that 
way of thinking has no logical or semantic content.

&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;  -- I've thrown in the term 'particular' since particulars seem to be
&gt; &gt; ;;  lurking
&gt; &gt; ;;  in the background.  I'm not sure this is essential at this stage, but
&gt; &gt; ;;  I'm more comfortable including them.

I'm more comfortable excluding them, until someone axiomatises the 
notion. Part of the background thinking behind the revised KIF is 
that there are no fundamental  semantic distinctions between classes 
and individuals, or between relations and the things they relate, and 
so on. Everything is an individual, and everything has an extension.

&gt;Just as long as you realize that some of us have no idea what a particular
&gt;might be. (I personally think that they are similar to instances of a class)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;  Well formed expressions --
&gt; &gt; ;;  We need to know that if (relation ?rel) then (?rel @args) is well
&gt; &gt; ;; formed if and only if @args has one or more entries.

That is not the case in this version of KIF.  Every instance of (?rel 
@args) is well-formed, including (R) (where 'R' instantiates ?rel and 
the empty row instantiates @args). Being well-formed and being true 
are not the same thing, of course.

If you want to restrict yourself to the case where there must be at 
least one argument, write (?rel ?arg1 @args)

&gt;I don't know how
&gt; &gt; ;; to do this, so having noted it, I'm going to gloss over it.
&gt;
&gt;I included axioms in my structural ontology specifically to define
&gt;what well-formed means. The naive approach of simply stating
&gt;(=&gt; (relation ?rel) (?rel ?arg))  (for the unary case) has the
&gt;disadvantage that it could be interpreted as saying that all relations
&gt;must have at least one extension.

That is true.  Everything has precisely one extension in any interpretation.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (documentation "Axiom: only relations can be truly predicated of other
&gt; &gt; things")
&gt; &gt; (forall (?r @args)
&gt; &gt;      (=&gt; (?r @args)
&gt; &gt;          (relation  ?r)))
&gt;
&gt;What does it mean for a relation to be falsely predicated of other things?

It means that when it is predicated of those things, it is false. Or 
equivalently, that those things are not in its extension.

&gt;Also, as I read this, it says that if you have an extension you must have
&gt;the first element satisfying the unary-relation 'relation'.  Is that what
&gt;you meant to say?

No, that is not a correct reading of the axiom. It says that if an expression
(?r @args) is true, then ?r must denote a relation. Which makes 
sense, since the only way that the first expression can be true is if 
the extension of the denotation of ?r must contain an n-tuple of 
elements; and only extensions of relations will contain any n-tuples 
at all.

&gt;You do recall that you can have a function whose result is a relation, right?

Sure. So the variable '?r' might be bound to a term like '(f AB)' as 
well as to a simple relation name. That is fine: the conclusion would 
be: (relation (f AB)).
.....

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Nothing is both a relation and a particular")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (forall (?x) (not
&gt; &gt;                (and (relation ?x)  (particular ?x))))

Well, you are free to write any axioms you want, but I see no good 
reason for making this distinction. What utility is there in 
insisting that relations cannot be particulars?

&gt; &gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; &gt; ;;  It is unclear to me why unary and binary were given as AXIOMS rather
&gt; &gt; ;;  than as DEFINITIONS.   It seems to me they should be defined.
&gt; &gt; ;;  Alternatively, one makes these primative terms, and then gives AXIOMS.
&gt; &gt; ;;  BUt why not just define them?
&gt;
&gt;Other than the fact that KIF has no way of stating a mathematical/logical
&gt;definition ?  (it only defines terms, axioms and rules between them.)

Actually it doesnt DEFINE anything at all. It uses a vocabulary and 
makes assertions about it, and provides a semantics for the language 
the assertions are written in. (It doesn't define inference rules 
either; any inference rules that preserve truth according the 
semantics will do.)

&gt; &gt; ;;  In either case, at this point in the development we can
&gt; &gt; ;;  go from here to a definiton (or axiomatization?) of arity of relations,
&gt; &gt; ;;  and the other definitions and theorems in the section on BASIC RELATION
&gt; &gt; ;;  THEORY  (except, of course, those that refer to classes).
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;   I think the following are axioms:
&gt; &gt; (documentation "AXIOM  relation is a unary relation")
&gt; &gt; (unary relation)
&gt; &gt;
&gt;I agree.

Yes, but there is no need to say that, since it follows from other 
assertions in the ontology.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; (documentation "AXIOM  particular is a unary relation")
&gt; &gt; (unary particular)
&gt;
&gt;Maybe, but I don't know what you mean by particular.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; (documentation "AXIOM instance-of is a binary relation")
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;   Assuming that has been done:
&gt; &gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (documentation "DEFINITION:  empty.  A relation is empty if it has no
&gt; &gt; instances")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
&gt; &gt;      (&lt;=&gt; (empty ?rel)
&gt; &gt;           (not (exists (@args) (?rel @args)))))
&gt; &gt;
&gt;What is the difference between a relation being empty and a relation having
&gt;no extension, and a relation having an extension that is empty?

Everything has an extension. If the extension is a set of n-tuples, 
it is a relation. That includes the empty set. There is a difference 
between having an extension that is not a set, and having an 
extension which is the empty set.

&gt; &gt; (documentation "DEFINITION:  A class is a unary relation")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
&gt; &gt;      (&lt;=&gt; (class ?rel) (unary ?rel) ) )
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure about this.
&gt;However, I expect that even when all relations that are unary are also
&gt;classes, that the fact that they may have different extensions won't make
&gt;'unary' a synonym for 'class'.

I'm not sure what you mean. They won't have different extensions. 
Whatever ?rel denotes, it will be an individual thing, and that thing 
will have a unique extension. If it is a relation, the extension will 
be a set of n-tuples; and all the axiom says is that if they are all 
1-tuples, then that set is a class.
