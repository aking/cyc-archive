&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;	Thanks for your comments.  See my responses below.

OK, thanks, and mostly I'd just say, fair enough. Few comments later:

&gt; &gt; Well, this is where I start to worry, since this is an area where we
&gt; &gt; have found very complex and tricky relationships between alternative
&gt; &gt; formulations. For example, if one theory uses an 'adjacency'
&gt; &gt; relationship but another defines adjacent as sharing a common
&gt; &gt; boundary, then the two theories are likely to be incommensurate, in
&gt; &gt; that they are quantifying over different universes, so the
&gt; &gt; translation between them becomes very complicated to state. Its not
&gt; &gt; impossible, let me emphasise, just *difficult* to get right; the
&gt; &gt; axioms of one have to be rewritten in a completely different form to
&gt; &gt; make them compatible with the other.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;OK, point noted.  But it seems to me that these hypothetical
&gt;incommensurabilities can be addressed on a case-by-case basis as they are
&gt;realized and noted.

Perhaps, but this is rather like saying that bugs can be fixed when 
they arise, as an argument against software engineering. The point is 
that the work is likely to increase exponentially.

&gt; I can't think of some sort of reasonable policy that
&gt;would prevent these sorts of incompatibilities from creeping in, as long as
&gt;the strategy is one of merging/aligning the various extant high-level
&gt;conceptual schemas.  I know you have objections to this general strategy,
&gt;but I don't think you have proposed an alternative.

Well, I don't know if this is an alternative, but I think it might be 
worth trying to document, if only informally in English comments, 
what the basic 'universal' assumptions are of the various component 
ontologies, so that when changes are made (eg as I hope they will be 
to the continuant/occurrent split), one has a reasonable hope of 
being able to re-align the quantifiers into the changed structure; 
and also, for example, if the sub-ontology in fact is based on a more 
general notion than is available in the current high-level 
classification, then one can maybe 'rescue' it in the future.

Heres a slogan: any time someone puts together a theory of something, 
they have in mind a range for their quantifiers. A vital part of an 
adequate docuemntation for any such (sub-)ontology is a careful 
statement of what its intended universe of quantification is supposed 
to be. Examples of such 'intended universes' include for example for 
spatial ontologies: regular subsets of any topological space; 
connected subsets of mereological space; arbitrary subsets of 
mereological space; all geographical regions including boundaries; 
connected four-dimensional regions of spacetime; bounded regions of 
3-space; locations occupied by a physical entity; locations defined 
relative to a a physical entity (all real examples, all mutually 
incompatible); for 'object' ontologies: solid physical objects, 
connected collections of physical objects, mereological sums of 
matter in a spatial or spatiotemporal region; anything with a 
physical dimension, including places; anything that can be enclosed 
in a convex hull; anything that can be indicated by an English noun 
phrase (all real examples, etc.. In fact one can take all of these 
and multiply them by about three or four, since any of them can be 
fitted against time in several alternative ways); for temporal 
ontologies: timepoints; connected intervals on the 
real/rational/integer lines; branching intervals; finite sets of 
connected intervals; intervals in an order structure; points and 
intervals; points, intervals and durations; numerical clock times; 
anything that endures (all real examples, etc.). And so on; I'm sure 
you get the idea.  Notice that just to say something like 'this is a 
theory about times' really isnt enough; one needs to know something 
like how the (composer of the) theory *views* times.  Just about 
every process ontology on the market, for example, is based on a 
somewhat different view of what counts as a process.

Your current methodology takes the upper level as 'fixed' 
(modifiable, but at every stage it is the skeleton) and fits lower 
levels into it, which I think is likely to be the wrong way around at 
this stage; I would rather see a collection of 'useful' mid-level 
ontologies first, and then an organized attempt to design a coherent 
upper level into which they could be fitted. This can be done 
semi-automatically, and might well locate the 'natural' upper-level 
categories much more usefully than trying to decide what the top-most 
divisions have to be on a priori grounds. For example, take the 
'parts' ontology. Is this really about pieces of solid stuff, or 
pieces of space, or pieces of space-time? In fact it could be about 
any of these and would work fine, but it can't simultaneously be 
about them all. Unfortunately I really, sincerely, honestly have 
absolutely no idea what a 'corpuscular object' is, and so your saying 
it is about those is worse than saying nothing. I'd rather have it 
left open so that we could decide later. Knowing it is about 
'corpuscular objects' just gives me a kind of ontological paralysis. 
I'm not free to interpret it as I want, but I have no idea how to 
interpret it. Its like being given instructions which say: Warning! 
Use only as directed!,  and then with the rest in a foreign language.

There is a related issue. I have been reading the upper ontology as 
being essentially a tree (actually a DAG). But Sowa is one of those 
who has consistently (and I think correctly) urged that this is NOT 
the best way to think of the upper ontology, and in Heidelberg we 
decided, largely at John's urging, to deliberately not think in 
tree-classification (ie class/subclass) terms, but instead to try to 
locate 'aspects' which were as far as possible orthogonal to one 
another and could be used as generators of a lattice. Formal details 
can be found on Sowa's website, in fact. Has this (to my mind, much 
more useful) approach been abandoned?

I agree with your next point entirely:

&gt; Note too that an
&gt;alternative is not something like:  "Let's try to get the 'foundations'
&gt;right before we go any further".  Western philosophy has been working on the
&gt;foundations for 2,500 years now, and we're still anxiously awaiting the
&gt;moment when two philosophers agree on any epistemological or metaphysical
&gt;point.  We don't have time to wait around for another 2,500 years, and we
&gt;need to constantly bear in mind (I would argue) that the goal is to produce
&gt;an engineering artifact, not to get straight about the nature of the
&gt;universe.

Please don't misunderstand me. I don't want to get the nature of the 
universe sorted out. What I do think however is that we need to 
document what the various views on the nature of parts of the 
universe actually are, because it really is asking too much to expect 
everyone's axioms to reflect a single common view. And I am concerned 
about having to conform to some global view on the nature of the 
universe which I know already isnt going to work.
