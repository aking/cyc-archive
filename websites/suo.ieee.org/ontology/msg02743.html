Ian, Pat C., et al.,

Some comments:

IN&gt;&gt; Entity
&gt;&gt;         Physical
&gt;&gt;                 Object
&gt;&gt;                 Process
&gt;&gt;         Relation
&gt;&gt;         Abstract
&gt;&gt;                 Set
&gt;&gt;                 Proposition
&gt;&gt;                 Quantity
&gt;&gt;                 Attribute

Why do you have a 3-way split of Physical, Relation, &amp; Abstract?

Another question:  Why do you have an object/process distinction
under Physical and no parallel distinction under Abstract?
The parallel distinction that I put under abstract is the
Schema/Procedure distinction.  Those are the abstract descriptions
of objects and processes respectively.

Third question:  Why do you have set, quantity, proposition,
and attribute at the same level?  There is a great deal of
analysis that has to be done to distinguish them.  And most of
that analysis belongs to the general field of "formal semiotic",
which also includes logic as a subset.

I would suggest a two-way split of Physical &amp; Abstract, with
physical relationships under physical and abstract relation
types under Abstract.

PC&gt;I have mentioned previously that the creation of an "abstract"
&gt;category
&gt;as disjoint from "physical" at the highest level is in my view
&gt;unnecessry 
&gt;and highly undesirable, since it would preclude, for example, the
&gt;creation 
&gt;of a general concept "object" which subsumes both physical objects and 
&gt;abstract objects.

First of all, there is a general type Entity, which subsumes
both physical and abstract.  Second, I would place the
Physical/Abstract distinction on the same level as many other
top-level distinctions.  There is no reason why Physical/Abstract
should be considered more fundamental than several other
distinctions that might be placed at the top level.

PC&gt;There are other problems, such as if one wants to
&gt;define
&gt;a space or time as a set (or at least as a collection), it would be
&gt;impossible 

Space and time are not sets or collections.  Sets and
collections are representations.  Nothing physical can be
a representation, although it might be used to record a sign
of some representation (as a pencil mark may be used to
make signs that represent sets or collections or numbers).

&gt;in the above classification to consider either as a "physical" concept,
&gt;even 
&gt;though space-time is as physical as my hand, as I understand current
&gt;theories
&gt;of cosmology.  One tactic is used by CYC, for example, where the concept
&gt;of
&gt;"set or collection" is at a very high level, allowing one to treat
&gt;groups of
&gt;physical objects to some extent like sets, but also allowing purely 
&gt;mathematical sets to be defined.

That is one reason why Lenat says that the upper level of
the Cyc ontology is not very important.  It is so totally
screwed up that there are no useful inferences that can be
derived from it.

PC&gt;The main motivating factor in my concern about a high-level
&gt;abstract/concrete
&gt;distinction is that this would nullify the common and very useful
&gt;process of 
&gt;creating more general ("abstract") concepts by removing spcific
&gt;attributes
&gt;or specific defining axioms from lower-level concepts.  It should be
&gt;possible
&gt;to remove the physical attributes from physical objects and processes to
&gt;get
&gt;more general concepts that are not physical, but are ancestors to the
&gt;physical concepts.

A general physical concept can only become abstract by removing
all physicality from it.  Generality and Abstraction are totally
orthogonal distinctions.

PC&gt;An outline of an alternative top few levels could be, just for
&gt;illustation
&gt;(concepts with a preceding ** have multiple inheritance in this short
&gt;classification):
&gt;
&gt; Entity
&gt;    Object
&gt;       Physical Object
&gt;           Ordinary Matter
&gt;               Solid Object
&gt;                   Rigid Object

&gt;               Purposive Agent

&gt;                   Plant

&gt;                   **Mammal
&gt;                       **Human being
&gt;    Relation
&gt;        Function
&gt;            Process
&gt;                Physical Process
&gt;                    Mental Process
&gt;                        Communication
&gt;                Mathematical Process
&gt;            **Mathematical function
&gt;        Semantic Relation
&gt;    Property (=attribute)
&gt;        Location
&gt;    Set or Collection
&gt;        **Mathematical Set
&gt;        Physical collection
&gt;            **Powder
&gt;        Dimension
&gt;           Physical Space Dimension
&gt;           Time
&gt;        Space
&gt;            Abstract space
&gt;            Physical space-time
&gt;    State
&gt;        Physical State

No.  There is too much here to criticize.  It would be better
if you suggested your distinctions one at a time, since every
one of them deserves a distinct thread that could take several
hundred e-mails to discuss.

PC&gt;Much of importance has been left out, and there are other concepts
&gt;in most of these categories that have been left out, this is 
&gt;just presented as an illustration of why high-level "abstract" is
&gt;unnecessarily constraining.  It is particularly a problem where
&gt;we hope that the SUO will be useful as a common basis for as many
&gt;lower-level ontologies as can fit into any one "ontological commitment".
&gt;The illustrative hierarchy here is not the only one that could be
&gt;created without an abstract/physical dichotomy, and many others might
&gt;be justs as useful or more useful.

No, I don't think so.

&gt;The justification of these choices and axiomatization to reflect 
&gt;the meaningful relations will require more time than I can provide in
&gt;the immediate future, but I believe that this classification is 
&gt;consistent and will be more useful than one with a highest-level
&gt;abstract/physical dichotomy.

As I said before, the abstract/physical dichotomy is only one
of many distinctions that could be applied at the top level.
