Modeling SIG,

I am going to pick up on the following exchange:

JC: It's a dumb system, but if math (or logic)
    is just a meaningless formalism, then I
    don't see a good reason to exclude it.

JA: We have already agreed that it's meaningful.
    We are just haggling over the denominations
    of senses that it might most sensibly have.

From where I sit, in my task as taste tester,
it's &quot;yet another mathematical system&quot; (YAMS),
whose proof lies in the baking, the candying,
and the eating thereof.  In other words, YAMS
is cultivated within a cultural and a natural
context, being a trick that evolution fancies
might be an adaptation well-bred into us, and
YAMS will be evaluated on those exact grounds.

The issue at stake here echoes a claim that Hertz
makes in his formulation of the modeling relation,
where he says:

| For our purpose it is not necessary that they [the images] should be
| in conformity with the [external] things in any other respect whatever.
| As a matter of fact, we do not know, nor have we any means of knowing,
| whether our conception of things [our models] are in conformity with
| them [external things] in any other than this one fundamental respect.

This is the piece of his formulation where I see vague but persistent signs
of trouble ahead if we just blindly accept it and go on blithely from there.
It reminds me too much of the excathedra bulls that Ludovico Wittgenstein
issued against Russell's early effort to understand the fixing of belief.

Here is a sample of Russell's essay:

| 'How shall we describe the logical form of a belief?'
|
| I want to try to get an account of the way that a belief is made up.
| That is not an easy question at all.  You cannot make what I should call
| a map-in-space of a belief.  You can make a map of an atomic fact but not of
| a belief, for the simple reason that space-relations always are of the atomic
| sort or complications of the atomic sort.  I will try to illustrate what I mean.
| The point is in connexion with there being two verbs in the judgment and with the
| fact that both verbs have got to occur as verbs, because if thing is a verb it
| cannot occur otherwise than as a verb.  Suppose I take &quot;A believes that B loves C&quot;.
| &quot;Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio.&quot;  There you have a false belief.
| You have this odd state of affairs that the verb &quot;loves&quot; occurs in that proposition
| and seems to occur as relating Desdemona to Cassio whereas in fact it does not do so,
| but yet it does occur as a verb, it does occur in the sort of way that a verb should do.
| I mean that when A believes that B loves C, you have to have a verb in the place where
| &quot;loves&quot; occurs.  You cannot put a substantive in its place.  Therefore it is clear that
| the subordinate verb (i.e., the verb other that believing) is functioning as a verb, and
| seems to be relating two terms, but as a matter of fact does not when a judgment happens
| to be false.  That is what constitutes the puzzle about the nature of belief.  You will
| notice that whenever one gets to really close quarters with the theory of error one has
| the puzzle of how to deal with error without assuming the existence of the non-existent.
| I mean that every theory of error sooner or later wrecks itself by assuming the existence
| of the non-existent.  As when I say &quot;Desdemona loves Cassio&quot;, it seems as if you have
| a non-existent love between Desdemona and Cassio, but that is just as wrong as a
| non-existent unicorn.  So you have to explain the whole theory of judgment in
| some other way.  I come now to this question of a map.  Suppose you try such
| a map as this:
|
|                                    Othello
|                                       |
|                                       |
|                                   beli|eves
|                                       |
|                                       v
|                        Desdemona -----------&gt; Cassio
|                                     loves
|
| The question of making a map is not so strange as you might suppose because it is
| part of the whole theory of symbolism.  It is important to realize where and how
| a symbolism of that sort would be wrong:  where and how it is wrong is that in
| the symbol you have this relationship relating these two things and in the fact
| it doesn't really relate them.  You cannot get in space any occurrence which is
| logically of the same form as belief.  When I say &quot;logically of the same form&quot;
| I mean that one can be obtained from the other by replacing the constituents
| of the one by the new terms.  If I say &quot;Desdemona loves Cassio&quot; that is of
| the same form as &quot;A is to the right of B&quot;.  Those are of the same form,
| and I say that nothing that occurs in space is of the same form as
| belief.  I have got on here to a new sort of thing, a new beast
| for our zoo, not another member of our former species but a new
| species.  The discovery of this fact is due to Mr. Wittgenstein.
|
| BR, POLA, pages 224-226.

| Bertrand Russell,
|&quot;The Philosophy of Logical Atomism&quot;, pages 177-281 in:
|'Logic and Knowledge:  Essays, 1901-1950',
| edited by Robert Charles Marsh,
| Routledge, London, UK, 1956.

Here are Wittgensteins's counters:

| A proper theory of judgment must make it impossible to judge nonsense.
|
| Ludwig Witgenstein, 'Notebooks, 1914-1916',
| Edited by G.H. von Wright &amp; G.E.M. Anscombe,
| With English translation by G.E.M. Anscombe,
| Harper &amp; Row, New York, NY, 1969.  Page 97.

| The correct explanation of the form of the proposition &quot;A judges p&quot; must
| show that it is impossible to judge a nonsense.  (Russell's theory does
| not satisfy this condition.)
|
| Ludwig Wittgenstein, 'Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus',
| Routledge, London, UK, 1922.  Paragraph 5.5422.

Now, the thing that HH's and LW's confessions of inadeqaucy have in common is this:
these are the views of an observer who is the captive of a single picture, that is,
to vary the image, who is standing too close to the screen of the given projection.
One of the whole points of working within a 3-dimensional sign relational frame is
precisely so that we do not permit ourselves to be trapped and victimized by icons,
idols, images, pictures, schemes, symbols that &quot;we form for ourselves&quot; in this way.

| We form for ourselves images or symbols of external objects;
| and the form which we give them is such that the logically
| necessary (denknotwendigen) consequents of the images in
| thought are always the images of the necessary natural
| (naturnotwendigen) consequents of the thing pictured.
|
| For our purpose it is not necessary that they [the images] should be
| in conformity with the [external] things in any other respect whatever.
| As a matter of fact, we do not know, nor have we any means of knowing,
| whether our conception of things [our models] are in conformity with
| them [external things] in any other than this one fundamental respect.
