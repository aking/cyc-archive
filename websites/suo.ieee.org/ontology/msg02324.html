Matthew,

It has begun to occur to me over the last few days that
the difference between our prespectives -- "prespective"?
hmm, that was a genuine typo, but prehaps it will turn out
to have a meaning that is telling in the present application --
arises more than anything else from divergent ways of seeing
the use of "formal or logical or mathematical" (FOLOM) models.
I am going to think about this a little more and maybe try to
write out a separate comment about it, but it takes us back to
a couple of pictures that we have seen here before, to a whole
array of issues that I myself have been thinking about for quite
some time, and over all to a problematic that is rather ancient --
Immanuel Kant's use of what he called "schemata" as intermediate
representations between realities and the mind is the first thing
that comes to mind, but I am sure that the topic goes back further
than that -- anyway, here are links to a few of the occasions that
I can find on which we broached this subject locally and recently:

As I tried to follow this thread, it turned out to be
a lot more tangled than I thought, going in, it would be.
Since the fine old philosophical concept of "reification"
seems to be yet another one of those ideas that will soon
be rendered meaningless by the cargo cultists of the world,
if not by the flushed enthusiasts of the WW-WC, if you catch
my drift, I have tossed in a number of classical references
to the vast and now distant ocean of good sense, of which
our own humankind was long ago the master on this score,
to wit, the associated ideas of abstraction and analogy
that go into our once-evolved crafts of hypostasis and
modeling, in other words, reification and simulation,
as I knew them, once, to be in their glory days --
alas! those days are now gone and quite forgotten.
But I nostalgicize ...

More specific remarks interspersed below,

&gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; I've read ahead a number of messages,
&gt; and this is a summary of where I am
&gt; at present.
&gt; 
&gt; In what you say below it seems that you are using
&gt; a different definition of what a relation and tuple
&gt; is to me (at least).

I have been suspecting this for quite some time now, but
you have insisted on repeating the standard definition of
a relation as a set of tuples, even though you rarely ever
use this defintion when it comes down to cases.

&gt; To you it seems that any construct ...

I think that we may have to pause at this point and discuss
what is meant by "construct", no doubt as used within various
dialects, and if we fail to find a common meaning then we may
need to look for a way to disptch the word without portfolio.

&gt; To you it seems that any construct
&gt; that has to involve at least three
&gt; things to be valid is necessarily
&gt; a 3-adic relation.

I try to take you at your word, but I honestly never know for sure
when you are using the word "relation" to mean "relation" and when
you are using the word "relation" to mean "relation instance", as
seems to be required to make sense of what you go on to predicate.

If I try to read this straightforwardly,
I must amend it to read a bit like this:

| To you it seems that any construct
| that has to involve at least three
| things to be valid is necessarily
| [a (&gt;= 3)-adic relation instance].

Can you clarify for me what you mean in this instance?

In order to continue without going totally bats,
I will have to substitute in your text below,
in square brackets, the changes that I need
to make sense of what you say.  Please let
me know if these are not agreeable to you.

&gt; The problem with this is that a 3-adic relation [instance]
&gt; requires EXACTLY 3 components, not at least 3 components,
&gt; and that these three components are necessary for identity.

I do not know what the last clause, about identity, means here.

&gt; Relatively few things [relation instances?] in real life meet
&gt; the criterion of exactly 3 components, and though I agree that
&gt; the example you have used of logical operators is one of them,
&gt; activities [activity instances?] generally are not.

You must try to remember whose team you are on --
it is not my fault that you keep throwing me all
of these interceptions!  My team is the one that
keeps on saying that there are things in reality,
the activities of communicating, giving, learning,
and thinking, just to name a few, whose inherent
complexities -- the full measure of which no doubt
goes beyond our meagre mortal abilities to render
effable, effectively describabel, f-able, or even
formalizable at all -- are such that they require
relational models whose arity is at least three
in order to represent them with anything like
the requisite adequacy.  Your team is the one
that keeps on saying that it just ain't so,
that anything that can be talked to death
can be talked to death, without loss of
adequate descriptive power, solely in
the reduced medium of 2-adic relations.
Every now and then, you appear to want
to switch sides, and yet without having
your move be counted a foul of the game
in play, as if to say that references to
realities more complex than 3-adic should
count on the side of 2-adic reductionists.
I do not understand this sort of thinking.

&gt; However, even with logical operators it is possible
&gt; to represent these without using 3-adic relations, ...

No, it is not.

&gt; although I agree that this does not remove
&gt; the three-ness of what is represented.

???

&gt; I have demonstrated this.

No, you have not.

&gt; You claim (elsewhere) that I have only presented tuples,
&gt; but in fact I have presented fully enumerated relations.

And by this "enumerated" to say that you changed the subject from
a 3-adic relation to a 4-adic relation.  "Changing the subject"
appears to be the solecism of choice in regard to this matter.

&gt; Finally, there is still the issue of your claim that things
&gt; can be reduced to triads.  You have however singularly failed
&gt; to provide the solution to this for the measurement example I
&gt; presented for those who think this can always be done without
&gt; violating the constraints that you wish to impose on others as
&gt; to what adacity is.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to write two brief papers:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  The transformation of a ternary relation into
&gt;     some set of binary relations (and vice versa)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  The use of relations to represent the world about us,
&gt;     practice and limitations.
&gt; 
&gt; These should at least put in one place where I stand currently.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt;    Matthew

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, I think what you *really* want is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the purely generalized form of this axiom,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of which the above is just an instance:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (forall (?x ?y ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (gives ?x ?y ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;              (exists (?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                   (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (giver ?e' ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (receiver ?e' ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (given ?e' ?z))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                       (= ?e ?e')))))))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I think we're getting there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But even more is needed after the "&lt;=&gt;" to assure that:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The same giving does not have more than one giver.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The same giving does not have more than one given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) The same giving does not have more than one receiver.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  This actually gets to the heart of the issue quite nicely,
&gt; &gt; &gt;      and provides one of the reasons I am unhappy with more
&gt; &gt; &gt;      than binary relations.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  You are right that the ternary relation does not
&gt; &gt; &gt;      only say that a giving relation involves at least
&gt; &gt; &gt;      a giver a receiver and a gift, but that it involves
&gt; &gt; &gt;      exactly one giver, receiver, and gift.  I think others
&gt; &gt; &gt;      have pointed out that this is not necessarily the case
&gt; &gt; &gt;      for all givings.  There may be many givers, many receivers
&gt; &gt; &gt;      or many gifts.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  This is what has driven us away from triadic or higher
&gt; &gt; &gt;      relations, rather than anything else.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  So I will now argue that the form that we have
&gt; &gt; &gt;      ended up with for giving is actually a more
&gt; &gt; &gt;      acurate reflection of reality.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I'm not quite up to writing what I want in KIF,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  with certainty.  Perhaps someone will step in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  and add the gory detail.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The &lt;=&gt; axiom above is invalid and probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    could be used to prove a contradiction.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) An augmented &lt;=&gt; axiom like the one above but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    disallowing two receivers, etc., might not lead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     to contradictions and a generalization of it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     might be OK in the SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) I certainly would not personally want to call
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    the change from what precedes the &lt;=&gt; to what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    follows the &lt;=&gt; a "reduction".
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Indeed, the only thing that is reduced is the arity
&gt; &gt;        of the relations used.  On the other hand we do have
&gt; &gt;        a more accurate model.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;                   ^^^
&gt; &gt; False statement.  |||
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Because I still believe that you really want to know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Exercise for the reader:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is the arity of the first "and" relation
&gt; &gt; that is invoked in the above bit of kiffage?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hint:  It has 5 arguments, and therefore represents
&gt; &gt;        a map 'And&lt;5&gt;' such that 'And&lt;5&gt;' : B^5 -&gt; B.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The use of a single symbol, in the way that "and" is used above,
&gt; &gt; to denote a series of operations 'And&lt;j&gt;', for j = 1, 2, 3, ...,
&gt; &gt; tantamount to an indefinite degree of equivocation, constitutes
&gt; &gt; what is commonly known as a "multigrade operator".  They can be
&gt; &gt; very convenient bits of syntactic sugar, but they do not alter
&gt; &gt; the underlying logical complexity of the operations invoked.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is, of course, aside from the fact that the relation "giving"
&gt; &gt; is at least as complex as a 3-adic relation, since its argument is
&gt; &gt; at least a 3-tuple -- and you can tell that it's at least a 3-tuple
&gt; &gt; from the fact that it has at least 3 components.  That's all that
&gt; &gt; a 3-tuple is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The basic principle here is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | If it looks like a k-tuple,
&gt; &gt; | if it talks like a k-tuple,
&gt; &gt; | if it walks like a k-tuple,
&gt; &gt; | then abduce it's a k-tuple.
