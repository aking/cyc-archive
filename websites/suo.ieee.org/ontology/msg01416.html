NEW ARTICLES

Joslyn, Cliff (2001): "The Semiotics of Control and Modeling 
Relations in Complex Systems", Prepared for a special issue of 
Biosystems, a festschrift for Howard Pattee.

<A  HREF="ftp://wwwc3.lanl.gov/pub/users/joslyn/biosystems.pdf">ftp://wwwc3.lanl.gov/pub/users/joslyn/biosystems.pdf</A>

Howard Pattee's concept of semantic or semiotic closure has been 
foundational for a school of theoretical biology derived from systems 
theory and cybernetics. This paper proposes a conceptual analysis of 
some of the ideas and principles from systems theory which underlie 
semiotic closure, and which are fundamental to the philosophy of 
Principia Cybernetica. In particular, atomic control systems and 
models are described as the canonical forms of semiotic systems in 
relation to their environments. While they share measurement 
relations, they differ topologically in that control systems are 
circularly and models linearly related related to their environments.


Heylighen F. &amp; Joslyn C. (2001): "Cybernetics and Second Order 
Cybernetics", in: R.A. Meyers (ed.), Encyclopedia of Physical Science 
&amp; Technology (3rd ed.), (Academic Press, New York). [in press]

<A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Cybernetics-EPST.pdf">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Cybernetics-EPST.pdf</A>

Although it is obviously very difficult to summarize all the main 
ideas of cybernetics in a single paper without remaining very 
superficial, we believe we have managed to do a quite decent job of 
it, especially since several colleagues told us they would recommend 
it to their students. The paper provides an introduction to and 
overview of the main concepts (e.g. variety, feedback, closure, 
control, constructivism, ...) and principles (e.g. law of requisite 
variety, requisite hierarchy, self-organization, ...) of cybernetics. 
Where possible, the ideas have been made explicit using simple 
formulas and diagrams.


ANOTHER ACCOLADE FOR PCP WEB

The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), a long standing 
organization publishing such prestigious volumes as the Science 
Citation Index and Current Contents, has selected PCP web for 
inclusion in its new Current Web Contents:

"You are publishing important, high-quality material on the Web. For 
this reason, ISI has selected your site 
<A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/DEFAULT.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/DEFAULT.html</A> for inclusion in Current Web

a new section of Current Contents Connect TM.

CC Connect 
(<A  HREF="http://www.isinet.com/isi/products/cc/ccconnect/cccind.html">http://www.isinet.com/isi/products/cc/ccconnect/cccind.html</A>) offers 
Web access to Current Contents, the ISI premier current awareness 
database that provides information in the fields of science, social 
science, technology, and the arts &amp; humanities.  For more than 40 
years, ISI has delivered this multidisciplinary table-of-contents 
database to researchers, scientists and information professionals 
around the world.  Since its inception, this journal-based resource 
has reflected the strict guidelines for selection developed by the 
ISI Editorial Development Staff.  The result is the most prestigious 
database available internationally.

High standards of selection -- and data quality -- have made ISI a 
leader in the information industry. ISI has now applied similarly 
high selection standards 
(<A  HREF="http://www.isinet.com/isi/hot/essays/23.html">http://www.isinet.com/isi/hot/essays/23.html</A>), specialized to the

collection of high-quality, scholarly Web sites.  ISI editors have 
visited your site, reviewed it, developed a standardized descriptive 
record, written an abstract and created a link from CC Connect to

IN MEMORIAM

Two of the most important thinkers in the cybernetics and systems 
field have passed away during the last month: Herbert A. Simon (on 
=46eb. 9) and Claude E. Shannon (on Feb. 24).

Nobel laureate Herbert Simon was a truly universal mind, with 
contributions ranging from economics, psychology, management, 
evolutionary theory, and philosophy to artificial intelligence, a 
domain he helped to found. His focus was on the problem solving 
techniques that adaptive systems (people, organizations, computers, 
=2E..) use to cope with complexity. His book "The Sciences of the 
Artificial" provides a good introduction to his ideas. It includes 
his classic essay on "The Architecture of Complexity", where he 
proposed an evolutionary explanation for hierarchical organization, 
thus formulating one of the basic principles that came to underly our 
PCP philosophy.

Claude Shannon is the creator of the mathematical theory of 
information (or communication), and one of the founding members of 
the cybernetics group at MIT in the 1940's. A classic paper of his, 
"A mathematical theory of communication" (1948) had just been added 
the month before to our Principia Cybernetica Library. It is 
available at: <A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/Shannon-TheoryComm.pdf">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/Shannon-TheoryComm.pdf</A>

GLOBAL BRAIN

The plans to organize a conference on the Global Brain are starting 
to get a more concrete shape. An organizing committee has been 
formed, together with some mailing lists for the members. At present, 
the plan is to hold a small-scale preparatory workshop this summer 
(probably hosted by the PCP office at the Free University of 
Brussel), and a large conference next year (probably at San Jose 
State University) in Silicon Valley. Several prominent people are 
being invited to participate, including Bill Gates and computer 
pioneer Douglas Engelbart. A conference website and MUD are also 
being prepared.
