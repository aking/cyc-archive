&gt; Subject: Re: SUO: Proposed Changes to Merged Ontology
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	I am considering making three major changes to the 
&gt; version of the
&gt; &gt;merged ontology document that I sent out on January 12th, 
&gt; and I would like
&gt; &gt;to solicit comments.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me make a general comment, which arises from a recent discussion 
&gt; with Fritz Lehmann. He made the interesting observation that Cycorp 
&gt; have found that many of the most useful areas for writing axioms can 
&gt; be identified as those concerned with what might be called 
&gt; 'conceptually mixed' entities: things which cannot be entirely 
&gt; classified into one of the traditional ontological classifications 
&gt; but which have aspects of both. His example was 'informational 
&gt; objects', meaning physical things which carry information. Its easy 
&gt; to think of examples: scripts, notes, letters, email messages, 
&gt; magnetic tapes, movie film, etc. . What makes this a useful category, 
&gt; according to Fritz, is precisely that they do NOT fit wholly under 
&gt; one of the traditional classifications, which tend to make a sharp, 
&gt; high-level distinction between 'abstract' and 'concrete', and then 
&gt; put anything to do with information or structure under the former and 
&gt; anything physical under the latter. In other words, the traditional 
&gt; high-level classifications are useful, but they are most useful not 
&gt; as ways of categorising things, but as ways of classifying *aspects* 
&gt; of things, in some sense: and the most interesting things to focus on 
&gt; are those that have more than one aspect.  I found this a very 
&gt; interesting and compelling observation, and one that might have deep 
&gt; implications for the SUO.  In particular, many of the Sowa 
&gt; classifications are pretty dreadful if thought of as classifying 
&gt; things into disjoint categories, but they might be much more useful 
&gt; thought of as classifications of 'aspects' of things.

I agree with the general comment that it is often most useful to categorise
aspects of things rather than things themselves and with the particular
illustration that 'informational object' is a concept that does a lot of
work.   

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I would like to just get this issue on the table for now as 
&gt; something to discuss.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The proposed changes are as follows.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1.  Simplify the tip of the ontology so that it has the 
&gt; following structure.
&gt; 
&gt; Certainly this simplification is a great improvement, but it retains 
&gt; many of the most worrisome and misleading confusions of the original.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Individual Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Relation Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; 
&gt; The continuant/occurrent distinction, while popular, has many 
&gt; problems. Many things can be seen in either way, and indeed for many 
&gt; ordinary reasoning processes *must* be thought of in both ways: an 
&gt; ocean wave and a flame are two of my favorite examples, but others 
&gt; include weather phenomena, many chemical and biochemical processes, 
&gt; and various dynamic aspects of working industrial machinery 
&gt; (especially those involving moving liquids, such as combustion or 
&gt; hydraulics). If we are forced into a rigorous high-level distinction 
&gt; between 'things' and 'processes' as mutually exlcusive, then this in 
&gt; turn forces our practical ontologies to make many artificial 
&gt; distinctions which just get in the damned way, eg between a 
&gt; cloud-as-a-thing and a cloud-as-a-process, or between things and 
&gt; their lifetimes in a 4-d ontology. There is no need to do this, other 
&gt; than to satisfy a rather naive philosophical doctrine which is based 
&gt; on very shaky linguistic intuitions.
&gt; 

Well, we could distinguish ContinuantType from OccurrentType in much the
same way that Cyc distinguishes StuffType from ObjectType - ContinuantType
would be a class containing all the classes of continuants and OccurrentType
would be a class containing all the classes of occurrents.  The advantage of
this sort of structure is that it allows us to maintain the disjointness of
the high-level classes - there is no overlap between ContinuantType and
OccurrentType.  Furthermore, we can accomodate the observation that some
things are, e.g., process-like in some respects and object-like in others.
Furthermore, this approach would embody your general suggestion above about
categorizing aspects of things rather than things themselves, since classes
(or ways of describing things) are categorized as continuants/occurrents,
rather than the things themselves.

&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Object Physical)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Process Physical)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; 
&gt; I have a serious problem with the following (I was preparing a longer 
&gt; document about this, but I can cover the essential point in this 
&gt; message:)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Schema Abstract)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; 
&gt; This conflation of 'abstract' and 'continuant' doesn't seem to make 
&gt; sense. An 'abstract' is something which stands outside time: it has 
&gt; no temporal aspect or dependence at all; it doesnt even make sense to 
&gt; ask temporal questions about it.  (From the Sowa explanation: " Forms 
&gt; can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects such 
&gt; as sets and relations, but instances of forms cannot exist at a 
&gt; particular place and time without some physical encoding or 
&gt; embodiment. Whitehead called them "eternal objects" because they are 
&gt; independent of space and time." )
&gt; But a continuant is defined to be something that retains its identity 
&gt; during some time-interval. (Sowa again: "A continuant is an entity 
&gt; whose identity continues to be recognizable over some extended 
&gt; interval of time." )
&gt; 
&gt; So this notion of 'schema' seems incoherent; and since a lot of 
&gt; rather important stuff is classified under it, none of that makes 
&gt; sense either. This seems to me to be the single most central 
&gt; conceptual bug in the entire scheme, and one that must be repaired 
&gt; before the ontology can be of any real use.
&gt; 
&gt; Similar objections apply to "Script", for the same reason, since 
&gt; 'occurrent' means something that has a temporal location.

Well, if the "incoherence" of the subclassing of 'Schema' and 'Script' is
the "single most central conceptual bug" in the merged ontology, that's good
news, because I think it can be fairly easily debugged.  What if we just
replace the concept 'Abstract' by 'Informational Object' or
'ContentBearingObject' or some such notion?  Then we would have the
following relationships in the merged ontology.

(subclass-of SchemaObject ContentBearingObject)
(instance-of SchemaObject ContinuantType)
(subclass-of ScriptObject ContentBearingObject)
(instance-of ScriptObject OccurrentType)

Note that 'Schema' and 'Script' have been replaced by 'SchemaObject' and
'ScriptObject', since we are now concerned with the things that embody
schemas and scripts, as construed by Sowa.  Note too that the relationship
between 'SchemaObject' and 'ContinuantType' and between 'ScriptObject' and
'OccurrentType' is 'instance-of', rather than 'subclass-of'.  Finally, note
that 'ContentBearingObject' could be defined as follows, using Sowa's
original high-level notions.

(subclass-of ContentBearingObject Abstract)
(subclass-of ContentBearingObject Object)

At least we could do this as long as we're willing to concede that an
informational object is both a physical object and an abstract form (in some
sense).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Script Abstract)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; 
&gt; I have a similar problem understanding the following categories. In 
&gt; any sense of 'relation' I understand, it doesnt make sense to say 
&gt; that a relation is either a continuant or an occurent. Relations 
&gt; don't exist through time, they hold between entities. So what do 
&gt; these categories even mean?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Structure Relation)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Situation Relation)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For reference, the original upper-level class hierarchy, as 
&gt; proposed by John
&gt; &gt;Sowa, is as follows.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Independent Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Relative Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Mediating Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Actuality Independent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Actuality Physical)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Form Independent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Form Abstract)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Prehension Physical)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Prehension Relative)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Proposition Relative)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Proposition Abstract)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Nexus Physical)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Nexus Mediating)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Intention Abstract)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Intention Mediating)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Object Actuality)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Process Actuality)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Schema Form)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Script Form)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Juncture Prehension)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Juncture Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Participation Prehension)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Participation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Description Proposition)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Description Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of History Proposition)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of History Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Structure Nexus)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Situation Nexus)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Reason Intention)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Reason Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Purpose Intention)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Purpose Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2.  Recast the docu-strings for the high-level concepts in 
&gt; non-philosophical
&gt; &gt;language (so that their meaning is clear to engineers without a
&gt; &gt;philosophical background).
&gt; 
&gt; A noble ambition, but I doubt if it can be done. These are, after 
&gt; all, philosophical distinctions. 

Hmmm...  I guess I tend to think that anything worthwhile in philosophy can
be explained to non-philosophers, just as I think important results in
physics, chemistry, biology, etc. can be cashed out i a way that makes sense
to the layman.

&gt;Certainly these revisions don't cut 
&gt; it; and in fact I don't think they really make sense, in places.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The revised docu-strings follow.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Abstract "Pure information as distinguished from any
&gt; &gt;particular encoding of the information in a physical medium.
&gt; 
&gt; It is potentially misleading to refer to 'information' here. I doubt 
&gt; if many philosophers of mathematics or even working mathematicians 
&gt; would agree that the integers, for example, consisted of information. 
&gt; Suppose an engineer were to ask, reasonably enough, how many bytes 
&gt; were needed to encode the platonic ideal sphere?

Well, we don't really need the concept of 'Abstract' if we replace it with
something like 'ContentBearingThing' as suggested above.  However, if we do
decide to retain it (e.g. for the purpose of defining
'ContentBearingThing'), how about we use the following docu-sting?

(documentation Abstract "Properties or qualities as distinguished from any
particular embodiment of the properties/qualities in a physical medium.")

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Instances of
&gt; &gt;Abstract can be said to exist in the same sense as 
&gt; mathematical objects
&gt; 
&gt; Again, the term 'mathematical object' is potentially misleading.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;such
&gt; &gt;as sets and relations, but they cannot exist at a particular 
&gt; place and time
&gt; &gt;without some physical encoding or embodiment.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do 
&gt; not have spatial
&gt; &gt;dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, grammars, and the data
&gt; &gt;structures of computer science.  All the syntactic forms in natural
&gt; &gt;languages, programming languages, and versions of symbolic logic are
&gt; &gt;included under Arrangement.")
&gt; 
&gt; I honestly do not follow this. In my world, the forms of a language 
&gt; DO have spatial dimensions. The notion of a font size makes sense, 
&gt; for example, and data structures occupy physical memory. Linguistic 
&gt; forms are not mathematical abstractions (which is why the type/token 
&gt; contrast makes sense.)

OK, how about we use the following docu-string instead?

(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do not have spatial
dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, formal grammars, logics, and the
data structures of computer science.")

&gt; 
&gt; And why say only that mathematical abstractions don't have *spatial* 
&gt; dimensions? They also don't have temporal dimensions, or physical 
&gt; attributes, etc.; in fact there is quite a lot that they don't have.
&gt; 
&gt; But there's a deeper problem here in any case. This notion reflects a 
&gt; particular philosophy of mathematics which , while it is popular 
&gt; among pure mathematicians, isn't very useful in the real world. On 
&gt; this view, mathematics talks about a purely platonic world of 
&gt; "mathematical objects", in contrast to the physical world. I think 
&gt; this is a popular but fundamental mistake: mathematics in fact talks 
&gt; about anything, and this abstract 'platonic' world is a fictional way 
&gt; of refusing to commit oneself as to what particular thing one is 
&gt; talking about. Take the natural numbers, for example. When a shepherd 
&gt; stands counting his sheep, is he in fact talking about an abstract 
&gt; world of numbers which is in 1:1 correspondence with his sheep? No: 
&gt; he is talking about his sheep, and counting *them*. The philosophical 
&gt; need to postulate a world of 'pure numbers' arises when one wants to 
&gt; analyse the act of counting 'in the abstract', ie unencumbered by 
&gt; saying what particular things are being counted. But most of our 
&gt; ontologizing in practice is going to be about actual things; about 
&gt; sheep, not integers.

OK, once again I think we need to bear in mind what we're trying to do here.
We're not trying to formulate a fully adequate theory of the universe; we're
trying to construct an engineering artifact.  It may be the case that
Platonic forms don't exist (I for one don't believe in them), but that
doesn't negate the fact that Arrangement is a useful category - just
consider all of the examples given in the docu-string.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Assembly "A CorpuscularObject whose discrete parts are
&gt; &gt;completely separable.
&gt; 
&gt; What does 'completely separable' mean? (I can have the paint 
&gt; sandblasted off my car: is it therefore completely separable?)
&gt; 
&gt; This kind of distinction is like that between 'big' and 'small'. It 
&gt; is meaningful only in context, or as a comparative. One assembly 
&gt; might be more separable than another, in some sense, but nothing is 
&gt; either completely separable or completely inseparable. With enough 
&gt; energy input, you can probably take a quark apart.

I tend to agree with you here.  Perhaps John Sowa can defend the inclusion
of the concept in an upper-level ontology.

&gt; 
&gt; The rest of this explanation (below) is an extended riff on the theme 
&gt; of just how completely useless this distinction is for making any 
&gt; kind of classification. Apparently, a car can flip from being an 
&gt; assembly to not being one just by a shift in the intentions (or 
&gt; attentions) of the people who are thinking about what to do with it. 
&gt; OBVIOUSLY this isn't a useful way to classify things.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Whether something is considered an unstructured
&gt; &gt;collection or a structured assembly depends on some agent's 
&gt; intention.  A
&gt; &gt;car in working order is a highly structured assembly.  But 
&gt; if the parts were
&gt; &gt;disassembled and spread out on some surface, it would be called a
&gt; &gt;collection.  Yet if the parts were arranged to spell the 
&gt; word 'CAR', they
&gt; &gt;would again form an assembly, although not one that could be used for
&gt; &gt;transportation. Conversely, if a car were towed to the junk 
&gt; yard, the junk
&gt; &gt;dealer might consider it a collection, even though the parts 
&gt; were in the
&gt; &gt;same order they had been in while it was running.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Attribute "Primitive schemas, i.e. schemas 
&gt; that cannot be
&gt; &gt;defined in terms of other schemas.  Some examples are:  
&gt; colors, tastes,
&gt; &gt;intensities, etc.")
&gt; 
&gt; In what sense is a taste or a color a 'schema'? Color is a physical 
&gt; property of a surface (it has to do with the structure of the 
&gt; reflectance spectrum of the surface); it isnt a 'schema' in any sense 
&gt; I am aware of. It certainly isnt an "abstract form that has the 
&gt; structure of a continuant".  'intensity' seems to be, if anything, 
&gt; some kind of measuring scale (or maybe a class of such scales); 
&gt; again, I wouldnt put it into the same class as a taste or a color. 
&gt; (For example, tastes themselves might be more or less intense, so it 
&gt; would seem that intensity is something that *applies* to tastes, 
&gt; rather than being in the same category as tastes.)
&gt; 
&gt; I find this category completely without utility. I would never be 
&gt; inclined to use it in any ontological heirarchy, and if it was there 
&gt; it would just get in my way. Why, for example, should an attribute 
&gt; not be definable in terms of other attributes? Is sweet/sour not an 
&gt; attribute, if sweet and sour are?

OK, I see your point here.  I'll work on refining the docu-string.  Just for
the record, this one was entirely my own doing - it is not related to
anything in John Sowa's original upper-level ontology.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation CaseRole "The class of predicates relating 
&gt; the spatially
&gt; &gt;distinguished parts of an occurrent. Case roles include the 
&gt; agent, patient
&gt; &gt;or recipient of an action, the flammable substance in a 
&gt; burning process, or
&gt; &gt;the water that falls in rain.")
&gt; 
&gt; Another useless category. 'case role' is a LINGUISTIC idea, not an 
&gt; ontological one. (And it is only meaningful within one approach to 
&gt; describing linguistic structure which in any case isn't in the 
&gt; theoretical mainstream.)
&gt; 
&gt; More generally, almost all the categorisations in this ontology which 
&gt; depend on the occurrent/continuant distinction are fundamentally 
&gt; linguistic rather than ontological. They reflect ways of *talking* 
&gt; about the world, rather than ways the world in fact is. Since the 
&gt; very same thing can often - usually - be described as either a 
&gt; continuant or an occurrent, these pseudo-categories reflect an 
&gt; attitude rather than an objective structure. For example, take the 
&gt; 'water that falls in rain' example (which ought really to say the 
&gt; *drops* of water that fall in rain). If a rain is an event (or 
&gt; process) then the raindrops might be said to be its spatial parts, 
&gt; but then they could also be the spatial parts of the rainstorm 
&gt; considered as a continuant (rainstorms retain their identity through 
&gt; time, and even move across the landscape at measurable velocities. 
&gt; Some rainstorms even have been given proper names.); and moreover, 
&gt; since a raindrop is falling, it can itself be considered to be an 
&gt; occurrent, which is a part (in a different 'subprocess' sense) of a 
&gt; larger occurrent, and also a part (in yet another sense, if we are 
&gt; forced into making the high-level distinction between things and 
&gt; processes) of a continuant. In fact, one can take almost any 
&gt; reasonably well-defined and connected chunk of space-time and split 
&gt; it into pieces along spacelike boundaries (to get 'case roles') or 
&gt; along time-like boundaries (to get some other category of 'pieces') , 
&gt; but one can also split it along other, more complex, planes of 
&gt; division. If some piece of a machine starts to move, one can split 
&gt; the space-time of the machine so as to focus on, say, the leading 
&gt; edge of the moving part during the movement (is this an occurrent or 
&gt; a continuant? Why should I give a damn?)

OK, once again I think you are failing to bear in mind the engineering
perspective that we have to assume if we're going to get anything done here.
I know philosophers like to while away the hours wondering about whether
something is a merely linguistic categorization as opposed to a marker along
the noumenal contours of the world, but this shouldn't have any bearing
here.  We're trying to create a conceptual schema that, among other things,
promotes interoperability among information systems.  A linguistic
categorization may only reflect an "attitude", as you put it.  However, if
an attitude is culturally embedded (that is, if a large community assume
this attitude in their communications with one another), it matters a lot to
the culture, and, hence, it will probably matter a lot to the information
systems that they construct.  Therefore, a conceptual schema that does not
incorporate the categorization corresponding to this attitute will be
crippled in this respect.  

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation ComponentRelation "An umbrella class for any 
&gt; binary relation
&gt; &gt;that relates an Object to an aspect of that object.  The 
&gt; three elements of
&gt; &gt;ComponentRelation are part-of, property-of, and stage-of.")
&gt; 
&gt; What on earth does that mean? What is an aspect? (What isn't an 
&gt; aspect, better question.) How can a binary relation have three 
&gt; 'elements'?

Well, ComponentRelation is a class of binary relations.  This does not imply
that ComponentRelation itself is a binary relation.  Furthermore, I don't
understand your objection to "aspect" here.  You began this response by
arguing that we *ought* to categorize aspects of things rather than things
themselves.  

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is an entity whose identity
&gt; &gt;continues to be recognizable over some extended interval of time.")
&gt; 
&gt; This is a very poor definition, by the way, since almost *anything* 
&gt; physical has an identity which extends over *some* period of time. 
&gt; Also, it is a mistake to introduce the essentially epistemic notion 
&gt; of 'recognizable' into what ought to be a clearly non-epistemic 
&gt; notion. The classical definition of continuant is something which is 
&gt; such that all its parts are wholly present whenever it is present, 
&gt; which means essentially that its parts are considered to be spatial 
&gt; rather than temporal. So a human body, say, is a continuant, while a 
&gt; race or a football match are not, since they have temporal 'parts' 
&gt; like beginnings and endings or first and second halves.

OK, I like your suggested way of reformulating the comment.  If no one has
any objection, I'll replace the version above with the one below.

(documentation Continuant "A continuant is any entity whose parts are wholly
present whenever it is present.")

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is 
&gt; indefinitely divisible to
&gt; &gt;the limits of perception by the available sense organs or measuring
&gt; &gt;instruments.")
&gt; 
&gt; How do we classify things which are partly continuous and partly not? 
&gt; (You know, like almost any complicated piece of machinery, say; or a 
&gt; company, for example.)
&gt; Again, it is poor strategy to introduce epistemic notions like 
&gt; perception into the explanation.

Again, I understand that you philosophers are very prudish about the
epistemological/metaphysical distinction, and that's fine - every discipline
has its sacred cows.  However, I don't see that we have to be similarly
circumspect in this context.  We're trying to develop a formalization of
those categories which are most important to us.  Whether those categories
issue from the world itself or are simply superimposed on the world by our
perceptual/cognitive machinery is irrelevant for the purposes of the SUO, I
would claim.  If a high-level category either directly or indirectly can be
expected to promote information-sharing, it should be included in our
developing conceptual schema.  If it's merely a product of the parlor games
of the 17th-century leisured class, then perhaps we can do without it. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation ContinuousProcess "A process in which 
&gt; incremental changes
&gt; &gt;take place continuously.  This is the normal kind of 
&gt; physical process.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation CorpuscularObject "An Object that has 
&gt; separable parts.")
&gt; 
&gt; See earlier comments on 'separable'.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which 
&gt; is typical of
&gt; &gt;computer programs or idealized approximations to physical 
&gt; processes, changes
&gt; &gt;occur in discrete steps called events, which are interleaved 
&gt; with periods of
&gt; &gt;inactivity called states.")
&gt; 
&gt; This is a neat idea, but very hard to get right. The problem is to 
&gt; say just what a period of inactivity is. That seems obvious until you 
&gt; try to axiomatize it. For example, consider someone who falls asleep 
&gt; while leaning on a door, thereby preventing the door from opening. In 
&gt; a sense he isnt doing anything, just being there in an inactive 
&gt; state; but if someone is trying to open the door, he IS doing 
&gt; something: he is preventing them opening the door. (Under the right 
&gt; surrounding circumstances he could be accused of negligent homicide.) 
&gt; In computers we do have a fairly clear criterion for this notion of 
&gt; 'inactivity', but computers are carefully crafted to make that 
&gt; possible. On the other hand, there are plenty of examples of physical 
&gt; processes which are best described as discrete, eg the motion of a 
&gt; shuttle in a loom, or the action of a valve tappet; but these are not 
&gt; interleaved with complete inactivity.

I agree that the docu-string needs to be reworded.  I'll give some thought
to this, and perhaps John Sowa has some suggestions.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals.  
&gt; This is the root
&gt; &gt;node of the ontology.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation HomogeneousObject "A ContinuousObject in 
&gt; which every part is
&gt; &gt;similar to every other in every relevant respect, e.g., temperature,
&gt; &gt;chemical constitution, density, etc.  An example would be a 
&gt; beaker of pure
&gt; &gt;distilled water in a controlled environment.")
&gt; 
&gt; This depends crucially on what you consider to be a 'relevant' 
&gt; aspect. See later comments on variableObject.

Right.  Why don't we replace "relevant respect" with "physical property"?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Individual "An entity that can be 
&gt; characterized independently
&gt; &gt;of any relationships it may have to other entities.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation KineticForm "Includes the information in a 
&gt; reel of motion
&gt; &gt;picture film or the patterns and equations for generating 
&gt; motion in virtual
&gt; &gt;reality.")
&gt; 
&gt; See comments on 'script' later.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Object "A Physical Continuant which retains 
&gt; its identity over
&gt; &gt;some interval of time. Although no physical entity is ever 
&gt; permanent, an
&gt; &gt;object can have stable properties over its lifespan. The type Object
&gt; &gt;includes ordinary physical objects as well as the 
&gt; instantiations of classes
&gt; &gt;in object-oriented programming languages.")
&gt; 
&gt; That last sentence is in direct opposition to the notion that 
&gt; datastructures are 'arrangements' (see above), since in that case 
&gt; they are not physical objects. You can't have it both ways. (I think 
&gt; this an extremely silly idea, and amounts to basing a primary 
&gt; ontological classification on a simple pun. It would be like claiming 
&gt; that subatomic particles should be classified with fruit because they 
&gt; both have colors.)

I agree.  I think the Object class should be restricted to physical objects.
I'll revise the docu-string accordingly.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a 
&gt; stable identity
&gt; &gt;during any interval of time. Formally, Occurrent satisfies 
&gt; the following
&gt; &gt;conditions:
&gt; &gt;   * The temporal parts of an occurrent exist at different times.
&gt; &gt;   * The spatial parts of an occurrent may exist at the same 
&gt; time, but an
&gt; &gt;occurrent may have 	different spatial parts at different times
&gt; &gt;   * There are no identity conditions that can be used to 
&gt; identify two
&gt; &gt;occurrents that are 	observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions.
&gt; &gt;A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different 
&gt; stages of a
&gt; &gt;life cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant, 
&gt; such as the
&gt; &gt;person's fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable 
&gt; identity conditions
&gt; &gt;at each stage. Even then, the identification depends on an 
&gt; inference that
&gt; &gt;presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")
&gt; 
&gt; The above is highly incoherent. I will just make a few 
&gt; obvious comments.
&gt; 1. the temporal parts of ANYTHING exist at different times, by 
&gt; definition of 'temporal part'. (What you ought to have said is that 
&gt; occurrents HAVE temporal parts, in contrast to continuants.)
&gt; 2. A continuant can also have different spatial parts at different 
&gt; times: your body, for example, renews itself almost completely during 
&gt; an average year.
&gt; 3. There ARE identity conditions which can be used to identify 
&gt; occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping spacetime regions. For 
&gt; example, one can identify the two halves of a soccer match.
&gt; 4. Or, to take the other example, one CAN recognize two different 
&gt; stages in someone's life. And, contrary to Aristotle and his 
&gt; followers, this does NOT always require that a continuant be 
&gt; identified 'at each stage'. That might indeed be a sound basis for 
&gt; legal rules of evidence, but it is not a philosophical requirement. 
&gt; The basic identity condition for being two stages of one life are 
&gt; that there is a life of which the stages are stages, and that is all. 
&gt; Whether this 'life' is a continuant or an occurrent is irrelevant to 
&gt; the basic rule of identity.  Now, how one *recognizes* this identity 
&gt; is another matter, and a potentially very complicated one, requiring 
&gt; a detailed analysis of what it takes to perform an act of recognition 
&gt; and many other arcane and complex issues in psychology: but this is 
&gt; all COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to ontological classification.

OK, how about we revise the docu-string for 'Occurrent' as follows:

(documentation Occurrent "An entity that has temporal parts and, thus, does
not have a stable identity
during any interval of time.")

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation OrganicObject "A CorpuscularObject such as a 
&gt; tree or flower
&gt; &gt;that has parts that are not completely separable, even 
&gt; though there are
&gt; &gt;discontinuities.")
&gt; 
&gt; Being organic is simply a matter of how well-connected your parts are 
&gt; to one another? It has nothing to do with carbon-based chemistry, or 
&gt; an elan vital, or nothing like that at all?

I agree that this sounds a bit wierd.  Perhaps John Sowa can clarify the
intent here.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Physical "An entity that has a location in 
&gt; space-time.")
&gt; 
&gt; A technical question: do spaces and times themselves have a location 
&gt; in spacetime? (My own preference is to say not, but Cyc takes a 
&gt; different view. But either way, we need a clear answer to avoid 
&gt; rapidly descending into muddled axioms.)

OK, let's just pick one option or the other and go with it.  I don't think
any engineering applications will be hampered by our decision to assign or
not assign spaces and times themselves a location in spacetime.  

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent 
&gt; specification of
&gt; &gt;actions and events: including: computer programs, 
&gt; finite-state machines,
&gt; &gt;Petri nets, robot commands, cooking recipes, musical scores, 
&gt; conference
&gt; &gt;schedules, driving directions, and the scripts of actions 
&gt; and dialog in
&gt; &gt;plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent 
&gt; a dynamic
&gt; &gt;process, it may have static parts.  In a movie film, for example, the
&gt; &gt;sequence of images is a script that determines the motion, 
&gt; but each frame is
&gt; &gt;a schema of a static image.")
&gt; 
&gt; See comments below on 'schema' and 'script'. Also this list is very 
&gt; confusing, since some of the things in it are linguistic in nature 
&gt; (computer programs), others are mathematical abstractions (Petri 
&gt; nets) and others are physical (musical scores and movie film). In 
&gt; what sense is a movie film a 'specification' ?

OK, how about we revise the docu-string as follows?

(documentation Procedure "A sequence-dependent specification of actions and
events.  Some examples are computer programs, finite-state machines, cooking
recipes, musical scores, conference schedules, driving directions, and the
scripts of actions and dialog in plays and movies.")

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Process "A Physical Occurrent during the interval of
&gt; &gt;interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail, 
&gt; the same actual
&gt; &gt;entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic 
&gt; process. Even an entity
&gt; &gt;as stable as a diamond could be considered a process when 
&gt; viewed over a long
&gt; &gt;time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")
&gt; 
&gt; Quite. So there is no useful categorical distinction to be 
&gt; made, as I suggest.
&gt; (BTW, what is the 'interval of interest', exactly?)

I think this problem is resolved by making 'Process' an instance of
'OccurrentType'.  In that case, something can be seen as either an object or
a process, but the kind 'Process' is an 'OccurrentType', while 'Object'
would be a 'ContinuantType'.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In 
&gt; logic, the assertion
&gt; &gt;of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds 
&gt; to some aspect
&gt; &gt;or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an 
&gt; example, the
&gt; &gt;statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat 
&gt; characterizes the
&gt; &gt;entity named Yojo.")
&gt; 
&gt; This doesnt seem to distinguish the sentence from the proposition 
&gt; expressed by that sentence. Exactly what a proposition is, is a 
&gt; matter of controversy, but in at least one view, it isnt anything at 
&gt; all like a sentence. BTW, what exactly is the word "Cat" supposed to 
&gt; indicate in that last sentence?

Well, we could replace the concept of Proposition (which probably is of much
more interest to philosophers than engineers) with that of Sentence.  We
could then make the latter an immediate subclass of 'ContentBearingObject'.
Or perhaps we could make 'Sign' an immediate subclass of
'ContentBearingObject' and 'Sentence' an immediate subclass of 'Sign' and
'Arrangement'.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some 
&gt; other entity.")
&gt; 
&gt; ? The relation is an entity in a relationship to some other entity? 
&gt; So if (R a b), R is not the relation, but a and b are? This is just 
&gt; nonsense.

OK, how about the following instead?

(documentation Relation "A set of ordered n-tuples.")

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Schema "An Abstract form that has the structure of a
&gt; &gt;Continuant and, thus, does not specify time or timelike 
&gt; relationships.
&gt; &gt;Examples include geometric forms, the syntactic structures 
&gt; of sentences in
&gt; &gt;some language, or the encodings of pictures in a multimedia system.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Script "An Abstract form that has the structure of an
&gt; &gt;Occurrent and, thus, represents time sequences.
&gt; 
&gt; Both of these (and 'kineticForm') are muddled ideas. They confuse the 
&gt; structure of the form with the structure of what the form describes. 

OK, I agree with you here.  What if we use the following docu-strings
instead?

(documentation SchemaObject "An object that embodies information that has
the structure of a Continuant and, thus, does not specify time or timelike
relationships.  An example would be a box that embodies the geometric form
of a cube.")

(documentation Script "An object that embodies information that has the
structure of an Occurrent and, thus, represents time sequences.")

&gt; First, as noted earlier, abstract forms simply do not (cannot) have 
&gt; spatiotemporal properties such as being continuants or occurrents; 
&gt; but even if we were to somehow allow them to have such aspects, there 
&gt; is no connection between the structure of the form and the structure 
&gt; of what the form describes.  We are all intimately familiar with 
&gt; various notations which give spatial renderings of temporal 
&gt; relationships, and many of us have seen temporal representations of 
&gt; spatial relationships (a slow pan in a movie, for example). More 
&gt; acutely, there are many, many abstractions throughout mathematics 
&gt; which are entirely neutral as to the spatial or temporal aspects of 
&gt; their interpretation. The widespread Allen algebra of timeintervals 
&gt; for example is in fact a theory of intervals, and can be applied to 
&gt; spatial intervals just as well as to temporal ones.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Examples include computer
&gt; &gt;programs, a recipe for baking a cake, a sheet of music to be 
&gt; played on a
&gt; &gt;piano, or a differential equation that governs the evolution 
&gt; of a physical
&gt; &gt;process. A movie can be described by several different kinds 
&gt; of scripts: the
&gt; &gt;first is a specification of the actions and dialog to be acted out by
&gt; &gt;humans; but the sequence of frames in a reel of film is also 
&gt; a script that
&gt; &gt;determines a process carried out by a projector that 
&gt; generates flickering
&gt; &gt;images on a screen.")
&gt; 
&gt; A movie film, it seems, is many things at once. It is a continuant 
&gt; which is also a procedure which is also a script.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Sign "A Sign is considered as representing 
&gt; something to some
&gt; &gt;agent.")
&gt; 
&gt; Just a quibble, but I think that it might be more use to characterise 
&gt; a sign as something intended by one agent to represent something for 
&gt; another agent (or agents). People often find meaning in things that 
&gt; arent usually categorised as signs (except in a metaphorical sense), 
&gt; cf. many folk sayings about smoke and fire.

OK, this sounds like a good refinement.  Why don't we rephrase the
docu-string as follows?

(documentation Sign "A Sign is something that is intended by one agent to
represent something to another agent or agents.  Note that this definition
excludes natural phenomena and their interpretation, e.g. a cloud formation
that resembles a physical object.") 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Situation "A Relational entity considered as 
&gt; an Occurrent. A
&gt; &gt;situation relates the participants in some process, whose 
&gt; stages may involve
&gt; &gt;different participants at different times.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Structure "A Relational entity considered as 
&gt; a Continuant. A
&gt; &gt;structure relates multiple objects whose connections constitute the
&gt; &gt;structure.")
&gt; 
&gt; Both the above are clumsy because of the awkwardness of the 
&gt; occurrent/continuant contrast. Rainstorms have a dynamic structure, 
&gt; for example, and cells (in biology) are structures which consist of 
&gt; interlocking processes. The very idea of 'dynamic equilibrium' 
&gt; couldnt be considered in this overly simplistic ontological 
&gt; classification.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject that 
&gt; nonetheless varies
&gt; &gt;in, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, etc.  
&gt; An example
&gt; &gt;would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")
&gt; 
&gt; Consider a homogenous object which has the same chemical consituency, 
&gt; temperature, etc., throughout; like a cube of pure gold. It is as 
&gt; unVariable as one could possibly achieve, let us suppose. 
&gt; Nevertheless, it does vary in some ways. Parts of it, for example, 
&gt; are further north than other parts, and again, some parts of it are 
&gt; higher in the gravity field than other parts. So its parts can be 
&gt; distinguished from each other. Now, is it therefore a VariableObject? 
&gt; I suspect you will want to say not, but on what basis? You cannot 
&gt; claim that *every* property of all its parts are shared by all its 
&gt; other parts. What I suspect you want to say is that all its parts 
&gt; have the same *intrinsic* properties, maybe, or maybe the same 
&gt; *physical* properties. Or maybe you could say that the object is made 
&gt; of the same *stuff* throughout. But in any case, you do need to say 
&gt; what it is you actually do mean.

I agree.  Why don't we rephrase the docu-string as follows?

(documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject whose physical properties
may nonetheless vary.  That is, the temperature, chemical constitution,
density, etc. may change from one part to another.  An example of a
VariableObject would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;3.  The third proposed change is to eliminate the axioms of 
&gt; the "Theory of
&gt; &gt;Holes".  As I see it, these axioms are very interesting, but 
&gt; they are also
&gt; &gt;controversial and probably more relevant in a philosophical 
&gt; context than an
&gt; &gt;engineering one like the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, engineering is largely concerned with holes, as a matter of 
&gt; fact (see any history of machine tools: all the great manufacturing 
&gt; advances were based on new ways to remove metal, usually so as to 
&gt; make holes with greater precision. Modern auto manufacturing began 
&gt; with the centerless precision grinder. ) So we will almost certainly 
&gt; need *some* ontology of holes. In fact, I think that this is likely 
&gt; to be a lot more use to engineering than all that stuff about scripts 
&gt; and situations and signs.

OK, I've put the theory of holes back into the merged ontology.
