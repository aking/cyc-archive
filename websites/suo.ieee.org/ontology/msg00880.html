&gt; &gt; &gt; Jon,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I like your explanation:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  "Matthew"  is a sign that denotes Matthew   (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  "x"        is a sign that denotes x         (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  "&lt;x, y&gt;"   is a sign that denotes &lt;x, y&gt;    (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  "R"        is a sign that denotes {&lt;x, y&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; in R} (ITRW).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; '"Matthew"' is a sign that denotes "Matthew" (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; '"x"'       is a sign that denotes "x"       (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; '"&lt;x, y&gt;"'  is a sign that denotes "&lt;x, y&gt;"  (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; '"R"'       is a sign that denotes "R"       (in the real world).
&lt;...&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's a pattern here.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My only addition is a suggestion that we use KIF
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the base language of signs for the purpose of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the SUO, and we define the terms in other languages,
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as English, conceptual graphs, etc., by their
&gt; &gt; &gt; translation to KIF.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I repeat my earlier caveat:  This proposal does
&gt; &gt; &gt; not solve any philosophical problems, it doesn't answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; any linguistic questions, and it makes no claim that KIF
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the best language for everything that one might want
&gt; &gt; &gt; to use a language for.  But it allows the work on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUO to proceed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; John Sowa
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; KIF, in the shape that we currently know it, and, for that matter,
&gt; &gt; most of the popular systems for expressing FOL, are not languages
&gt; &gt; that I can think in, for the reason that they preclude me, either
&gt; &gt; through their deliberate inexpressiveness or their computational
&gt; &gt; inefficiency, from being able to address the research issues that
&gt; &gt; are of pressing concern and present interest to me, like whether
&gt; &gt; the functional (procedural) and the logical (declarative) aspects
&gt; &gt; of computational (in the broadest sense) languages can be better
&gt; &gt; integrated than they currently are, just to name a single issue
&gt; &gt; that leaps to mind.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  If I understand you correctly, you are concerned with
&gt; the K-lunk between something declarative, like KIF, and what
&gt; sits underneath it that at some level has to be procedural
&gt; (or is that a von Neuman limitation?)  That sounds reasonable,
&gt; but I guess not the first order of play here.

I will chose to interpret "K-lunk" in a way that is charitable --
to myself! -- as "knowledge link", but no, well yes, now that you
mention it, anyway, at the time that I said this I was probably only
conscious of thinking about the contrast between declarative languages --
like Prolog, for one, was initially aimed to be -- where the relation
between problems and solutions is described in "purely logical" terms,
and the task of the underlying programming system is to do all of the
procedural dirty work of actually constructing particular instances
of that relation, typically the ones that correlate with the input
problem instance.  But I have also been concerned for quite some
time now -- I really oughta try reading my own dissertation! --
with a more general sense of "underlying dynamics", not always
specified in procedural code or machine code, but implicit in
the action, behavior, conduct, development, and evolution of
the entire "symbolically computable information" (SCI) system,
even as its use is "embedded", "indexed", or "situated" within
the surrounding "community of inquiry" (COI).

The short answer, I reckon, is that I am aware that this desideratum
of mine is "not the first order of play here", but it is just one of
the obstacles against which or around which I will need to make some
headway in order to have any particular use for the resulting system.

You may consider it a reminiscence, or a lapse of nostalgia, if you wish --
I was just trying to remember some of the reasons why I ever took up with
these silicon-blasted machines in the first place!  But I do, after all,
think that it represents a "non-obviable general obstruction" (NOGO)
that lies before our common advance, whatever riot, rout, ruckus
that its e-gress may apparently be constituting at times.

&gt; &gt; Why would I want to be a part of building a language that
&gt; &gt; I myself would not use, could not use for any significant
&gt; &gt; purpose under the sun?   Why would I want to sell to others,
&gt; &gt; to impose on others, a language that they will have so much
&gt; &gt; trouble, with mechanized help or otherwise, using to think?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I'm not over enamoured of KIF myself, we have not stopped developing 
&gt; EXIST because of it.  My personal strategy is to assume KIF will work and
&gt; wait for it to break.  If you can identify the points where it breaks from
&gt; prior experience, that would be helpful.

You can do this, a bit, I can do this, just a bit,
but Dear Laocoön, who will be left to listen when
their lessons are done?  I for one, am just a bit
burned out on the Arthurian Glamour of the belief
that democracy, or that bright dream of democracy,
can do what science has not the nerve to undertake,
and though my disillusionment is transitory, I'm sure,
nothing that four years of I-told-you-so's won't cure,
that does not mean, should Mankind survive, that much
of the meanwhile whiling away will be a blissèd idyll!

&gt; &gt; I never know where any language might be capable of going over time,
&gt; &gt; and so the only features that I see worth criticizing in FOL or KIF
&gt; &gt; are the features that would keep them cast in stone, fixed in place,
&gt; &gt; or rooted to the spots that they currently inhabit.  Folks said that
&gt; &gt; they were interested in feedback -- and that gave me sufficient hope,
&gt; &gt; way back in the beginning, that I contributed the bit of stuff that
&gt; &gt; I learned over thirty years of working in the sub-basement of logic,
&gt; &gt; but "I get no takers".  I suspect that I have become one more victim
&gt; &gt; of that human, all too human "Paradox Of Social Axiology" (POSA), the
&gt; &gt; one where people say:   "Well, if somebody is trying to give it to us
&gt; &gt; for free, it must be either (1) worthless, (2) a disease, or (3) both".
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Well I can hardly manage the ground floor of logic,
&gt; having come from elsewhere, so I am not always in a good
&gt; position to comment on these things.  But I have been
&gt; listening.  I think the key is to hasten the point
&gt; when people say "Oh that's what he means", though
&gt; I am sure that at least some people don't want
&gt; to hear.

Well, my meaning is this:  It is the purpose of software
to soften those tasks that we humans find too hard to do.

In spite of all of the time that I have spent doing and thinking about logic,
I still find that my easy intuitions desert me, in some purely propositional
question, whenever the number of logical variables exceeds that magic mumber
of 7+or-2.  So I am wrote a program to help me with that.  And I am not too
proud to use it when I need it.  The problems that we have are really tough,
but in this business, we ought to think of that as job security.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Another one of those things that will kill
&gt; &gt; any try at open collaboration.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  The only rule of collaboration I know is that you have to
&gt; keep participating, keep presenting examples (that the audience
&gt; will understand) of what the problem is, and what the solution
&gt; might, or needs to look like.

Still here.
 
&gt; MW:  Personally I could do with a high level
&gt;      road map of where you want to go.

Well, that is the current draft of my dissertation,
plus the collection of its supporting documents --
this is 2000+ pages and growing, and not even
my committee has read it all yet, or lately,
and so I would not inflict it on you unless
I could manage in a dialogous way, to show
that it has any bearing on common concerns.
But that will most likely be an even more
extenuated act of circumstantiation ...

&gt; &gt; And so it goes,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; P.S.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Oh yes, I already know the comeback.
&gt; &gt; I have written a few  peculiar bits
&gt; &gt; here and there, so that must be the
&gt; &gt; reason.  But I have written many more
&gt; &gt; absolutely boringly non-comically straight
&gt; &gt; bits all over the place, which you may notice
&gt; &gt; get, comparatively speaking, next to nothing
&gt; &gt; like the same level of attention. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Most things get more attention than the response would indicate.
&gt; Most people struggle to read the list, never mind contribute.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why is that?  Because some local  authority says
&gt; &gt; that it's wrong?  Is that the method of inquiry?
&gt; &gt; There is a way to find out if a given statement
&gt; &gt; is wrong.  Even the Ancients, who had no science,
&gt; &gt; or logic, or brains, or anything knew a little bit
&gt; &gt; about it.  Or you could bet that we would not be
&gt; &gt; here to be trashing their knowledge, that is,
&gt; &gt; if you are given to existential proofs.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Being different and having different ideas is just plain difficult.

The remainder of this peevishness on my part
I will not even try to rationalize, but just
chalk it up to my abcessed tooth -- "a poor
excuse is better than none!" my folks used
to say, in their blessedly ironic way.

Back To Work,

Jon Awbrey
