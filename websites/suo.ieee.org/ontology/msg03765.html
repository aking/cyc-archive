DM = Douglas McDavid
JA = Jon Awbrey

DM: The answer to your question:

JA: | anyway, i gather that it's the bare form of the logical skeleton,
    | not the contingent fats of the beasty flesh that matter the most
    | here, don't you?&quot;

DM: is, for my part, &quot;No.&quot;

I was trying to answer your question:

DM: So what are you (or Peirce) actually trying to say?

Consequently, it was only what I guessed to be the intent of your question
and what I guessed to be the intent of Peirce's (purloined) example that
I was addressing when I speculated on what might &quot;matter the most here&quot;.

DM: At least it's hard for me to take seriously the argument
    that the logical skeleton is a valuable way to express
    serious, useful information about the world, when the
    examples provided aren't serious, useful information
    about the world.  It's like:  &quot;It's not important
    that we get the pragmatic semantics correct with
    these simple heuristic examples, because that
    part is too time consuming, or too difficult
    in some way, but it should be no problem for
    y'all students to get it right when you go
    to use these tools on unrestricted, real
    world complexity.&quot;

DM: At least that's my take on the situation.

If you really want to take every example with that kind of
literal exactness, then you render the problem of judging
theories far too easy -- All theories are false, the end.

My dictionary says that swine are omnivores, fine.
So we can make a substitution if it's important.
It's not actually important to the example --
some folks would say that logic is about
possible worlds, but let's not go there.

The fact is, that when it comes to these kinds of classes
there really are no facts of the matter -- there are but
conventions of speech.  Ordinary cattle, taken neat,
are called herbivores, but feed them the brains of
their kin ground up in feed, and they eat it, and
for the lack of knowing what kind they are, the
herds of a nation must be burned.  &quot;Omnivore&quot;
is itself ambiguous.  Pigs will eat anything
is one sense, but being a genuine carnivore,
raw in tooth in claw, like dogs and tigers,
can often mean a little more than that, it
evokes a natural hunter in the wild, and
only wild boars qualify for that trophy.
I have no idea what might have been the
most salient features to the example's
original inventor, and then again,
the true quarry may have always
been a hypothetical question.

I know what a real scientific taxonomy looks like,
and even that is fuzzy at the edges, but nothing
we've seen in our neighborhood even comes close.
Still, we will not acquire, much less build,
the sorts of logical software that we will
need to cope with such a taxonomy, and by
that I mean something beyond hanging some
old chart on the wall and staring at it,
if we do not build our faculties and our
utilities for logic, and by that I mean
applied and approximate logic, up from
the scratch that we currently possess.

Just my guess,

Jon Awbrey
