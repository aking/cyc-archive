Matthew,

MW: Well as Jon has said, what he is talking about is not research in
the &quot;novel&quot; sense of hte word, more a bringing together of strands from
a range of disciplines.

JS: I use the term 'research' loosely.  I'm open to using a different term,
but I think we all know the nature of this type of posting.  Others post
similar stuff, but the volume has not been a problem. 

&gt; But it is not acceptable to conduct this research in this 
&gt; forum without
&gt; any relationship to the work of this group.  Again, it is not 
&gt; enough that
&gt; it relates to the Scope and Purpose.

MW: Well here I think you are wide of the mark. I think that Jon has
a valuable contribution to make. I don't deny that there
are issues in the manner of it though.

JS: I scanned and counted 1300 postings to SUO.  How much of this has
resulted in standards words?  If it could be translated into standards
words, that needs to be done.  If it can't, it's eating bandwidth and not
contributing.  I'm guessing his work has either advanced the field of
ontology or built consensus on some topics, which is good research, but
doesn't belong on the SUO list unless it feeds directly into a standards
document.  If there were a finite number of research topics that could be
addressed in the next few years, it would be OK to work through them, but
there are an infinite number of research topics that will take eternity.
There's also an easy alternative: Introduce the topic to the SUO list, then
move it to the Ontology list, then come back with conclusions in the form of
standards words. What is wrong with this?

&gt; 
&gt; JA:  &gt; 4.  You do not seem to get the fact that I am doing my 
&gt; level best
&gt; &gt;     to accord you the professional service of telling you exactly
&gt; &gt;     how these prospective standards will be judged by the academic,
&gt; &gt;     professional, and user communities with which I am very 
&gt; &gt; familiar.
&gt; &gt;     I simply think that it is better that the Group should hear 
&gt; &gt; about
&gt; &gt;     it now, while there is still time to fix it, rather than waiting
&gt; &gt;     to roundly ridiculed by the first elect body of external experts
&gt; &gt;     to which these inept pretensions of expertise present 
&gt; &gt; themselves.
&gt; &gt;     Hear me now, and believe me later, as I think the line goes.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: Standards groups start with a document and improve it.  


MW: No they don't, or at least not where I come from. For exmaple, in
developing ISO18876 we spent 3 years making sure we understood what we
were doing before we started developing the standard itself, in response
to a requirement set that initiated the work.

JS: I was responding to Jon, who seems to feel it's a contribution to
criticize a document without offering improvements.  In standards
development, as you well know, the process (once you have a base document)
is to offer improvements, not just sit back and criticize.  But your are
technically correct, I should have said, &quot;Once a group has started document,
it works to improve it.&quot;

&gt; It helps
&gt; little to just criticize it.  You should help to improve one of both
&gt; documents.  If you don't think either are worth your input, you should
&gt; either submit your own starter document, listen quietly, or 
&gt; leave.  You
&gt; should not eat up bandwidth with your research. 

MW: Well bandwidth is a problem, but otherwise I disagree. Jon is trying
to make a positive contribution, but he is not being very successful
because of the manner of the contribution, even given that he has improved
significantly of late (IMHO).

JS: I am in favor of Jon trying your approach.  I think it would reduce
quanity (which could itself solve the problem) and increase group
acceptance, but he should still work to get his conclusions into standards
words. 

MW: This is misrepresenting what Jon is doing. He is not creating new
stuff, he is presenting the existing stuff that is (or should be)
relevant. Even I have got that far.

JS: OK, 'research' is the wrong word.  If it is relevant, it should
sometimes result in standards words. 

MW: I have been trying to point out in this note where I think you
are wrong in your criticisms of Jon. You have been deeming the
content of his contributions innappropriate. You are probably wrong here.
And he has moved to comply (e.g. by stating specifically how it related 
to scope and purpose) which was not what you expected, because you were
(IMHO) attacking the wrong problem. It is the manner of Jon's contribution
that would bear improvement.

JS: It would be good if I were wrong.  Jon, are you willing to try Matthew's
approach?
