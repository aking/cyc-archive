<p>Jean-Marc,

<p>JM:&nbsp; Isn't the ground of the nature of a "form"

<p>JA:&nbsp; I am tempted to agree, and I probably would if I could use
the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words "form" and "relational structure" in
the ways that I am
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; already used to, but I cannot be sure yet
of the way that you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may intend them, so I must hesitate until
I know your meaning.
<p>JM:&nbsp; my meaning would be, a collection of points and relations
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between these points so that no point is left
alone.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | "... the phaneron is made up entirely of
qualities of

made up of points. ...
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; no collection of points ... without
the idea of the objects
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; being brought together can in itself
constitute space."
<p>JM:&nbsp; What is yours?
<p>Form.&nbsp; From Latin "forma" = "beauty".
<br>There's more to say, of course, but
<br>that is all you really need to know.
<p>Relational Structure.&nbsp; Any relation
<br>viewed with an eye to its form, q.v.
<p>Relation.&nbsp; Here I see two cases:
<p>1.&nbsp; Relation in Extension = a set of tuples.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuple = finite sequence of elements from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a predesignated set or collection of sets.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the tuples all have the same cardinality k,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then they are called k-tuples and the relation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is said to have "arity", "adicity", "valence" k.
<p>2.&nbsp; Relation in Intension = a property ("intension")
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is common to all of the elements in a set.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nota bene:&nbsp; Saying that a property is shared
by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the elements in a set is different from
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saying that the property is a property of a set.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elements of a relation in intension are known
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as "elementary relations".&nbsp; These are the analogues,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in intension, of the tuples in extension.
<p>For the past many years, all against my first inclinations,
<br>I have been working to develop the extensional side of the
<br>theory of sign relations, simply because this area is less
<br>crowded, because far less work has been done on this face
<br>of the mountain, and because this is the side of things
<br>that makes a connection with empirical efforts, say,
<br>in databases, ethology, and qualitative research.
<p>JA:&nbsp; In the 1st category we find the relations of O to O, S to
S, I to I.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 2nd category we find the relations
of O to S, O to I, S to I.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 3rd category we find the relations
of O, S, I, in 3-foldness.
<p>JM:&nbsp; These would be the degenerate categories of thirdness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that it is better to build the categories
so
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that they are hierachized but still be independent
of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each other.&nbsp; How do you express the fact
that genuine
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secondness is independent of genuine thirdness?
<p>I have the feeling that "independent" may be another one of
<br>those words that we use in different ways from one another.</blockquote>

<p><br>Genuine thirdness requires an independent secondness and an independent
firstness, i.e. a genuine secondness that exists independently of genuine
thirdness, but all genuine secondness is not necessarily independent of
all thirdness ( ex:&nbsp;degenerate thirdness in the first degree ).
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdness it is
true involves Secondness and Firstness,&nbsp; in a sense. That is to say,
if you have the idea of Thirdness you must have had the ideas of Secondness
and Firstness to build upon. But what is required for the idea of a <b>genuine
Thirdness </b>is an <b>independent solid Secondness</b> and not a Secondness
that is a mere corollary of an unfounded and inconceivableThirdness. (EP2
p.177)</blockquote>

<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<p>But I may need to repeat that I am not trying to define
<br>the Categories of 1-ness, 2-ness, 3-ness, as I consider
<br>them to be primeval, primitive, undefined terms, and so,
<br>in a peculiar sense, already independent "in terms of"
<br>each other.&nbsp; Here, I am merely seeking to illustrate
<br>how I understand their application to sign-theoretic
<br>subject matter.&nbsp; It may help if I quote Chomsky again:
<p>| In linguistic theory, we face the problem of constructing
<br>| this system of levels in an abstract manner, in such a way
<br>| that a simple grammar will result when this complex of abstract
<br>| structures is given an interpretation in actual linguistic material.
<br>|
<br>| Since higher levels are not literally constructed out of lower ones,
<br>| in this view, we are quite free to construct levels of a high degree
<br>| interdependence, i.e., with heavy conditions of compatibility between
<br>| them, without the fear of circularity that has been so widely stressed
<br>| in recent theoretical work in lingustics.&nbsp; (Chomsky, LSOLT,
page 100).
<br>|
<br>| Noam Chomsky, 'The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory',
<br>| Based on a widely circulated manuscript dated 1955.
<br>| University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 1975.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p><br>Chomsky says "Since higher levels are not literally constructed
out of lower ones,, we don't need to fear circularity". But would you say
that thirdness (seen as a "level" ) is not constructed out of lower levels
( secondness, firstness)&nbsp;? The categories are hierachized, aren't
they?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>JA:&nbsp; Let me try to give a more straightforward
answer,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it strikes me on second reading that this
way
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of responding may appear evasive or even flippant.
<p>JA:&nbsp; It did not occur to me that anyone would take what I said
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a strict definition of anything, since
it was intended
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more as a way of building relations among
constructs that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are either primitive or else already sufficiently
defined.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, we already have a good enough
definition of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sign relation -- I personally consider
the one in L75
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be the most clear, detailed, explicit,
and formalized
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of them all -- and this defines all of the
roles O, S, I
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; simultaneously in relation to each other.&nbsp;
Moreover, the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; definition of the cartesian product, that
comes into the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; game as soon as we start to develop the theory
of signs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along extensional lines, and which is almost
inevitable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if we want to use sign relations as models
of empirical
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activities and natural forms of conduct, already
brings
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us the utilities of the various dimensional
projections.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my purpose here was more to elucidate or
rationalize
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Categories as aspects or facets of 3-adic
relations
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than it was to define them on any particular
foundation.

<br>|
<br>| Logic will here be defined as 'formal semiotic'.
<br>| A definition of a sign will be given which no more

<br>| part by part, during a lapse of time.&nbsp; Namely,
<br>| a sign is something, 'A', which brings something,

<br>| I also make a historical review of all the

<br>|

<br>|
<br>| Logic is 'formal semiotic'.&nbsp; A sign is something,

<br>| It is from this definition that I deduce the

<br>| and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will

<p>JM:&nbsp; The problem is that the definition only says
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the sign determines the interpretant.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It says nothing about the relation between
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the object and the sign, i.e., that
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the object determines the sign.
<p>Are you under the impression that objects determine signs?
<br>I will have to think about that.&nbsp; As you know, the proper
<br>reading of the definition, if ever we arrive at it, will
<br>depend on using the author's meanings for "correspondence"
<br>and for "determination", which CSP gives in full, and at
<br>length, needless to say, in many other prominent places.
<br>But I still read this definition as defining a relation
<br>among three roles of players or domains of components,
<br>and so defining all of them in relation to each other.</blockquote>

<p><br>Definition L.75 says
<br>- A (sign) determines B (interpretant)
<br>- A (sign) puts B (interpretant) in correspondence with C (object)
so that the correspondence between C and B is of the same sort of as that
between C and A.
<p>i.e. the sign determines the interpretant, which as a sign determines
other interpretants ...
<p>But to say that the correspondence between C and B&nbsp;is of the same
sort as that between C&nbsp;and A doesn't imply that there should be a
determination at all. If there is a determination of the sign by its object,
there will be a determination of the Interpretant by the object, which
is consistent with Peirce's later definitions where the object clearly
determines the sign:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>You write: "<i>Are you under the impression that objects determine signs?"</i>
<p>Jon, this is not just an impression...
<br>&nbsp;
<p><A HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/LIBRARY/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/LIBRARY/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm</A> :
<p>32 - v. 1905 - MS 283. p.125, 129, 131. The basis of Pragmaticism:
<blockquote>A Sign, on the other hand, just in so far as it fulfill the
function of a sign, and none other, perfectly conforms to the definition
of a medium of communication.<b> It is determined by the object</b>, but
in no other respect than goes to enable it to act upon the interpreting
quasi mind ; and the more perfectly it fulfill its function as a sign,
the less effect it has upon that quasi-mind other than that of determining
it as if the object itself had acted upon it.</blockquote>

<p><br>33 - 1906 - S.S. 196 - Letter to Lady Welby (Draft) dated "1906
March 9" .
<blockquote>I use the word "Sign" in the widest sense for any medium for
the communication or extension of a Form (or feature). Being medium, <b>it
is determined by something, called its Object,</b> and determines something,
called its Interpretant or Interpretand.</blockquote>

<p><br>34 - 1906 - C.P. 4-531 - Apology for pragmaticism .
<blockquote>First, an analysis of the essence of a sign, (stretching that
word to its widest limits, as anything witch, <b>being determined by an
object</b>, determines an interpretation to determination, through it,
by the same object), leads to a proof that every sign is determined by
its object,</blockquote>
35 - v, 1906 - C.P. 5-473 - Pragmatism .
<blockquote>[...] That thing which causes a sign as such is called the
object (according to the usage of speech, the "real", but more accurately,
the existent object) represented by the sign : the sign is <b>determined
to some species of correspondence with that object.</b>[...]</blockquote>
36 - v. 1906 - MS 292. Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism .
<blockquote>A sign may be defined as something (not necessarily existent)
which <b>is so determined by a second something called its Object</b> that
it will tend in its turn to determine a third something called its Interpretant</blockquote>

<p><br>If you find a sign not determined by its object, it will be a sign
only according to Peirce's earlier definitions of a sign, and it will not
be a sign according to Peirce's later definitions.
<br>So carefully choose your definitions.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<p>JM:&nbsp; Now you say that the sign relation is a cartesian product
&lt;O,S,I>?
<p>No, I say that a sign relation L is a subset of a cartesian product
OxSxI.
<br>At least, that is what I say on extensional days, which is most days
of late.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
OK, that is what I meant, then by asking what is S, O and I?. So the question
is: how do you choose them, since you are taking an extensional approach?
Do you list all possible signs?
<br>And once you have selected either O, S or I, how do you express the
idea that there are three determinations ( O -> S,&nbsp;&nbsp; S -> I,&nbsp;
O -> I ) ?
<p>Take for example a photograph with your picture on. The picture on the
photograph represents you, but you do not represent the picture on the
photograph. How do you express that mathematically?
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<br>JM:&nbsp; so you have three sets: O, S, and I and the cartesian product
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is O x S x I = {(o, s, i) | o is in O, s is
in S, i is in I}, i.e.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all possible combinations of elements from
each set, corresponding
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to "points in space" with coordinates (o,s,i)
or ordered triplets,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which you project on lines, planes --?
<p>Yes, that is a good description of the full product space OxSxI.
<br>A sign relation L, then, is a subset L c OxSxI.
<p>JM:&nbsp; But I believe that it is only begging the question:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what are S, O, and I?&nbsp; what are they
sets of?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and why should it matter at all?
<p>I do not understand.&nbsp; It is a form of description, no more.
<br>It is not meant to tell you why you should care about this
<br>or that sign relation.&nbsp; That is a matter for you to choose.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
see above
<p>Best
<p>JM
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>&nbsp;
<br>JM:&nbsp; Why not simply say as Peirce that when you have a triplet
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you have three pairs, and when you have a
pair you have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two units, no matter what the triplet is made
of?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does the relation have to be a sign relation?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and how do you translate into the cartesian
product
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that idea that O determines S, S determines
I,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and O determines I?
<p>Again, this is just a form of description.&nbsp; As it happens,
<br>and this is a very common tactic in mathematical practice,
<br>it is very useful to begin by weakening it, and simply to
<br>incorporate all subsets of such a space under a "nominal"
<br>title of sign relations, only coming back at the second
<br>or third pass to note that some of them qualify only in
<br>a "trivial" way.&nbsp; The properties that they have are the
<br>properties that they have.&nbsp; It is our job but to notice,
<br>to describe, and to articulate them, species by species,
<br>genus by genus, an so on.&nbsp; It is all very straightforward,
<br>well, in principle, at least.
