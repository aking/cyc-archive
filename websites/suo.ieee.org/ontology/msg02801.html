&gt; Taken together these rules do not cohere, though in isolation each might
&gt; seem reasonable. For example, the proposed rule eliminating quorum
&gt; requirements entirely does not cohere with a high seconding requirement of
&gt; five votes to apply to even technical objections.  (We could in principle
&gt; have votes in which only four people participated counted as valid, while
&gt; four people would not suffice to object to the result).

Hi Lee-

At first glance, I had some similar thoughts.  However, I realized that all 
three are truly separate aspects (however, the "seconding" and "objecting" 
numbers should be the same, see below).

-----------
On the "quorum" issue ...

I agree that "quorum" is not a factor in E-mail (correspondence-based) 
consensus-building because there is no sense of "being present" (everyone is 
presumed to be continuously present ... yes, some people may be on vacation, 
but ballots are typically 30 days ... we would presume that a participant 
must access their E-mail at least once every 30 days).

In correspondence-based standards committee processes (which is pretty much 
how many standards committees operated for the 100 years up until the mid to 
late 1990's), there is some minimum requirement of *responses* to letter 
ballots (an E-mail ballot is, in effect, a letter ballot).  Typically, the 
requirement is 50% ... this is one of the cases where Abstains count: the 
number of responses is Yes + No + Abstain.

I'd recommend that we require a minimum number of responses to E-mail 
(letter) ballots, say 50%.  We shouldn't call this a "quorum" because the 
term "quorum" can confuse people in this context.  We should call this 
something like "minimum number of ballot responses".

Using a "minimum number of ballot responses" serves the same purpose as a 
"quorum" in in-person meetings: it ensures that committee decisions were 
made by a "substantial" number of participants ("subtantial" might be 1/3, 
40%, 50%, 2/3, 3/4 ... the choice is a matter of opinion, each with 
different strengths and weaknesses).  For RR00, a default "quorum" is a 
majority, i.e., &gt;50%, but organizations may agree upon different numbers.

-----------
On a second (third, fourth, or fifth) ...

In RROO (Robert's Rules of Order), the purpose of a second is minimize the 
amount frivolous discussion (in terms of formal committee deliberations ... 
we can have as much "frivolous" discussion as we like outside the formal 
deliberation on the E-mail reflector).  Choosing the right level of support 
(i.e., choosing a number like 2 in RROO, or choosing 5 as Jim suggested) is 
a matter of opinion.  I really believe that Jim is correct in assessing the 
large amount of administrative work (which includes all of us volunteers) in 
formal votes and, possibly, subsequent ballot resolution.

I don't know if 5 is the right number, but it sounds reasonable to me.  
Although a formula can make it more complex, I'd like the number 5 (or 
whatever it is) to shrink if the number of voting members shrinks.  The 
minimum should be 2.

-----------
On an objection to votes by acclimation (as Jim phrased it: "does anyone 
object to ..." for minor issues from the Chair and consensus-building for 
the Technical Editor) ...
 
I'd like to peel apart several aspects of Jim's suggestions.  First, the 
primary purpose of voting by acclamation is to speed the process when there 
is overwhelming agreement (see my excerpt of RROO at the end of this 
E-mail).  In in-person meetings, this can be determined by lots of nodding 
heads ... harder to determine in E-mail discussion.  I believe three things 
are necessary to make this work:

        1.  The Chair needs to get a good sense that there are no 
objections.  I can't give any hard and fast rules, but it just comes from 
experience.  Maybe the Chair can give a preliminary message like "I'm not 
hearing any objections to such and such and I'd like to get a vote by 
acclamation".  FYI, Paul (who just ran the Chair's election) made a 
reasonable assumption on voting by acclamation because there was no opposing 
candidate.  FYI2, SUO members, too, made a reasonable request to have a 
formal vote (see below).

        2.  Contentious issues should not be voted on by acclamation.

        3.  Participants should be reasonable in their objections to votes 
by acclamation.  In other words, don't just presume grand conspiricies and 
evil intentions ... this only adds ill will, frustration, and loss of 
valuable time.  A simple "I object to the vote by acclamation.  I'd rather 
have a formal vote." is all that is necessary.  This (collabration and 
consensus-building in *this* group) is a learning experience for all us ... 
it may take a while for the Chair and the participants to get the right 
sense of things.  If you have insights on how the Chair might have misread 
the committee, then send your suggestions to the Chair directly ... no need 
to tie up E-mail reflector bandwidth.

The second half of this is consensus-building for the Technical Editor.  The 
TE can use several strategies for improving the document.  However, the most 
important feature of the TE's work is that (1) he make changes based on 
direction from the group, (2) he use his judgement to make suggestions, and 
(3) his work requires approval (e.g., every new formal draft) from the 
group.  In other words, there are a good number of "controls" over the TE's 
work.  I wouldn't want to constrain the TE's work to the 5-person rule 
because even one person's objections might make sense (see the notion of 
"consensus" at the end of this E-mail).  The role of the TE is to make 
educated guesses about the consensus of the Working Group ... like the 
Chair, he may make some mistakes, but please give him some leeway ... we are 
all trying to do this electronically, so there may be some miscues.

In conclusion, the 5-person objection rule (or whatever the number) is 
primarily a tool to help speed the adminstrative and consensus-building 
aspects of the committee (the Chair) ... not a vehicle to rush things 
through.  The number for objections should be the same number for 
"seconding" because an objection causes a formal vote, just like "seconding" 
does.  As I said above, I don't recommend the 5-person minimum for the TE's 
work since there are regular, formal votes to approve new drafts.

-----------
&gt; Is there some e-mail template that has worked elsehwere ("a best
&gt; practice")  that we can adopt?

The suggestions above are based on best/existing practices from ISO, IEC, 
NCITS, and IEEE standards committees.

These suggestions on "quorum" (actually, participation level) are based on 
existing formal ballot rules for many standards committees (ISO/IEC, NCITS, 
IEEE).

The suggestions on "acclamation" for the Chair are based on RROO in the 
section on "Voting by General Consent".  Here's an excerpt (from "The New 
Robert's Rules of Order", Barnes and Noble pocket edition, ISBN 
0-88029-972-X, pages 154-155):

        General Consent.  When the formality of motions and voting can be 
avoided in routine business and on questions of little importance, business 
can be handled with greater efficiency, the chair assuming general 
(unanimous) consent until someone objects.  General consent does not 
necessarily mean that every member is in facvor of the motion, but, knowing 
it is useless to oppose it or even to discuss it, the opposition simply 
acquiesces in the formality.  Thus, in the case of approving the minutes, 
the chair asks if there are any corrections.  If one is suggested, it is 
made.  When no correction is suggested, the chair says, "There being no 
corrections [or no further corrections] the minutes stand approved".  While 
routine and minor matters can be rapidly diposed of in this way, any time an 
objection is made promptly, the chair ignores what has been done even if he 
has announced the result, and requires a regular vote.

The suggestions on the TE's (using his judgement to assess objections, seek 
compromises, and build consensus) are the "common sense" one learns in that 
role ... as mentioned above, there are "controls" from the working group 
that make sure the WG gets what it wants ... the TE is an informed 
participant that helps with the editing tasks.  In ISO/IEC committees, as 
convener (a position similar to a Chair), one learns the "consensus" is the 
absence of sustained, substanial opposition ... that doesn't mean unanimous 
... it's a judgement call.  The TE's need to have a sense of "consensus" to 
direct their work.

I hope this helps.
