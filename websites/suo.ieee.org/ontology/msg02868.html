And by the way, my reasons for disliking the term "regular" for
formally defined concepts are related to my long-standing arguments
with Pat Hayes and Nicola Guarino about the differences between
natural languages and formal languages.

Pat has continually argued that there is little, if anything,
to be learned from natural language semantics that can be usefully
applied to formal systems of knowledge representation, while I have
maintained that NL semantics and formal knowledge representations
must ultimately start with the same vaguely defined concepts.

Pat has claimed that hierarchies of NL terms in WordNet, EDR, and
other terminological systems are irrelevant for kn. rep. and that
the work in "aligning" the WordNet concepts with the Cyc concepts
was a useless exercise that has no relevance to ontology.

On the contrary, I have argued that there is a continuum between
the "formal ontologies" used in databases, knowledge bases, and
systems like Cyc and the "terminological ontologies" used in WordNet
and EDR.  For definitions of these terms, see the glossary

   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/gloss.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/gloss.htm</A>

which is based on discussions that we had in the ANSI ontology
workshops during 1996 and 1997, with some more recent updates.

In his review of my KR book, Nicola has argued that I don't
present sufficiently formal definitions of all the terms in the
sample ontology given in the book.  I do give some axioms for
the basic terms, but I don't believe that a complete, formal
axiomatization is possible or even desirable.  The primary
reasons are given in Chapter 6 on Knowledge Soup, which includes
many examples such as the ones listed below.

These examples show that no single, uniform set of definitions
can be found for any of the most important concepts needed for
the ontology.  Even for mathematical concepts such as "set" and
"mereology", there are multiple axiomatizations, any of which
might be preferred for some applications.

Some people have suggested that we just "pick" one of the more
popular axiomatizations as the basis for SUMO (the SUO Merged
Ontology).  But any choice we pick is going to be wrong for
many applications.

For those reasons, I believe that a terminological ontology,
somewhat at the level of WordNet or EDR is valuable as an index
to the terms that are needed.  Instead of having a single collection
of axioms, I believe that the SUO or SUMO should contain a hierarchy
of selected theories, each of which is consistent internally but
possibly inconsistent with other theories in the same hierarchy.
WordNet, EDR, or similar terminological systems could be used
to index the theories and assist in finding one or more that
could be used in a particular application.

This approach is an attempt to formalize Wittgenstein's theory
of language games:  each theory in the hierarchy corresponds to
a particular "game", which could be played with the words or terms
in WordNet.  Each theory (i.e., game) represents one specialized
interpretation of the naturally occurring words.  I discuss
the relationship of this approach to NL semantics in the paper
on concepts in the lexicon:

   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/lexicon.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/lexicon.htm</A>

I plan to discuss these issues in more detail in my talk at the
ICCS'2001 conference at Stanford on Friday morning, Aug. 3.

Following is a repeat of my examples from the previous note,
which illustrate my point that no single set of axioms can be
assumed, even for the terms from science, mathematics, and
computer technology.

_____________________________________________________________________

&gt; As more accurate terms for describing the two kinds of concepts,
&gt; I would suggest "natural" and "technical".  Wittgenstein's point
&gt; was that *every* naturally occurring concept is irregular in the
&gt; above sense, and that the only terms that are not irregular are
&gt; the ones that have been artificially defined for a particular
&gt; technical purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; Even in science (including mathematics and computer technology)
&gt; most terms are "natural" or "irregular" except when they are
&gt; formally defined for a specific purpose, whose scope lasts
&gt; only for the duration of a single book, article, manual,
&gt; or computer program.
&gt; 
&gt; As examples, consider the terms "space" and "time" in ordinary
&gt; language, Newtonian mechanics, Einstein's relativity, and more
&gt; recent theories of cosmology.  People who have taken a course in
&gt; physics often equate Newtonian "absolute time" with "common sense",
&gt; but Newton himself had to argue against the "relativistic time",
&gt; which he believed was "common among the vulgar".  But what Newton
&gt; considered "vulgar" is today considered "advanced physics", and
&gt; most of the people in the world (considering the so called third
&gt; world nations as the majority) have concepts of time that are
&gt; very different from the ones that are "common sense" for people
&gt; who have grown up with clocks and schedules.
&gt; 
&gt; In mathematics, consider the concept of "number", whose definition
&gt; has gone through many twists and turns in mathematics books over the
&gt; past 2500 years and took even more radical twists and turns during
&gt; the 20th century, especially in the latter half with all of the many
&gt; different definitions that have cropped up in computer systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I was recently looking at a book about SQL (the O'Reilly book
&gt; _SQL in a Nutshell_), which included a comparison of the definitions
&gt; of datatypes (including numbers) in the SQL92 standard, the SQL99
&gt; standard, and four different implementations of SQL, none of which
&gt; exactly conformed to the definitions in either of the two "standards".
&gt; 
&gt; If physicists can't agree on a single definition of "space" and
&gt; "time" and mathematicians can't agree on a single definition
&gt; of "number", it is very difficult to imagine any concepts that
&gt; might be called "regular".
