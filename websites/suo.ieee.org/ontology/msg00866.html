SUO Working Group,

A misunderstanding has developed between
Phil Jackson and myself for which I have
already sent him a carte blanche apology
off-list.  Since the later stages of the
misunderstanding appear to me to involve
a tangle of factors that I cannot remedy,
traceable perhaps to misapperceptions of
the intentions behind certain manners of
expression to which diverse temperaments
are likely to resort, for which conducts
it would be an act of some hypocrisy for
me to apologize, since I do not know any
way that I might be able to gain control
over their ilk and thus be able to avoid
the occasions of their recurrence in the
future, it is incumbent on me to try and
root out at least the original causes of
the misunderstanding insofar as they lie
within some controlable error on my part.

Therefore I have gone over Phil's initial communique,
and I have found what I think to be my first mistake
in interpreting it, which I will mark below as a way
of exposing my sin against him and his epistle to us.

&gt; 
&gt; Phil,
&gt; 
&gt; Long time no see!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for helping me to pin down the locations
&gt; of some of the tenter-hooks that we are hung-up
&gt; and hanging-on here.
&gt; 
&gt; I will just interject, within your text,
&gt; the first things that come into my mind.

&gt; &gt; Jim, and all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once again I will jump into the fray with a few
&gt; &gt; comments and suggestions for how to proceed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that SUO has been making progress,
&gt; &gt; yet three central issues are unresolved:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) What are the objectives for use of the SUO?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2) What are the requirements for the SUO?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3) What are the requirements for the language(s)
&gt; &gt;    in which the SUO will be represented?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Before we can decide what language to use we
&gt; &gt; need to agree on the requirements for the language.
&gt; &gt; The requirements for the language depend on the
&gt; &gt; requirements for the SUO, which depend on the
&gt; &gt; objectives for the SUO.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Much of the discussion in SUO seems to involve these issues
&gt; &gt; while trying to make progress on theoretical questions related
&gt; &gt; to the SUO itself.  There needs to be a consensus on these issues
&gt; &gt; before people can agree about the value of any proposed candidate
&gt; &gt; for the SUO, or any proposed elements of an SUO, though efforts
&gt; &gt; such as Ian Niles' "merged ontology" are valuable at least
&gt; &gt; as strawmen to help identify issues.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The objectives of the SUO are addressed briefly at the SUO website,
&gt; &gt; in sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, though questions
&gt; &gt; still arise about the objectives.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in
&gt; &gt; the sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there
&gt; &gt; are questions that are unresolved about the requirements.
&gt; &gt; E.g. the Scope discussion says "an upper ontology is
&gt; &gt; limited to concepts that are meta, generic, abstract,
&gt; &gt; and philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether
&gt; &gt; the ontology should include "semiotic concepts" or should
&gt; &gt; only include things that "really exist" in the world.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~MARK~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

&gt; Okay, this seems to identify one of the main sticking points
&gt; for me personally, and I have only recently been able to get
&gt; enough of a pers-pective on it to barely begin to figure out
&gt; what the matter actually is.  It seems to be a bit like this:
&gt; 
&gt; When I initially began participating in the various threads that have been
&gt; more or less dedicated to "Semiotics Formalization" (SF), I did not at all
&gt; realize the difference in perspective that existed between me and the rest
&gt; of the participants who were apparently quite interested in the same topic.
&gt; In its critical points, as best I can see right now, after a long spell of
&gt; extremely puzzled reflection, the difference appears to be a bit like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  One POV (that I am now guessing is the outlook of most KIF^n Cousins,
&gt;     Parolees of La Logique FOLie, and other participants in this e-agora)
&gt;     views the whole divided subject-matter of semiology/semiotics as not
&gt;     a whit more than "yet another subject matter" (YASM) for rolling up
&gt;     in the Universal Wrapper of their favorite Logic, whether the Goodies
&gt;     be candied, cyclamated, diet, filled, "lite", NP-hard-or-soft-centered,
&gt;     saccharin, sugared, or whatever variety of confection they may confect
&gt;     to be wrapped-up in their bag.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  One POV (mine, perhaps other Perseans, byzantine, canonical, or otherwise)
&gt;     quite literally views this semeiotic/semitotic zygote, the homunculus of
&gt;     all future sense to be borne in time, as a more general subject than logic --
&gt;     though perhaps more "primitive", more "rudimentary", more "savage" (in the
&gt;     sense of 'La Pensée Sauvage' by Claude Levi-Strauss) would be better words
&gt;     to use for its relationship to what we think "in" and "of" as Formal Logic.
&gt;     In this light, this tool, or the brand of it that I personally prefer to
&gt;     call the "pragmatic theory of signs" (PTOS) is the prior instrument, the
&gt;     precursive methodology, the proto-organon that I use in order to study
&gt;     the more evolved dynamics and the more formalized implementations of
&gt;     logic itself, in whatever "language of the month" that it may happen,
&gt;     for the moment, to find itself flavored and wrapped up in. 
&gt; 
&gt; Have To Break Now,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~KRAM~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Okay, what is now rather abundantly clear to me
on my second reading of the following paragraph
is that -- well, not desiring to be attributing
intentions to another, I have to say that it is
only my next hypothesis -- that Phil's comments
about semiosis are not really intended to raise
that subject as a topic for discussion but only
to set it down as one of many possible examples
that might be adduced to illustrate his mediate
concern with a number of more procedural issues,
and so it was only my overriding interest, even
obsession, with this single substantive subject
that led me to run rough shod over the intended
purpose of his note.  This, of course, was very
insensitive, and quite out of keeping with that
brand of regard that has become the hallmark of
our discussions here.  And the instance of such
a behavior, on my part, is something that I can
say that I genuinely regret.  I shall take more
care with that aspect of my conduct from now on.

&gt; &gt; Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in
&gt; &gt; the sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there
&gt; &gt; are questions that are unresolved about the requirements.
&gt; &gt; E.g. the Scope discussion says "an upper ontology is
&gt; &gt; limited to concepts that are meta, generic, abstract,
&gt; &gt; and philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether
&gt; &gt; the ontology should include "semiotic concepts" or should
&gt; &gt; only include things that "really exist" in the world.

Sincerely Yours,

Jon Awbrey
