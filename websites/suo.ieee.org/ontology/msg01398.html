Dear John,


&gt; We ought to be very careful about identifying mutually 
&gt; exclusive options,
&gt; especially, very wary of POV's that present themselves as Either-Or's
&gt; whenever it is conceivable they merely gloss different facets of the
&gt; same object, subject, topic, or whatever, as this has been one of
&gt; the places, historically and hysterically speaking, where we have
&gt; wasted the most time, that is, assuming that at least some of it
&gt; could have been avoided, which is a good question for such as us.

MW: A good point worth clarifying. In my view a choice is required just when
failure to make a choice leads to a logical contradiction, and that is the
test 
I would be looking for (at least as a starting position). Choices of course
only
apply within a particular point of view.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It occurs to me that some may be a little confused about
&gt; &gt; what all the fuss is about.  There has been a very lively
&gt; &gt; discussion about how we should construct an SUO, with a large
&gt; &gt; number of sub-plots, the result being that you could be forgiven
&gt; &gt; for being confused about what the discussion is actually about.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This at least is my version.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are a number (say about 4-5) of world views that are 
&gt; documented,
&gt; &gt; either in natural language, or in a more formal form, with a number
&gt; &gt; of possible variations on these.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ian and his supporters argue that because all philosophers 
&gt; do not agree
&gt; &gt; on just one of these, we should ignore all of them, giving 
&gt; preference
&gt; &gt; to a process that Ian might describe as pragmatic selection from
&gt; &gt; various sources and merge.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I, Pat Hayes, John Sowa, Chris Partridge, Nicola Guarino (please
&gt; &gt; correct me if I am mistaken) and perhaps others would argue that we
&gt; &gt; would be better served by understanding the existing World 
&gt; Viewpoints
&gt; &gt; and relating them to each other.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Discussion
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As far as I can see there are four possible outcomes to 
&gt; Ian's approach.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Ian solves the problem that previous philosophers have 
&gt; failed to solve
&gt; &gt;    and creates a single ontology that everyone agrees is 
&gt; how the world is.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Ian recreates one of the possibilities that are already 
&gt; known about.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. Ian creates a new ontology with a different world 
&gt; viewpoint than those
&gt; &gt;    already existing, adding one more to the list that 
&gt; philosophers don't
&gt; &gt;    agree about.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. Ian fails to create a consistent ontology.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let us consider these in turn:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Included for completeness only. I don't think Ian 
&gt; expects this outcome.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. One of the two most likely outcomes, in which case it 
&gt; would be more
&gt; &gt;    efficient to do some homework and make an informed 
&gt; choice (or adopt
&gt; &gt;    the counter position above).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. A remote possibility, and probably the least useful.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. The most likely short term result, based on what I read
&gt; &gt;    and my own experience, getting to a consistent universal
&gt; &gt;    ontology from scratch takes some 5-10+ years work -- for
&gt; &gt;    those few who can claim some measure of success.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The alternative approach:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - Recognises that there are a (small) number of major world
&gt; &gt;    viewpoints that exist and are valid (within some range).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Tries to understand explicitly what are the elements
&gt; &gt;    that underpin those viewpoints and the applicable range.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Identifies key choices that are mutually exclusive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Documents those viewpoints based on that understanding.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Enables interoperation between those viewpoints
&gt; &gt;    by mapping between them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We could of course pursue both of these options.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Comments?

&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for this very succinct and thoughtful prognosis!
&gt; The only thing that comes to mind right off the bat that
&gt; I might even think to add would be something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; By way of pursuing the element of your alternative that:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Identifies key choices that are mutually exclusive.
&gt; 
&gt; We ought to be very careful about identifying mutually 
&gt; exclusive options,
&gt; especially, very wary of POV's that present themselves as Either-Or's
&gt; whenever it is conceivable they merely gloss different facets of the
&gt; same object, subject, topic, or whatever, as this has been one of
&gt; the places, historically and hysterically speaking, where we have
&gt; wasted the most time, that is, assuming that at least some of it
&gt; could have been avoided, which is a good question for such as us.
&gt; 
&gt; We should not confound this care, this wariness, this welcome 
&gt; to synthesis,
&gt; with the various pretences to ecumenical tolerance that are 
&gt; often preached,
&gt; but as seldom practiced, for it is very decidedly different 
&gt; than even that.
&gt; In my experience, these unmelting "pretences of tolerance" 
&gt; (POT's) are just
&gt; as bad, if not worse, because they set up a situation that 
&gt; says, in effect:
&gt; "All POV's (in a standarized set) are welcome, but everyone 
&gt; has to chosse."
&gt; The combination of the "All" with what is "covered" by the 
&gt; parenthesis is
&gt; really just a shabbily disguised totalitarian stance, and a 
&gt; corresponding
&gt; attempt to distort reality to fit.  Somehow, we always tend 
&gt; to forget --
&gt; because it may just be that Nature does not give a tinker's 
&gt; damn about our
&gt; pretences to "mutually exclusive", and now implicitly 
&gt; "exhaustive", options.
&gt; 
&gt; I have passed through fields that were positivistically rife with
&gt; that pretentious prefix "anti-" and that insufferable suffix "-ism",
&gt; which, after the fashion of their rich relation "meta", have become
&gt; so habituated with prolonged use that they have not only lost almost
&gt; all of their erstwhile senses but appear to render the users thereof
&gt; positivistically dopey.  And even though folks have been taught that
&gt; they are 'sposed to act nice toward their infidel neighbors, somehow
&gt; there preveils this under-stated tenet that only a morally corrupt
&gt; and a thoroughly debased person would "refuse to choose" between
&gt; what every righteous and true and serially faithful person can
&gt; fathom to be "mutually exclusive, tacitly exhaustive" (METE):
&gt; 
&gt; " Either ' essentialism'  ' Or ' existentialism ' "
&gt; " Either ' empiricism     ' Or ' rationalism    ' "
&gt; " Either ' behaviorism    ' Or ' cognitivism    ' "
&gt; " Either ' idealism       ' Or ' realism        ' "
&gt; " Either ' absolutism     ' Or ' relativism     ' "
&gt; " Either ' objectivism    ' Or ' coherentism    ' "
&gt; " Either ' extensionalism ' Or ' intensionalism ' "
&gt; " Either ' logicism       ' Or ' psychologism   ' "
&gt; " Either ' denotatism     ' Or ' connotatism    ' "
&gt; " Either ' formalism      ' Or ' intuitionism   ' "
&gt; " Either ' modalism       ' Or ' nodalism       ' "
&gt; " Either ' atomism        ' Or ' etherism       ' "
&gt; " Either ' ...            ' Or ' ...            ' "
&gt; 
&gt; If you are beginning to get the picture that maybe, just maybe,
&gt; the implicit form is more important than the explicit contents,
&gt; that the ultimate invariant message is hidden on the bare face
&gt; of the medium that bears these shifting and variable instances,
&gt; well, then you are beginning to get the same picture that I got,
&gt; that it is really this stricture of the "Either'_'Or'_'" that is
&gt; designed to get itself eternally and recurringly transmitted here,
&gt; that is conating and conspiring to deliver and to render itself now,
&gt; like some entelechial virus, immortally and perpetually communicable.
&gt; 
&gt; And so far it seems to be working ...
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
