Dear Pat,

&gt; 
&gt; What 
&gt; worries me is that some of the pragmatic enthusiasts of 
&gt; standardization have a very oversimplified vision of what the 
&gt; problems are, and that they therefore are being led (or allowed) to 
&gt; expect a lot more from the SUO than it can possibly deliver to them. 
&gt; If someone thinks of this as being like the choice of a standard 
&gt; book-cataloging scheme, or a standard math notation, or a standard 
&gt; paper size, then they really havnt understood what ontologies *are*.

MW: I think this is the real concern. I think you are right that some people
here think we are going to make progress relatively quickly (a year or two).
Whilst I hope we will achieve something in a couple of years, the most
likely result in that timescale is a better understanding of the size of
problem we face.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hi Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I seem to have struck a raw nerve.
&gt; 
&gt; Nah, I just expressed myself a little too colorfully.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have just got back to the raft of messages my original 
&gt; email seems to have
&gt; &gt;provoked.
&gt; &gt;I have looked through them and I think that there may be some
&gt; &gt;misunderstandings, which I will try to clarify.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You wrote:
&gt; &gt;There is an alternative conclusion, which is that alternative ways of
&gt; &gt;thinking about a topic might all be equally valid and coherent, even
&gt; &gt;though they differ from one another. The proposal to find a single
&gt; &gt;coherent upper-level ontology then amounts to an insistence that all
&gt; &gt;but one of these alternative ways of thinking are wrong. This is a
&gt; &gt;kind of intellectual fascism which has never succeeded in the past
&gt; &gt;several thousand years, and is unlikely to make progress now either.
&gt; &gt;Maybe the SUO should focus on ways of allowing alternative
&gt; &gt;conceptions of the world to co-exist, rather than trying to legislate
&gt; &gt;which of them is 'right'. That approach would at least have the merit
&gt; &gt;of providing a standard that more than a small fraction of the user
&gt; &gt;base could use without discomfort.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I do not see how 'The proposal to find a single coherent upper-level
&gt; &gt;ontology then amounts to an insistence that all but one of 
&gt; these alternative
&gt; &gt;ways of thinking are wrong.' Any more than arguing that a 
&gt; law that says we
&gt; &gt;drive on the right side of the road, says that driving on 
&gt; the left side is
&gt; &gt;inherently wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; "wrong" was too simplistic. I didnt mean inherently wrong, I meant 
&gt; more like 'one of these sides will be chosen by fiat, and the others 
&gt; thereby forbidden.' Which wouldnt matter if the choice were 
&gt; arbitrary, but it isn't. So a better analogy might be a law which 
&gt; insisted that one drive only at a precise speed while holding the 
&gt; wheel with ones right hand, or some such.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It seems to me that there are a number of possible different 
&gt; enterprises
&gt; &gt;here, let me characterise them as:
&gt; &gt;-	philosophical,
&gt; &gt;-	scientific/engineering, and
&gt; &gt;-	everyday.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It is true that the goal of some attempts in philosophy is 
&gt; to arrive at a
&gt; &gt;'right' answer - and that they have failed. Indeed some 
&gt; philosophers think
&gt; &gt;in terms of the current best effort (e.g. David Lewis 
&gt; justifying his views
&gt; &gt;on possible worlds.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The history of science sets us a different example. It seems 
&gt; that what
&gt; &gt;happens (according to Kuhn et al) that the development of 
&gt; science requires
&gt; &gt;the choice of a framework (what he calls a paradigm). An 
&gt; example might be
&gt; &gt;Newton's choice of absolute space. These frameworks are essential for
&gt; &gt;progress - if the lessons of the last few thousand years - 
&gt; and particularly
&gt; &gt;the last five hundred years - are anything to go by.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As these historians and philosophers of science have pointed 
&gt; out, choosing
&gt; &gt;the framework is as much a political as a rational process, 
&gt; and involves
&gt; &gt;persuading the community that the framework is the 'right' 
&gt; one. Typically it
&gt; &gt;involves a choice between several competing theories. 
&gt; Furthermore this is
&gt; &gt;only ever successful if the framework is sufficiently good 
&gt; (where this is
&gt; &gt;characterised in a number of ways). I'm not sure how this 
&gt; qualifies as
&gt; &gt;intellectual fascism.
&gt; 
&gt; That doesnt, but (1) scientific theories are not chosen by standards 
&gt; organizations (fortunately), and if they were then it could be so 
&gt; described, so your metaphor here is misleading; but more to the point 
&gt; (2) there in fact isnt a single *ontological* framework in science, 
&gt; and it couldnt possibly be done if there were. Scientists re-think 
&gt; their ontologies constantly, without changing their basic Kuhnian 
&gt; paradigm. Interestingly enough, the RKF effort is working through 
&gt; some genuine sceince in the form of a biology textbook, and one finds 
&gt; alternative (and conflicting) ontological presumptions all the time, 
&gt; sometimes in the same sentence. We all know what DNA actually is; but 
&gt; should we think of (formalize) it as a tube, a spiral, a molecule, a 
&gt; linked structure of atoms, a series of pairs, a pair of sequences, or 
&gt; as a genetic 'sentence' in base-pair code? The text dances between 
&gt; these alternative views without even noticing the ontological shifts 
&gt; involved, since human beings can make those ontological shifts 
&gt; without effort; but ontologies can't. (Well, not with current 
&gt; technology; but to make this possible would be a significant advance 
&gt; in AI, not just a standard ontology. The RKF effort might finish up 
&gt; using explicit metaphorical mappings, for example, to allow several 
&gt; logically incompatible ontologies to co-exist.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If we look at everyday uses of the concepts dealt with by 
&gt; philosophy and
&gt; &gt;science, then here there is a plethora of theories - and 
&gt; probably always
&gt; &gt;will be. So adopting a 'standard' in one field of work does 
&gt; not eliminate
&gt; &gt;variety in others.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You wrote (in a subsequent email):
&gt; &gt;'However, I honestly cannot reconcile what you say with what 
&gt; Chris says.
&gt; &gt;What is "the ontological paradigm" if it is not the One True 
&gt; Ontology?'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;An ontological paradigm would be the one accepted ontology - 
&gt; but like all
&gt; &gt;science subject to both evolution and revolution.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My concern is that the work involved in producing a single 
&gt; coherent general
&gt; &gt;theory is enormous. I suspect that this is way beyond the 
&gt; resources of the
&gt; &gt;SUO (hence my vote at set up was ABSTAIN). If no real effort 
&gt; is made to
&gt; &gt;produce a high level then the work is surely doomed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My guess is that science's method of working (with a single 
&gt; framework) is
&gt; &gt;because the cost of working with a variety of frameworks is 
&gt; astronomic. As
&gt; &gt;philosophy has shown the high level 'concepts' are 
&gt; inter-related and working
&gt; &gt;out these for each of the choices on each of the topics is a really
&gt; &gt;substantial piece of work - especially given that there are 
&gt; not really any
&gt; &gt;coherent theories covering the full range.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds to me like you are thinking of the alternatives as all 
&gt; fitting into some kind of super-heirarchy. As I tried to argue in a 
&gt; previous message, they don't really do so ('really' because they 
&gt; could be forced into one, but its upper levels would then just be a 
&gt; kind of philosophical catalog of alternative metaphysical stances, 
&gt; rather than any kind of unified upper ontology in the sense I think 
&gt; y'all have in mind.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;My concern is very different from yours - and it focusses on 
&gt; a different
&gt; &gt;domain/purpose. Enterprises are finding that they need to 
&gt; link together
&gt; &gt;systems, and the biggest problem they are having is at the 
&gt; semantic level
&gt; &gt;(Mike Uschold pointed this out in an earlier email). They 
&gt; are going to
&gt; &gt;develop something to do this - unless someone introduces 
&gt; them to the work
&gt; &gt;done by philosophers et al. (and the fact that there are a range of
&gt; &gt;choices - and how these choices interlink) we are going to 
&gt; end up with a
&gt; &gt;standard that is unaware of the substantial issues and alternatives.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand your pragmatic point, and even sympathise with it.  What 
&gt; worries me is that some of the pragmatic enthusiasts of 
&gt; standardization have a very oversimplified vision of what the 
&gt; problems are, and that they therefore are being led (or allowed) to 
&gt; expect a lot more from the SUO than it can possibly deliver to them. 
&gt; If someone thinks of this as being like the choice of a standard 
&gt; book-cataloging scheme, or a standard math notation, or a standard 
&gt; paper size, then they really havnt understood what ontologies *are*.
