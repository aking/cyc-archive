Matthew, 
	.	Do we need to "select" documents at this early stage at all?
If so, why? 

	.	I say this because there seems to be much misgiving about
each of them so far, indicating to me that no-one can be confident about the
soundness and robustness of any of them yet. 

	.	Why not just let them develop until a fair degree of
consensus starts emerging that some of them have sound structures? Isn't
that the time to vote on granting a more formal status? 

	.	Regardless of your observations about peoples' reasons for
objecting, the inability of many to have confidence in any of the documents
so far, is the reason I supported revocation of the poll. 

	.	Furthermore, if all candidate documents are posted, surely
they will thrive or die in terms of the correspondence they generate.  

	.	These are my reasons for asking you the questions above.

Dear Jim,

First, thank you for recognising the position and acting accordingly.

&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I now count 5 additional objections to past actions 
&gt; (total 7), which
&gt; is more than enough to declare that the 'Proposed Conclusions 
&gt; to the Straw
&gt; Poll' do not stand.  I am considering these objections to 
&gt; still be timely
&gt; since this matter has obviously remained open this entire time.

MW: I support your decision. To do otherwise could leave a mess, or worse
a vote that is carried but does not have real support.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Ian and Adam are free to propose again if they wish.  

MW: I agree. I would respectfully suggest they consider withdrawing their
motion, at least until the proposal Robert is developing has been discussed.
If that is proposed and accepted, Adam and Ian will merely have to propose
the Merged Ontology, rather than ask for a vote. Which I hope should leave
everyone happy. (unless the motivation for a vote was what I described as
Type (2) which should be dealt with separately).

&gt; We can now
&gt; conduct an official vote.  Under Robert's Rules (still 
&gt; unclear the degree
&gt; these apply to email votes), a motion needs just one 'second' 
&gt; to be put to a
&gt; vote.  I suggest a greater number should be required and will 
&gt; propose such a
&gt; clause tonight. 

MW: I'm not so bothered about votes being called, as the time for voting. If
votes are to happen in a reasonable time then we probably need to put time
limits between call for vote and count of votes such that any votes not cast
in that time frame are deemed to be abstentions. All of this subject to
delay by points of order etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Please understand that with only 2 objections to adopting the
&gt; 'Proposed Conclusions,'  I felt it was the fairest decision 
&gt; to adopt them.

MW: I have felt quite confident of your intentions. Your actions here
confirm that confidence.

&gt; With 7 current objections, it now is clear we should not.  
&gt; 
&gt;  I believe we will eventually learn that an email group 
&gt; cannot function if a
&gt; small number of objections can force votes.  I doubt we would 
&gt; have ever
&gt; completed the Scope and Purpose if this was the rule.   As I 
&gt; said, I will
&gt; propose a clause this evening addressing this issue.

MW: Well there are different reasons for objecting. Sometimes it is so that
peoples position must go on record, but that is usually for political
matters.

MW: I think that any objection should give rise to discussion, it may be
that
issues can be resolved, and a new consensus can be achieved. If we have to
make
a hard choice where there really are two routes and we have to choose one,
then
a vote probably is appropriate. On the other hand it seems to me reasonable
that we might require say 2 objections to force a vote (as there are
required 2 to propose something in the first place). However, the key thing
here is that we all have to know what the rules in play are, and changing
the rules has been one of the biggest problems here. On the whole I would
leave Robert's Rules alone unless there is obvious evidence of abuse of
process, which I don't think we have had yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Schoening  
&gt; 

Regards  
      Matthew
