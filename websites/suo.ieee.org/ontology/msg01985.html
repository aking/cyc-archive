Jon,

There is a serious problem whose implications have great
pragmatic significance for the SUO, the semantic web, and,
in general, any computer system that uses multiple languages
and must be able to translate messages from one to another:
 
 1. What does it mean to say that distinct sentence types
    in one or more languages (natural languages, programming
    languages, versions of logic, or whatever) can be said to
    "express the same meaning"?

 2. How can we formulate an answer to that question in a way
    that is effectively computable, at least for the more
    formalized of those languages?

 3. Some logicians have proposed some answers, but they have
    glaring deficiencies.  Richard Montague, for example,
    defined the intension of a sentence to be a function from
    possible worlds to truth values.  Some problems with that
    definition:

    a) All theorems of mathematics and anything else that is
       true by definition would turn out to have exactly the
       same "intension", since they are true in all possible
       worlds.

    b) For the purpose of the SUO, one would hope that the
       axioms and definitions would be true in quite a few,
       if not all possible worlds, and Montague's definition
       would not be able to distinguish much, if any difference
       in "meaning" among any of them.

    c) Possible worlds are very difficult to reach by any
       commercial transportation service, but provability
       can be used instead:  two sentences that are provably
       equivalent must be true in all possible worlds.
       However, provability in general is NP-complete, and
       the algorithms would take exponential time to verify. 

Problem to be solved:  Consider the informal definition of
"proposition" as "the meaning of a sentence".  And find some
suitable formal definition, which at least for formalized
languages is efficently computable and able to distinguish
finer differences of meaning than Montague's approach.
Certainly, "2+2=4" should not have the same "meaning" or
"intension" as Fermat's last theorem.  Even "2+3=5" should be
considered distinct from "2+2=4".

&gt;Yes, but, er, if your patent formulations did not compare
&gt;in some favorable way with what is ordinarily understood
&gt;by the words "meaning" and "proposition",

First of all, there is no well-defined "ordinarily understood"
definition of those terms.  The definition that I proposed
makes finer distinctions than Montague's, it distinguishes
"2+2=4" from "2+3=5", and it can be computed in linear or
nearly linear time.  And, most importantly, it corresponds
rather closely to informal intuitions about differences
of meaning.

&gt; or unless you
&gt;are able to give some account of these concepts that is
&gt;independent of formal symbolic manipulations, then it
&gt;appears that you are already bound to charge yourself
&gt;with the fault that -- how did you put it when you
&gt;consigned my calculus to the Frege-Russell line? --
&gt;"treats the rules of [translation] as primitives that
&gt;are not justified by their effects on truth conditions",
&gt;thus infringing the definition and the horizon of logic
&gt;as "the formal conditions for the truth of representations",
&gt;in effect, reversing the bias that is more usual of buying the
&gt;emphasis "formal" at the expense of "truth" and "representation".

To be formal, it is essential to define the procedure in terms
of syntactic operations.  My criticism of Frege was not that
he used syntactic operations.  That is also what Peirce, Tarski,
and everyone else does.  The difference is that everyone from
Aristotle to Peirce and Tarski recognized that the ultimate
justification for those syntactic operations is their
connection with the universe of discourse to which the
vocabulary and indexicals of the language refer.

The four criteria for a meaning-preserving translation (MPT)
have the following justification:

 1. Invertible:  If sentence s is mapped to another sentence
    f(s), which is said to have the same meaning, then it should
    also be possible to map f(s) back to another sentence that
    has "the same meaning".

 2. Proof preserving:  The rules of inference in each language
    under consideration must be justified by truth conditions,
    in the sense of everybody from Aristotle to Peirce and
    Tarski.  Therefore, the syntactic operations on proofs
    have a direct link to corresponding semantic operations.
    
 3. Vocabulary preserving:  The content words of any language
    must be linked to the universe of discourse by triadic
    sign relations.  Therefore, preserving the vocabulary is
    a prerequisite to preserving the referential connections.

 4. Structure preserving:  By structure, I mean the minimal
    logical form preserved by Peirce's EGs (existence,
    conjunction, and negation).  Existence is much simpler
    and easier to verify pragmatically than the universal
    quantifier, conjunction is pragmatically the least
    controversial of all the Boolean operators, and negation
    is essential to support at least FOL.  Peirce gave many,
    many pragmatic discussions of the interpretation of
    negations in his graphs, and his arguments can be assumed
    for this purpose.

These four conditions can be verified by purely syntactic
tests, but each of them is justified by pragmatic reasons.

Another important point:  although my condition #2 is the
same as Montague's, condition #4 of structure preserving
makes the proofs almost trivial:  any two statements that
have the same structure by #4 can be tested for equivalence
in linear or nearly linear time.

&gt;1.  I regard the meaning of a sign or expression to be:
&gt; 
&gt;    a.  its denotation  (= object, referent, bedeutung).
&gt;    b.  its connotation (= interpretant, sense, sinn).
&gt;    c.  either of the above.
&gt;    d.  none of the above.
&gt;    e.  other (go to essay section).
&gt;
&gt;2.  I regard a proposition, in use, not mention, to be:
&gt;
&gt;    a.  a sign (= expression, sentence), either token or type,
&gt;               not excluding the interpretants of other signs.
&gt;    b.  an object, either abstract or concrete, token or type,
&gt;               just for example, the denotation of a sentence.
&gt;    c.  either of the above.
&gt;    d.  none of the above.
&gt;    e.  other (go to essay section).

Yes, we agree on those points.

&gt;I have gone back to your definitions and read them again,
&gt;and I am still confused about how I should understand your
&gt;use of the words "meaning" and "proposition".  Perhaps it
&gt;was that use of Peirce's statement about propositions,
&gt;which I still cannot read as referring to anything else
&gt;but propositional expressions as a class of signs.

That is exactly what I said: "Peirce's informal statement may
be formalized by defining a proposition as an equivalence
class of sentences that can be translated from one to another
while preserving meaning."   Then I stated four conditions
for what I would call a "meaning-preserving translation".

In effect, Montague's equivalence classes correspond to
a definition of MPT that uses only the first two criteria:
invertible and proof preserving.  The criteria of vocabulary
preserving and structure preserving make finer distinctions.
Furthermore, they can be computed much more efficiently than
the criterion of proof preserving on arbitrary sentences.
