&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim, 
&gt; 	.	This has turned into a suggested set of 
&gt; alterations to the SUO group methods of working. I
&gt; believe these are pragmatic ways of overcoming the
&gt; recent hiatus that has obstructed our  progress. 
&gt; You may like to consider the approaches suggested
&gt; below as ways of  improving the SUO development
&gt; process. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew et al, 
&gt; 	.		I will provide a brief note, in 
&gt; numerical order, on each of the 3 e-mails below: 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	RE: #3 "Flawed Approach: So long as Ian Niles
&gt; is co-ordinating (and actually doing) the work, I suggest the 
&gt; structure of the basis is, de facto, under his control, taking
&gt; into account the input from the rest of us. If we get to a stage
&gt; where someone actually suggests a different structure
&gt; (absolute silence so far .......), and Ian rejects it on
&gt; a basis the majority of us disagree with, then this issue 
&gt; could be worth revisiting. 

MW: I think what I have been proposing as a set of deliverables is an
alternative approach that in particular involves putting the horses in front
of the cart.

&gt; 
&gt; 	.	At present, Ian is showing worthwhile effort, 
&gt; and is genuinely adapting participants comments in a
&gt; reasonable way, including taking note when there is
&gt; reaction to solution paths he has developed in the
&gt; absence of guidance or when he has attempted to
&gt; rationalise things himself. 

MW: I am the last to denigrate Ian's effort. At a minimum it has raised the
issues we are now discussing. One of my own mottos is "if in doubt do
something", and Ian has, and as a result we have much useful evidence of
what we need to do.

GH&gt;	Problem is that others are using such aspects as your comments as
grounds to try to undo his work. 

&gt; 	.	An important aspect that Ian should
&gt; continue to do, is advising the group of every change
&gt; that he makes on his own  initiative, so that their
&gt; merits can be considered in the light of the breadth of
&gt; experience of the other group members. 

&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	I propose that Ian Niles be accepted as the 
&gt; co-ordinator and developer of the SUO content, on the
&gt; basis that no-one else is proposing or
&gt; offering to undertake the work. 

MW: This is a de facto situation for the work Ian is doing.

GH&gt;	Of course, and I'd like to give it some formal recognition. 

&gt; 	.	I further propose that the SUO content
&gt; co-ordinator and developer be required to advise the
&gt; group of every change that s/he makes on their own
&gt; initiative, so that the merits of each such change can be
&gt; considered by the other group members. 

MW: It would be nice to have a way of marking changes without having to work
your way right through the document each time. 

GH&gt;	True. He has been explaining more in recent times, and perhaps this
proposal will encourage even more such commentary. 

&gt; 	.	RE: #4 'Practical Purpose': I have
&gt; addressed the issue of potential alternative start points
&gt; several times recently. Only one alternative has so far
&gt; even been registered, but, so far, no-one is prepared
&gt; to champion even that. We're quite prepared to
&gt; consider any suggestions on their merits.

MW: And I suspect that is not the work we have done in EPISTLE which I have
mentioned several times, but continues to be totally ignored. 

GH&gt;	I admit I vaguely recall that, and I think you'll find I have taken
up the issue of building on pre-existing ontologies on and off for some
time, I don't think ever suggesting it was my idea, because I don't think it
was. I have been working on the principle that things need to be raised
again from time to time, especially where there is no response. 

&gt; 	.	Since you evidently feel "that what we 
&gt; currently have is too far from something that would be
&gt; an acceptable standard, that it does not constitute a
&gt; start point", what do you suggest as the alternative????
&gt; Numbers of us are eagerly waiting to actually hear a
&gt; positive option rather than just another criticism. 
&gt;Matthew, the ball is in your court!!

MW: In EPISTLE we have a top level (upper upper) 4D ontology. It is
currently being edited to be issued as a Draft International Standard by
ISO, so it is somewhat further forward and more coherent than our fumblings
here. Unfortunately, it is written in an entity relationship language called
EXPRESS (never mind that this is already an ISO standard) and is long on
structure and short on axioms. I have translated part of this into KIF
around the beginning of November. This is very difficult for me. As I am
sure you are aware, writing well in a language for a newcomer is much harder
than reading. It was anyway largely ignored, and now appears to be forgotten
as well, but please do not accuse me of not proposing something more solid. 

GH&gt;	I am working on the premise that, when Jim called for the vote, that
it doesn't consider previous proposals. Hence, if you still believe the
option has merit, I'd encourage you to re-state it, possibly pointing out
that you proposed it before. You may note that I have today called for all
pre-existing ontologies to be reviewed for relevance, etc., as part of the
project anyway. 

&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	(None was provided by Matthew) I propose
&gt; that the current development work by Ian Niles be
&gt; continued until someone actually proposes a viable
&gt; alternative. 

MW: No it is just forgotten, see above. 

GH&gt;	Well, not in the e-mail to which I was responding. 

&gt; 	.	RE: #5 'Email Process': I agree about the 
&gt; resourcing problem with the more usual standards
&gt; development approach you mention. Another
&gt; issue is that it is necessarily far slower than other 
&gt; approaches are capable of being - that's one of the
&gt; reasons the Internet is being taken up as a
&gt; mean of facilitating and expediting work. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	In regard to your final comment that: 
&gt; "We could make the e-mail stuff work better than it
&gt; does", I wish to suggest an  oft used and
&gt; well proven approach, including in standards development. 
&gt; This is that each comment include a "proposed solution".
&gt; This works best when the proposed solution provides
&gt; actual suggested alternative content that can be readily
&gt; assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I suggest that, if this approach is undertaken, 
&gt; then we will make far better and faster progress.  
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	I propose that all future comments on the SUO 
&gt; development each include a "proposed solution". As far as
&gt; possible, the proposed solution is to provide actual suggested
&gt; alternative content that can be readily assessed for its
&gt; effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem.
&gt; Comments that do not do this will not be ignored, but their 
&gt; adoption cannot be achieved until a satisfactory proposed
&gt; solution has been identified and accepted. 

MW: So you are suggesting that only hens can tell bad eggs? 

GH&gt;	I admit I hadn't looked at it that way. Nevertheless, if you
consider the full paragraph, you'll see that it provides a paradigm for
accommodating problems being raised without solutions. 

GH&gt;	You are making me realise that something I should have proposed is
an impact statement requiring contributors to spell out the sorts of
problems arising in explicit detail (eg. by example, so they are more than
idealistic wish-to-haves.

&gt; &gt; Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat
&gt; &gt; and John say - is not sufficiently conceptually consistent
&gt; &gt; as a basis and - as Matthew says - does
&gt; &gt; not seem to be ready for practical use.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that - as it stands - the Ontology is not 
&gt; &gt; really a standard that is fit for any practical purpose.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of 
&gt; &gt; making concrete suggestions via email is adequate for
&gt; &gt; the task at hand. A point that a
&gt; &gt; number of people have made in the past.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete 
&gt; &gt; suggestion for a way to produce an adequate product. 
&gt; &gt; I think the task is of a size  that anything I would suggest
&gt; &gt; would involve the old standards such as a project with
&gt; &gt; resources and a plan that gave some substance to the
&gt; &gt; process of analysis to be followed and the deliverables. 
&gt; &gt; But there is no point in starting this unless there is some
&gt; &gt; kind of commitment in terms of resources.
