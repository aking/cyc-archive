Ian Niles &lt;iniles@teknowledge.com&gt;, to Matthew West:

&gt;I understand your position.  I'm still not convinced that a 4D orientation
&gt;cannot be incorporated into the merged ontology, and I think the replacement
&gt;of the 'Continuant'/'Occurrent' dichotomy with the
&gt;'ContinuantType'/'OccurrentType' division is a step in this direction,
&gt;because this division is consistent with the claim that things in themselves
&gt;are neither continuants nor occurrents (rather, type descriptions are
&gt;continuant-like or occurrent-like).  Furthermore, nothing in the merged
&gt;ontology (to my knowledge) is inconsistent with the claim that everything as
&gt;a space-time worm.  If you disagree, could you cite an axiom or subclass
&gt;relationship from the merged ontology that, by your lights, is inconsistent
&gt;with this claim.

Oh, come on Ian!  All the mereotopology, all the time-interval theory 
and all the 'holes'; the continuant/occurrent distinction; Virtually 
any concept that refers to 'ordinary things' (which is a loose phrase 
for 'continuant' here). Almost the entire upper classification will 
have to be re-done.  Might be worth trying it, though. If I  had any 
spare time I wouldnt mind having a go at it myself.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: The inferences (in both directions) constitute the
&gt; &gt; mapping. A mapping
&gt; &gt; specification may be developed for members of particular classes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: The advantage of this approach is that different world
&gt; &gt; viewpoints are
&gt; &gt; respected and kept separate, whilst we learn explicitly of
&gt; &gt; the relationship
&gt; &gt; between them, and we have a basis for challenging the utility and
&gt; &gt; completeness of particular world viewpoints.
&gt;
&gt;Well, in compiling the first few versions of the merged ontology, I've done
&gt;my best to avoid adopting a "world viewpoint".

Ian, it is IMPOSSIBLE to avoid adopting a world view when making an 
ontology. Your view shines through almost every comment you make like 
a bright light. It is clear that you think like what might be called 
an Aristotelian endurantist: you see "ordinary" physical things as 
real and lasting through time, you find solid physical things as more 
real than things like spaces and surfaces; you think that things of 
zero thickness can't be spatiotemporally located; you think that 
universals exist.

&gt;I'm sure that many
&gt;assumptions about the real nature of the world have crept in, but the aim
&gt;has always been to create a high-level language that supports anything that
&gt;we would ever want to say in a formal context.

Anything, ever? That is a very large claim.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Continuant does not compute in "my" ontology.
&gt;
&gt;If this implies that you are unable to ascribe continuant-like properties to
&gt;(what we ordinarily regard as) objects, then that sounds like a limitation
&gt;of your ontology.

Ian, "continuant" is not a natural kind, a term of nature; it is a 
term which is only meaningful within one philosophical approach to 
ontology. There are other approaches, and I agree with Matthew that 
the 4-d one is of considerably greater utility. (It is (still) the 
only ontological framework within which one can even begin to 
describe fluids adequately, for example, and it is the basic 
framework used throughout qualitative physical reasoning, for good 
reasons: nothing else cuts the mustard.) You may not agree, of 
course, many people don't.  But to say that a rejection of the 
concept of continuant is a "limitation", is to be blinkered by one 
world-view. Of course everyone agrees that what we ordinarily regard 
as objects must be describable in any ontology. But it doenst follow 
that they must be described as continuants.

&lt;big snip&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: That's interesting. So a piece of paper with writing on
&gt; &gt; it is abstract.
&gt; &gt; Now I always thought you could pick a piece of paper up?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I think you have a problem. A piece of paper is either
&gt; &gt; abstract or not.
&gt;
&gt;Well, the idea was that things like books are composite entites.  They have
&gt;an abstract component (the informational content) and a physical component,
&gt;since they are chunks of matter with a host of spatio-temporal properties.
&gt;Accordingly, a book is, on this view, both an abstract thing and a physical
&gt;object.  I'm willing to revise this view, if strong counterarguments come to
&gt;light, but it doesn't strike me as obviously false.

It does if being an abstract thing means what it seems to mean, ie 
membership in a class. Being X and having an X-ish 'component' are 
not quite the same thing, are they? And just what do you mean by 
being 'composite' and having a 'component', in any case?
