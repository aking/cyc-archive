chris,

you seem just to just take it for granted that anybody
who talks differently about logic than you do simply
must be totally unschooled in the subject, so this
obliges me to try and give some account of myself.

i spent 7 years before the mast of graduate studies in mathematics,
during which time my day to day and midnight oil business was that
of re-proving one damn clasical result after another and trying in
the offtime to think up a few new theorems of my own -- so I have
that knack that is commonly known as &quot;knowing what a proof is&quot;,
and i can sniff out a skunk of an axiom system an e-mile away.
i can tell you as a matter of practice that the niceties of
formal logic of the sort that i learned from the phil dept
hardly ever entered into this, that the lion's share of
the difficulty was always at the level of mathematical
content, not logical form.  it was a rare moment if
i got to exploit anything fancier than conversion
through the contrapositive, and though it was my
wont to take some guilty pleasure in indirect
proofs, such an act would usually incur the
sanction of my gurus and my tribe alike.

but i did make that trek over the river (red cedar)
and through the woods to the philosophy department
to see how the other half lived, and i was did get
a bit of my brain brought up in the church of that
trinity frege-russell-quine, some echoes of which
i believe i can trace in the doctrine you preach.

but there were many things that i found to question
in all of these teachings and preachings about logic,
and in my quest for further enlightenment i happened
on peirce, and a few other notables less notorious,
who, wonder of wonders, appeared to have had many
if not most of the very same worries and to have
asked the same questions long before i was born.

things changed after that, sometimes quickly,
sometimes mind-grindingly slowly, and they
continue to change to this day.  and all
of my assumptions that i knew just how
i did what i did when i reasoned got
kicked in the can when i took to the
computer to make my case to a rock.

for instance, in my present way of seeing things logical, there is nothing
especially sacrosanct, uniquely recommendable, or absolutley unquestionable
about the &quot;doctrine of the individual&quot; upon which a lot of your assumptions
about &quot;objects&quot;, ontology, definite description, denotation, reference,
singulars, variable binding, quantification, etc, appear bound to rest.

for another thing, i regard logic as being very special study, falling
within the intersection of ethics and semiotics both, and what you might
consider to be &quot;incidentals&quot;, like denotation, effective description, and
the actual deliberate and critically reflective practice of the craft, are
qualities that constitute its very strained essence to me.

JA: so let us ask:  what is the object of logic?
    in other wise:  what is the purpose of any logical language?

JA: without even trying to give a complete answer to that,
    i would be willing to venture, as i've always ventured,
    that one object of logic is &quot;to denote objects&quot;, in the
    many senses of the word &quot;object&quot;, in the objective world.

JA: without even trying to say, just yet, how such an objective is possible,
    let us take it for granted, for now, that such an objective is worthy,
    and let us adopt it as one of our provisional objectives for logic.

CM, quoting SR, quoting JA:

JA: without even trying to give a complete answer to that,
    i would be willing to venture, as i've always ventured,
    that one object of logic is &quot;to denote objects&quot;, in the
    many senses of the word &quot;object&quot;, in the objective world.

CM: This is incoherent.

perhaps, but mostly it is just rabidly detached from its intended context,
and probably just incongruent with the meanings that you attach to certain
key words, like &quot;object&quot;.  but this seems like a familiar misunderstanding,
by now.  logic is a normative science, but logical languages -- i am using
zol (monadic predicates, prop calc, sentential logic) as a paradigm case
for now -- can be used to give qualitative descriptions of many things,
abstract and concrete, and that is all that I am really talking about.
but one way to rationalize the way that many people talk, so as to
render what they say more coherent, is to think of sentences as
denoting propositions, and to think of propositions as being
patterns of feature concurrences, which can be rationalized
by interpreting logical propositions as functions, and
thus linking up with the way that the world gets
described in many quantitative realms, from
comp sci to info sci to physics to stats.

CM: It is an object of our use of names,
    definite descriptions and the like
    to denote objects, but the practice
    of denoting has nothing to do with
    logic.

now that is incoherent.

does the practice of denoting/describing maybe
have something to do with the practice of logic?
that is just what it means to investigate logic
with a &quot;serious engineering purpose&quot; in mind.

CM: Denotation per se, of course, plays a *role* in logic -- predicate logic,
    anyway -- insofar as denotations must be assigned to singular terms in
    a semantics for a logical language.  But it makes no sense to say that
    the act of denoting itself (what else does &quot;to denote objects&quot; mean?)
    is an object of logic, as if logic somehow grounds, or aids in,
    the practice.

look, i took those courses, too, and i know the particular
world view that comes out of them.  but there was a way of
seeing logic that preceeded this tunnel vision of it, and
with a little bit of luck will see the light at the end.

i cannot imagine what you think a normative science is for,
if not to have some bearing on actual conduct and practice.

all i am asking here is for everybody to search their own hearts and to ask
themselves:  &quot;what is a logical language supposed to be good for, anyway?&quot;,
and then to compare and contrast various concrete implementations of sundry
logical languages with regard to how well they facilitate the chosen purposes?
however you choose to say it, is that really so much to ask?

SR: And I am willing to venture that this denotation of objects is ~not~
    the goal of logic but a mere diversion, and is mostly a fantasy of pie
    in the sky.  Rather the goal of logic is to get agents to agree.

CM: Well, that's a claim that at least has some history to it among the pragmatists.

neo-fragmatism  =/=  pragmatism.

CM: Though I'd have thought that guns were a far more effective tool.
    But the view is confused.  It is nice if people agree because of the
    validity of the relevant arguments, but it is hardly the *goal* of logic
    to get people to agree.  If it were, then logic would be a subdiscipline
    of psychology;  logical investigation would consist in identifying those
    uses of language that, as a matter of empirical fact, most effectively
    lead to agreement.  But logic is not an empirical science, it is normative.
    The goal of logic is to identify and systematize principles of *correct*
    reasoning -- notably, inferential principles that preserve truth -- just
    as ethics identifies and (when possible) systematizes principles of correct
    action.  Logic *might* be useful in getting people to agree -- though I know
    of a lot of sound arguments that seem to be falling on deaf ears these days --
    but it is useful only if people at the outset are willing and able to follow
    its dictates.

SR: Tis better to be in sync, than to be true.

CM: Mullah Omar couldn't have put it better.
