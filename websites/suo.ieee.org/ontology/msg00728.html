&gt; &gt; Arisbeans, RDF Lodgers, SemioComrades, Stand Up Ontologists,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a sense that the recent questions of Seth Russell and Robert Meersman
&gt; &gt; are pointing to a deeper lying qualm about the nature of our discussion here,
&gt; &gt; that -- behind, beneath, and beyond the points of a "comment on style" (COS)
&gt; &gt; that affect nothing more worthy of note than the character of one individual
&gt; &gt; author-ship's peculiar writing affectations -- putting that aside, they cast
&gt; &gt; to the fore a complex assortment of issues on which this group has long been
&gt; &gt; divided into a host of different camps, to wit, the polyphemic protean topic
&gt; &gt; that I will try, this time out, to express in terms of the following queries:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | Why is it necessary to reflect on signs?
&gt; 
&gt; On the whole, it isn't, most of the time.

This is, of course, our normal condition, that is, our ordinary state of affairs,
our automatic, blithe, confident and confluent, devil-may-care and dreamy existence,
that who among us would leave of our own free will if we had a choice, and if it were
not that we have, on occasion, "bad dreams", or anticipate the chance of having one
if we continue in what appears to be our otherwise untroubled ways.

Nobody asks for trouble -- a few will see it coming just a bit sooner than others,
and a few of that number will be deluded, as it turns out, in their impressions --
but nobody enters on this "investigation of signs" (IOS) just for the fun of it --
no, not even me and thee.

&gt; One tends to get more things done by using signs than reflecting about them.

Right up to the point where one doesn't ...

&gt; At times, of course, one needs to pay attention to the signs themselves ...

Would this be a good time for you?

&gt; but one can get rather, shall I say, obsessive about this topic,
&gt; since everything that is said about anything is (of course) said
&gt; with a sign, and so if one always pays attention to the signs and
&gt; not enough to their content, then one is in a constant state of
&gt; sign-tripping, like someone with OCD

Optical Character Disorder?

&gt; who can't go outside without checking a dozen times to see if his tie is straight.

Damn!  You just had to make me think of that, didn't you!?

&gt; As well as getting on everyone else's nerves,
&gt; the result is a kind of paralysis where nothing
&gt; substantive ever actually gets said or done.

Sounds terrible!  Who would want that!?

&gt; For the SUO there is a deeper reason, however.
&gt; "Signs", in your terminology, refers to a topic
&gt; in semiology.  But -- and please forgive me for
&gt; emphasising this point, but it deserves a little
&gt; emphasis -- ONTOLOGY IS NOT A SEMIOLOGICAL TOPIC.

Don't make me get my Runes out!

Hmm, now, let me see ...
(he seeks, he finds) ...
abridging just a bit:

"Ontology = Logos(Ontos)"

Seems to me that Logos has got the upper hand
in this particular brand of application ...

Just keep it up, and I'll hit you with my Peirce!

I think maybe you got the wrong room --
Zen 101 is down the hall ...
B there or B^2, Dude!

&gt; That is, 'ontology' refers to what there IS,
&gt; not to how people talk about it.

I see, it's THE CAPITALIST THEORY OF BEING!

&gt; It is, right at its very heart,
&gt; fundamentally, about the world,
&gt; not about signs;  and still less
&gt; about human *use* of signs.

I don't want to talk about it.

But since you insist, I must
confess that those of us who
have not yet been graced by
seeing the "Face Of Being",
Face To Face, as it were --
strike that! -- as it IS,
well, we must continue to
struggle along with our
dark glasses on.  Please
be so kind as not to kick
this blind and lame fool's
crutch out from under him!

&gt; &gt; | Why not just talk about the objects alone?
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, why not?  In fact, that is almost certainly what language
&gt; evolved to do, viz. to talk about objects;  and since the objects
&gt; (and the stuffs and events and all that other material of the World)
&gt; are our Ontological subject matter, why not talk about them, indeed?

Cf: God?
He ain't talking.
He don't have to!
We will just have to wing it --
Cf: PTOS (Pragmatic Theory of Signs).

&gt; &gt; | Why not just use signs without mentioning them?
&gt; 
&gt; Every time your finger hits a key, you use a sign.
&gt; Even to mention a sign, you must use another sign.
&gt; Without using signs, you can only be mute.

You wish!

&gt; So the force of your question might be better put as:
&gt; why mention signs?  Indeed.  Allow me to suggest a pragmatic rule:
&gt; it is usually best to use a sign first to see what it does, and to
&gt; resort to mentioning it only as a last resort, if it doesnt do what
&gt; one intended.

I never thought of that.
I will try that sometime.

Yours Sine-Cerely,
"Sans Wax" To You,

Jon Awbrey
