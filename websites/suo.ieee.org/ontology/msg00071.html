Pat,
I saw your note on the SUO list regarding alternate ontologies.  You are
obviously correct about the impossibility of getting everyone to agree
on a "single coherent upper level ontology". I do think it is possible
to create a single upper level ontology - a standard Reference Ontology
(RO) - that a vast majority of users would find acceptable.  To be
successful,  the RO should be implemented as a software artifact on a
widely known (university, research institute, etc.) server, declared to
be fully in the public domain and completely free.

Even though alternative ontologies can be "equally valid and coherent,
even though they differ from one another" the Reference Ontology would
widely accepted if it is well constructed, serves most user purposes and
is free.  If the RO is not widely adopted it should be considered a
failure regardless of  its intellectual merit.

Correspondingly, if the alternative "standard" ontologies are not widely
adopted they should also be considered failures (both individually and
in the aggregate) regardless of their intellectual merit.  I don't wish
to demean intellectual merit.  An ontology might have considerable
intellectual merit and be of great value to a small group of users -
especially if they are researchers - but not be of value to a wide
audience.  The failure is their inability to become a "standard" in the
sense of reaching  a large enough and diverse enough audience.  The
imprimatur of any standards organization (IEEE, ANSI or ISO, etc.) will
not matter if there is not wide acceptance.

I don't believe the SUO group is likely to create a standard upper level
ontology if "widely adopted" is part of the meaning of standard. The
notes posted indicate that participants have many and differing agendas
- intellectual, commercial, and  personal.  However, it is possible that
the group will create something that gains the imprimatur of a standards
group.

In a (much) earlier note to the SUO list I suggested that CYC should be
considered the default SUO.  They have a working ontology that is the
best known and most widely used.  Of course, everyone would have
constructed CYC differently - and, I suspect, different from each
other.  Reasonable people may disagree with many aspects of CYC but I
don't think one can reasonably argue that it is not well thought out and
created on a scale much larger than other general purpose ontologies.

If one cannot create a general purpose upper level ontology that is
significantly better than CYC then the effort should stop.  An ontology
that is about as good or somewhat better than CYC is not worth the cost
(which will be large).  I believe such an ontology can be created, but
not easily and not by volunteer labor.

Some of the subscribers to this list will know that I have pursued the
goal of a Reference Ontology for a number of years. The difficulty has
been that the cost is large and the result (to be widely adopted) must
be entirely free. I am still optimistic about both the ability to create
a Reference Ontology that will be widely accepted and to fund such an
effort.

Bob
