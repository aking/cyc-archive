&gt; John, Jon, Pat,
&gt; 
&gt; Here are several questions about semantics ranging from general to specific.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  What are the papers that discuss the relationship between
&gt;     Tarski's semantics [attached PDF] and Peirce's semiotics
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jzeman/peirces_theory_of_signs.htm">http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jzeman/peirces_theory_of_signs.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt; ?

Sorry, I do not understand your question here.

Free association:  Peirce Scholar Mary Keeler recently remarked to me that
Peirce never really used the term "semantic" -- I have been meaning to check
this out as soon as I get the CD version of CP, hopefully in a couple of weeks,
if I am judged to have been nice enough this year -- but it illustrated to me
the way that one anachronistically projects one's present usage into one's
reading of the texts of the past, and not just the texts, but the events.

Much of the current confusion as to what Peirce really said about that
Triple Muse, SyntacTic-SemanTic-PragmaTic, Tic-Tic-Tic, was caused by
the secondary sources and the tertiary commentators -- Charles Morris,
Ogden &amp; Richards, and Walker Percy come to mind especially acutely --
who, for all their skill as apologists and popularizers, did what the
ilk of such writers usually do, which is to try to assimilate complex,
difficult, and rather unfamiliar perspectives and topics to the opinions
and the points of view that constitute the currently comfortable fashions
and the presently fashionable comforts of their prospective audience.

As it happens, it was actually Morris, the Categorizer, who was, by the way,
endeavoring to make Peirce's work palatable to the Analytic VIP's of his day,
who had the Gall to divvy up the omnibus of Peirce's Theory of Signs this way.
That is the way that I first encountered it myself, and I never had much trouble
with this scheme, until I began to see, much later and much lately, how corrosive
are the Barnacles that were thus Procrusted on the Ship of Signs in the Mean Times.
So my advice, learned the hardest way, would be to recur to the pure Peirce per se.

The rest of your question-set will take more concentration, reflection,
and time than I can scrape together right at the moment, so I will try
to get back to it later in the day.  Just skimming over the remainder,
they look like really good questions, so I will be looking forward to
my revisit with a measure of pleasant anticipation.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey


&gt; 2.  More specifically, can we relate (identify in some sense)
&gt;     model-theoretic interpretations with sign relations:
&gt;     interpretation corresponds to interpretant constant,
&gt;     function, predicate symbols -- c, f, p -- correspond to signs [,]
&gt;     interpretation images -- I[c], I[f], I[p] -- correspond to objects

&gt; 3.  In particular, what is the nature of the interpretation image I[c]?
&gt;     Can this be a "real world object", notwithstanding what John says below,
&gt;     in the World part of the diagram
&gt;
&gt;     <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A>
&gt;
&gt;     or does it have to be a "surrogate" existing in some formal semantic domain?
&gt;     For example, in the sentence "John Sowa is less than ten feet tall", can I not
&gt;     define an interpretation that maps the string "John Sowa" to the actual individual
&gt;     within the domain of actual individual people, or do I need to interpret it as some
&gt;     surrogate such as the email address sowa@bestweb.net?
&gt;
&gt; 4.  Are sign relations completely relative --
&gt;     can their objects be thought of as signs in a different sign relation?
&gt;     Can the real world objects in the diagram above be regarded as signs?

&gt; Subject:  Re: SUO: Re: Basic Terminology
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will have to let this one go for now.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I go some distance with Tarski, but when
&gt; &gt; &gt; it comes down to a choice between Peirce's
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Tarski's approaches, and it occasionally does,
&gt; &gt; &gt; well, I think that you can guess which path I follow.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I regard Tarski's work as a useful subset of Peirce's.
&gt; &gt; I would place it on the side of the mapping, model &lt;-&gt; theory.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6.  Finally, there is the question of how or whether the "individuals"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     in D and the "relations" in R correspond to anything in the world.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     This is a very important question that has not yet been adequately
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     addressed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; When anybody tries to address it, their address is not e-listed much.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I observe that this is a persistently prevailing phenomenon, and when
&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody starts to talk about the real world, peoples' e-tention spans
&gt; &gt; &gt; shrink to the point of e-vanishment ....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, yes.  When you talk with logicians,
&gt; &gt; they tend to turn off the discussion by saying that
&gt; &gt; Tarski's model theory solves the problem by "identifying"
&gt; &gt; the "individuals" in the model with "things" in the world.
&gt; &gt; That move makes it impossible to discuss the real issues.
