Jon,

I agree with John S. and John V. -- all the poetry and word play, gets in
the way. With the volume of email I need to read each day, I can at most
quickly glance at a message to determine if I'm interested in reading it in
detail. If the content is not clear and interesting, I have to ignore the
message -- a message with lots of poetry and word play is more likely not to
get read in detail.

For everyone's benefit, there is a good summary of principles for clear
technical writing at:

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Jon,
&gt;
&gt; I, like many other subscribers to SUO list, agree with
&gt; John Velman's request:
&gt;
&gt; JV&gt; Can you possibly put aside the poetry
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and word play for a while ...
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and get succinctly to the technical
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (or philosophical, if you will) point?
&gt;
&gt; John was trying to make a constructive suggestion.
&gt;
&gt; JA&gt;I really do not understand this conduct.
&gt; &gt;&gt;I do not make a practice of suggesting
&gt; &gt;&gt;prior constraints on what other people
&gt; &gt;&gt;choose to contribute, of telling them
&gt;
&gt; He was not trying to constrain what you contribute,
&gt; but trying to suggest a way of writing that will encourage
&gt; people to read what you have to say rather than pressing the
&gt; delete button as soon as they see your name on a message.
&gt;
&gt; JV&gt;I meant this with the best of intentions as advice on how to
&gt; reach some of
&gt; your
&gt; &gt;audience more effectively.
&gt;
&gt; And I believe that his points are shared by a great many
&gt; people who subscribe to SUO list:
&gt;
&gt; JV&gt;Of course you are free to take my advice or not.  I also
&gt; understand that
&gt;
&gt; &gt;this is just my view, and I'm not claiming that my view is the consensus
&gt; &gt;view, or even a view shared by anyone else.   If you don't think
&gt; the advise
&gt;
&gt; &gt;is good advice, OK.
&gt;
&gt; JA&gt;so I do not comprehend why other people
&gt; &gt;&gt;feel like they can take these unreciprocal
&gt; &gt;&gt;liberties with what I am given to do here.
&gt;
&gt; John V. is saying politely what other people have said
&gt; much more bluntly.  He is not "taking liberties", but he
&gt; is making the point that your style is getting in the way
&gt; of substance -- i.e., your potential readers are tuning out.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I write the way that I think -- it is not
&gt; &gt;&gt;being made up to be anything else but that.
&gt; &gt;&gt;I do believe that I write in several diverse
&gt; &gt;&gt;styles -- could be it's only me who thinks so --
&gt; &gt;&gt;and some of them I believe are very detailed,
&gt; &gt;&gt;rigorous, succinct, even terse, to the point
&gt; &gt;&gt;that they bore me to tears if not everyone else.
&gt;
&gt; I forget exactly where Chekhov said it, but in describing
&gt; his writing style, he made an excellent suggestion:
&gt; whenever he wrote a passage that he was especially proud of,
&gt; he realized that it was more an act of self-indulgence
&gt; than an effective way of communicating with his audience.
&gt; Therefore, he deliberately deleted it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am doing the best that I can,
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am tired of trying to be sorry,
&gt;
&gt; I think you are capable of doing much better, but you need
&gt; some drastic self-editing.  If you can't bring yourself to
&gt; kill your babies, as Chekhov did, perhaps it would be best
&gt; to ask someone else to read your notes before you send them
&gt; -- perhaps your wife or a colleague -- and not to spare
&gt; the eraser.
&gt;
&gt; John Sowa
