&gt; Dear Lee,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since I do not view your position as philosophically or 
&gt; &gt; logically adequate
&gt; &gt; to the full range of human experience, 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I note this. What I lack is evidence or proof that your view is
&gt; correct. If you can identify where the position is inadequate and
&gt; which ranges of human experience it does not apply to then we might
&gt; make progress.

There was a Polish philosopher named Tadeusz Kotarbinski who took
something like your position to great lengths.  He variously called his
position reism, pan-somatism, concretism, semantic reism. Tarski, insofar
as he bothered to work out a metaphysical position, acknowledged
Kotarbinski as his master and his early and famous work on truth in formal
systems is couched to make place for a reist approach.

I once spent a good bit of effort to show how this position, which is not
my own, can be stretched to cover just about anything, including ethics
and aesthetics. But it has one great limitation that may have some bearing
on an SUO effort.  It covers experience after the fact, after the
experience has become manifest in some spatio-temporal phenomenon.  It
thus sees little point in asserting experience, human or otherwise, as a
broader category than empiria.  Thus in your recent exchange on 'giving'
with Chris Menzel, you cover giving after an act of giving has become
manifest, while Chris would like to assert some ternary aspect to the
logic of giving, or in natural language to the dative case, whether or not
it is made manifest in an activity.

Now I would not argue that you fail to 'cover' giving, since you can
provide a verbal account of each and every instance after it occurs, and
once an act has occurred to every 'extension' of it in the sense you use
this term, but I would argue that there is something about the logic of
the dative case that is missing in your view of it. And I would also argue
what is missing in the binary view of giving is also missing in the binary
treatment of other concepts crucial to an account of human institutions,
including the institution of science.

With respect to a computational ontology to be used in conjunction with a
relational database, my argument may make no practical difference so long
as we are interested in using the ontology to search and mine what has
already been achieved and certified in some sense as information.  But to
the extent that we may wish to use an ontological artifact for sciences of
discovery or for deliberation, which contain a purely hypothetical or even
imaginative element, and in which we wish to be especially alert to
emergent categories and to the repurposing and reconceptualizing of
information for unanticipated needs, we may want to provide
architectonically for a position that concedes a degree of reality to
concepts without grounding them dogmatically in some 'concrete'
manifestation and its extensions. 

I am, of course, able to participate cheerfully in an ontology constructed
on principles in the general family to which your position belongs, so
long as the purpose of the effort is clarified to be limited to uses for
which this position is appropriate.  But if, as in our current effort,
there is strong resistance to narrowing the purpose, I would counsel that
what I would regard as a more capacious and open-ended view not be ruled
out prematurely.



Lee

 &gt; &gt; &gt; I am trying to locate 
&gt; &gt; the virtue of
&gt; &gt; your position, which seems to have been well thought out, by 
&gt; &gt; construing it
&gt; &gt; as adequate some to more limited range of human experience-- 
&gt; &gt; in this case,
&gt; &gt; experience with trying to represent a portion of experience within the
&gt; &gt; limitations of relational databases. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You should see this as part of the history of how we arrived here, 
&gt; rather than as a guiding principle.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I thought that this was also the
&gt; &gt; virtue that Frederick Chase saw in it. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Fred seems to understand some of the background I come from.
