&gt; &gt; I have a similar problem understanding the following categories. In
&gt; &gt; any sense of 'relation' I understand, it doesnt make sense to say
&gt; &gt; that a relation is either a continuant or an occurent. Relations
&gt; &gt; don't exist through time, they hold between entities. So what do
&gt; &gt; these categories even mean?
&gt;
&gt;MW: Well I agree that is how relations should be used, but take the
&gt;relation:
&gt;(married Matthew Lydia)
&gt;This does not hold for all time.

Well, in my logic, if you say it like that it DOES hold for all time, 
so you said the wrong thing. People write things like this because it 
reads like the English sentence "Matthew and Linda are married", 
forgetting that English sentences are always spoken with an implicit 
'now' (and often an implicit 'here' or 'this way' as well), and since 
our logical languages are not indexical, we need to somehow make all 
this implicit stuff explicit.

&gt;Of course the problem is that people are
&gt;modelling the wrong thing, but what some people do (and I have done - not
&gt;now recommended) is to add some temporal information to the relation, so
&gt;something like:
&gt;
&gt;(married Matthew Lydia 3-Jul-1976 present) (yes 25 years coming up)
&gt;
&gt;So what is this? You could call it a temporal relationship. There are
&gt;(believe me) worse things that people do.
&gt;
&gt;(Of course it really represents the state of Matthew and the state of Lydia
&gt;from 3-Jul-1976 to the present, and a timeless relation between them, but
&gt;that is several steps away from what is represented here, which seems to be
&gt;a relationship that is also a spatio-temporal extent.)

Yes, I agree that people do all these things. People also lay 
landmines, but it shouldnt be encouraged.
I think the 'nonrecommended' temporal-parameter has its uses, but 
should be thought of as an abbreviation for the 4-d temporal-slices 
version, which I agree is the most general formulation.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Assembly "A CorpuscularObject whose discrete parts are
&gt; &gt; &gt;completely separable.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What does 'completely separable' mean? (I can have the paint
&gt; &gt; sandblasted off my car: is it therefore completely separable?)
&gt;
&gt;MW: OK here I will come to Ian's defence. I am sure what Ian means is
&gt;something that can be taken apart and put back together again repeatedly
&gt;without damage.
&gt;
&gt;So the paint is not separable from your car, because it can't be reassembled
&gt;(or at least only with extreme difficulty).

OK, that makes sense, but it isnt consistent with what is underneath 
'cospuscular' If you look later, you will see for example that 
'Organic' is under 'corpuscular'. A butcher can take it apart, but it 
takes a damn fine surgeon to put it all back together without damage. 
In fact, strictly speaking it is pretty difficult to do this even to 
a car, if the 'parts' include things like the brake fluid and the 
gaskets.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;MW: Well I have used pretty much just this example to explain the difference
&gt;between a collection (sense of fusion) and an assembly relation between a
&gt;whole and its parts. I'm not sure if this is Ian's sense here. He seems to
&gt;be talking about the wholes, rather than the relations but the distinction
&gt;is much the same. The key is that with a collection (fusion) the whole is
&gt;precisely the sum of the parts, with an assembly the whole is something more
&gt;than the sum of the parts. It is quite interesting just how many sorts of
&gt;whole/part there are (and which ones really are distinct and useful).

Interesting observation, which ought to be relevant to Guarinian 
ideas about individuation criteria. Got any proto-classification of 
kinds of part/whole relationships? (The sociologist Irving Goffman 
had some lovely ones, eg a 'with', which is a group of people all 
keeping conversational contact with one another inside a large crowd, 
like a group of friends at a football match. They neednt be in 
physical contact and might drift apart for a while, but soon get back 
within speaking distance.)


&gt;. If some piece of a machine starts to move, one can split
&gt; &gt; the space-time of the machine so as to focus on, say, the leading
&gt; &gt; edge of the moving part during the movement (is this an occurrent or
&gt; &gt; a continuant? Why should I give a damn?)
&gt;
&gt;MW: Quite - not that I would use such language :-)

Yes, but then you probably aren't Irish.


&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is
&gt; &gt; indefinitely divisible to
&gt; &gt; &gt;the limits of perception by the available sense organs or measuring
&gt; &gt; &gt;instruments.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How do we classify things which are partly continuous and partly not?
&gt; &gt; (You know, like almost any complicated piece of machinery, say; or a
&gt; &gt; company, for example.)
&gt; &gt; Again, it is poor strategy to introduce epistemic notions like
&gt; &gt; perception into the explanation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;MW: This is also a matter of scale. If I have a glass of water, I can easily
&gt;divide it up until I get to a single water molecule, but then division is
&gt;impossible withou deconstructing the water molecule (and there are certainly
&gt;instruments that can perceive a water molecule). The same thing happens with
&gt;sand. However, a football crowd could just as easily be treated as something
&gt;continuous, or traffic, or a galaxy. Something being continuous really says
&gt;that you are only interested in properties at an aggregate level relative to
&gt;the scale of the objects that make up the thing that is continuous.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Treating something as continuous is something we do - usually for
&gt;mathematical convenience, but it is not what anything is. (You might have
&gt;some discussion  about this at the sub-atomic scale, but that is largely a
&gt;reflection of this being where the boudaries of knowledge lie at present.)

I see what you mean, but I was meaning a different point. Lets agree 
that at some scale  a piece of rock, say, is continuous in the sense 
that a machine with many inner moving parts is not continuous. BUt 
now think of almost any reasonably complicated piece of machinery - a 
conveyor belt carrying coke to a furnace, say - and ask is *it* 
continuous or not? And the answer has to be, parts of it are and 
parts of it aren't.
...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which
&gt; &gt; is typical of
&gt; &gt; &gt;computer programs or idealized approximations to physical
&gt; &gt; processes, changes
&gt; &gt; &gt;occur in discrete steps called events, which are interleaved
&gt; &gt; with periods of
&gt; &gt; &gt;inactivity called states.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is a neat idea, but very hard to get right. The problem is to
&gt; &gt; say just what a period of inactivity is. That seems obvious until you
&gt; &gt; try to axiomatize it. For example, consider someone who falls asleep
&gt; &gt; while leaning on a door, thereby preventing the door from opening. In
&gt; &gt; a sense he isnt doing anything, just being there in an inactive
&gt; &gt; state; but if someone is trying to open the door, he IS doing
&gt; &gt; something: he is preventing them opening the door. (Under the right
&gt; &gt; surrounding circumstances he could be accused of negligent homicide.)
&gt; &gt; In computers we do have a fairly clear criterion for this notion of
&gt; &gt; 'inactivity', but computers are carefully crafted to make that
&gt; &gt; possible. On the other hand, there are plenty of examples of physical
&gt; &gt; processes which are best described as discrete, eg the motion of a
&gt; &gt; shuttle in a loom, or the action of a valve tappet; but these are not
&gt; &gt; interleaved with complete inactivity.
&gt;
&gt;MW: We have found this somewhat problematic.

I'm not surprised. Even lawyers have trouble with this one.

&gt;We have a rather broad view of
&gt;what a state is, which interestingly includes activities. So a state for us
&gt;is any piece of space time where the time dimension is non-zero (though it
&gt;may be vanishingly small). The useful ones are those for which some
&gt;predicate is true, e.g. being a person, being at 20C, being a husband, being
&gt;a football match etc. Some states are a temporal part of others. So being a
&gt;husband is a temporal part of being a person. Being a quarterback in a
&gt;particular footbal match is a temporal part of the football match AND a
&gt;temporal part of a person.
&gt;
&gt;MW: It really is possible to represent accurately quite complex ideas with
&gt;some very simple basic concepts - but this is what 4D is all about.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Oh the changes (timeless events) are the temporal boundaries of states.

Purely temporal, or could they slope? eg think of a moving sprayer, 
and the spatiotemporal locus of where the water stops being under 
high pressure.

&gt;They are when a state starts or stops. Generally we think of activities as
&gt;causing events, at some level.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals.
&gt; &gt; This is the root
&gt; &gt; &gt;node of the ontology.")
&gt;
&gt;MW: How can this be? If it is only the class of individuals, what are
&gt;classes a member of? If classes are a member of something else, then this is
&gt;not the root of the ontology.
&gt;
&gt;MW: If the ontology has a root (and I would certainly suggest it should
&gt;have) then it needs to be the class of all things (individuals, relations,
&gt;classes, and anything else you have).

Yes, good point.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A technical question: do spaces and times themselves have a location
&gt; &gt; in spacetime? (My own preference is to say not, but Cyc takes a
&gt; &gt; different view. But either way, we need a clear answer to avoid
&gt; &gt; rapidly descending into muddled axioms.)
&gt;
&gt;MW: Interstingly we see spaces and times as having a location in space time.
&gt;So a point in time is a plane through all space at a point in time (to keep
&gt;square with relativity, you have to add from some viewpoint - for which the
&gt;Earth is convenient). Similarly, a space is a 4D solid of some space for all
&gt;time (again relative to what is important). Things like 3pm, or January, or
&gt;sphere, are classes of time or shape.

OK, that is pretty much the Cyc view as well, insofar as it has a 
coherent view on this. So you basically don't distinguish between a 
point on the time-axis and the 3-d 'plane' of 4-space at that point? 
(Sod relativity, by the way.)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In
&gt; &gt; logic, the assertion
&gt; &gt; &gt;of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds
&gt; &gt; to some aspect
&gt; &gt; &gt;or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an
&gt; &gt; example, the
&gt; &gt; &gt;statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat
&gt; &gt; characterizes the
&gt; &gt; &gt;entity named Yojo.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This doesnt seem to distinguish the sentence from the proposition
&gt; &gt; expressed by that sentence. Exactly what a proposition is, is a
&gt; &gt; matter of controversy, but in at least one view, it isnt anything at
&gt; &gt; all like a sentence. BTW, what exactly is the word "Cat" supposed to
&gt; &gt; indicate in that last sentence?
&gt;
&gt;MW: Why is this a subclass of assembly? Propositions would appear to be
&gt;abstract. I expect things that are assembled to be things I can touch.

I think the intuition is that parsing is analogous to disassembly. 
Not *physical* disassembly, but a kind of conceptual taking-apart by 
assigning names to 'pieces' like noun phrases, etc. . But it seems a 
very limp analogy to use in an ontology.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some
&gt; &gt; other entity.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ? The relation is an entity in a relationship to some other entity?
&gt; &gt; So if (R a b), R is not the relation, but a and b are? This is just
&gt; &gt; nonsense.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Quite. I would be inclined to say "A class of tuples", but in KIF the
&gt;relation stands as a predicate, and I have never quite got to the bottom of
&gt;whether predicate and class are synonyms (for which I find as yet no
&gt;contrary evidence).

Strictly speaking a predicate (extension) on X is a set (= class) of 
1-tuples of members of X, rather than a set of members of X. To 
identify these is a common abuse of notation.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;MW: Yes (with my engineers hat on) What would a pipe be without the hole in
&gt;the middle?

Well, (with my carpenter's hat on), it sounds like a rod, or maybe a bar?
