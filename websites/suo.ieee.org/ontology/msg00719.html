As I suggested in an earlier reply to Matthew's point below, I think we
will find it very difficult to judge whether any ontology is good for any
purpose unless we are specific about the purpose.

For example, in building the Enterprise Ontology, I had very clearly in
mind that we should define the term Market in a way that was acceptable to
at least the three different commercial enterprises represented in the
project (and hopefully any other enterprise in the English-speaking world),
and that it would be a basis on which to found meaningful communication of
information between systems of different enterprises having information
about markets.  I believe that purpose was shared with my colleagues.  It
is a matter of judgement to what extent we may have suceeded.

In this SUO discussion, some people seem to be interested in comparable
examples, e.g. the purchase of a mower (Matthew) or billing events
(Graham).

I cannot judge whether or not Mike's view is flawed, or judge the value of
Chris's views, as neither of them states, nor makes reference to,
sufficiently specifc purposes.

The only statement I can find is the one (necessarily rather general) first
sentence of what I think is our current scope statement.  Have I missed
something, or is there a volunteer to draft a more specific statement of
purpose for discussion?

I would also be interested in knowing if the word traction has a
well-defined meaning in this context.

Yours, Martin

Mike,

You asked for a reply if the view is flawed.

I think it is - and importantly so for the ontology of operational computer
systems, If you study the history of science one of the things frequently
noted is that scientific revolutions involve a new theory that is both more
general and simpler than the original ones. I suspect we need a new
yardstick to describe this - sophistication say. Then one can have
generality with or without sophistication.

It seems to me that one of the reasons a lot of people hold the view you
put
forward is because of the nature of a particular ontology - let's call it
Aristotelian - which is implicit in a lot of database designs. Here there
is
a tree taxonomy - under which it seems that as you make things more general
you lose detail. If you have a lattice this is not so. Interestingly the
shift from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics, the structure of the theory
became more lattice-like, less tree-like. And also more general and more
'traction'. (if anyone is interested this is a central theme of my book
Business Objects).

It seems to me that one of the overriding reasons for producing an ontology
is to have something general with traction. My book describes a method for
taking more specific data models and constructing more general models with
more (not less) traction. In fact, one of the surprising aspects of my
experience using this is that generality naturally results in more rather
than less traction.

Regards,
Chris

Matthew West says:

One of the things I have learnt is what I think you are suggesting here:
that if something is OK for a particular purpose, then it is OK for a
particular purpose, and this is OK.

The problem is that it might not be OK for another purpose, what then? 10
different models of the same thing each OK for its particular purpose? not
much of a standard I think. On the other hand One model into which each of
these 10 could be translated, allowing communication between them all could
possibly be very useful, and something worth standardising.
---

There seems to be an implicit assumption here that is it POSSIBLE to
have an ontology that is good for all purposes, or at least a very very
wide range of them.  I think there is an inherent generality/power
tradeoff.
Only somethign very general can serve a very wide range of  purposes, but
then it will provide little traction. Somethgn very specific, designed for
a particular purpose will be more powerful, giving more traction, but will
serve fewer purposes. I see this a a fundamental tradeoff that will never
go away. Please correct me if this view is flawed.

Mike
