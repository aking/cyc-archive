Hi,

This posting follows up on four recent postings to the SUO
list concerning the foundations of ontology, basic terminology,
the nature of modeling, and the roles of syntax and semantics
in first-order logic. These four postings are:

1 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02304.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02304.html</A>
(November 22, 2000; John Sowa),
which deals with a suggested approach to the foundations of ontology.

2 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02398.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02398.html</A>
(November 29, 2000; John Sowa),
which deals with basic terminological distinctions.

3 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02412.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02412.html</A>
(November 29, 2000; John Sowa),
which discusses supervaluation and which refers to a figure at
<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A>. This figure
depicts relationships among World, Model, and Theory.

4 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02449.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02449.html</A>
(December 1, 2000; Robert Kent),
which supplies a PDF file describing "various syntactic and semantic
components of 1st order logic."


In posting 1, John Sowa considers the topic "foundations
of ontology" to be: "a critical examination of the principles for

    (1) analyzing a subject domain,
    (2) identifying and classifying critical aspects, and
    (3) specifying them in a way that some formalization
        in a language such as KIF would be possible."

I would like to sketch out some thoughts as fodder for discussion.
These thoughts are preliminary, informal, and perhaps naive;
I welcome suggestions that would help my meaning along.

What I am trying to do is understand some details of the three
steps as outlined by John, and to suggest that certain ideas from
postings 2-4 should also perhaps be part of such a critical examination.
Kind comments are most welcome.


A. Analyzing a subject domain.

   1) In considering a subject domain, do we need to consider the
      scope of the domain?  If so, how do we delimit the scope?
      How will we agree on the boundary of our inquiry?
      Is it appropriate, or perhaps even necessary given our language,
      that we tend to think in spatial metaphors when we consider
      the things represented by words such as "domain," "scope,"
      "delimit", "boundary"?  If it is appropriate or necessary
      to use such metaphoric language in describing our subject
      domain, are there significant consequences of this?  Are there
      identifiable limitations of spatially-based descriptions that
      constrain how we are able to describe our domain?

      And do such limitations of spatially-based language reach even
      further and constrain not just the ways we can describe our
      subject domain, but even the ways we can conceptualize our world
      - that is, our ontologies?  If so, would the fact of this constraint
      (the limitations of our own mental apparatus, especially as regards
      the use of spatial language to describe "nonspatial" things) be
      be a "critical aspect" of the foundations of ontology that
      we need to take into account?

   2) In considering any given subject domain, will we also need
      to consider where this subject domains trails off into other
      subject domains that are somehow "similar", "related" or "near by"?

      I am thinking here of the "context" of our subject domain.  We might
      describe this context as that which in some sense lies "outside"
      of the domain of inquiry, but which elucidates both the relationships
      within that domain and the manner in which this domain "sits in"
      its ambience.  This notion of context might also be viewed as
      "that which lies outside of, but is still related to our domain of
      interest" (related in the sense that it allows us to see connections
      that exist within our domain and connections that exist between what
      is in our domain and what is outside of it)."

      Again, are there consequences to using spatial language to
      describe and delimit our domain of inquiry?  And if there
      are consequences, what is their import for the foundations of
      ontology?


   3) The language used to describe to describe this notion of context,
      as well as the language used to describe and delimit our domain
      of inquiry - do these kinds of language use relate to the different
      kinds of language use that John described in posting 2?
      In that posting John said that some words are used to talk about
      syntax, others are used to talk about semantics, and others are
      used to "talk about the world itself, which we are trying to model..."

      On the surface, it seems that the language used to describe
      both the delimiting of our domain and the context of the domain
      is of this last kind.  But I wonder.  It seems that there may be
      some worthwhile distinctions to be made here.

      For instance, is there a relationship between the symbols and words
      used to describe a "syntax" and the words used to describe a given
      subject domain, in the sense that both a syntax and a subject domain
      can be understood in certain important ways "independently," without
      appeals to a broader, embedding context?  And is there a relationship
      between the metalanguage used to describe syntax and the language
      that describes the context of our domain, in the sense that both are
      designed to be "bridge-crossing" uses of language that allow us to
      broaden our understanding by explaining the connections that exist
      between the narrowly defined worlds and the "contexts" in which they
      sit?  If there are such relationships, are they merely curiosities,
      or do they have some import for the foundations of ontology?



B. Critical aspects

    1) Pick your definition of ontology.  Let's say this definition
       corresponds, roughly, to "a way of conceptualizing the world."
       If this can be granted, then shouldn't the foundations of ontology
       be concerned with the different _ways_ in which this
       conceptualizing can be (or is) done, as well as possible
       relationships among, and implications of, these different ways
       of conceptualizing? John, is this what you mean by "identifying and
       classifying critical aspects"?

       For instance, one way that people understand their world might be to
       "conceptualize the world by considering things to exist in
       hierarchical relationships with each other." Another way might
       be "conceptualizing the world by grouping somehow like things into
       categories" (where I may leave unstated for now the possible
       dependence of hierarchies upon categorization). And another way
       might be "conceptualizing at least certain parts of the world
       by considering some sort of order relation (temporal, spatial,
       linguistic) to hold among certain pieces of the world."

       Or, more broadly speaking, people can think of the world as
       "things and relationships between things", or "things and
       operations on things", or "everything is process", or "things and
       their changes through time." And people may then invoke
       similarly broad ways of describing these conceptualizations,
       by considering common and generally accepted ways of describing
       structures and operations (e.g., sets and functions, or objects
       and morphisms).

       John, in your view, do such different ways of viewing the world
       appropriately fall into what you call "critical aspects"?  Why
       or why not?  What might be other critical aspects that should be
       identified and classified?  Identification and classification
       themselves, for instance?


C. Specifying [critical aspects?] so that some formalization is possible.

      Here I'd like to refer to the notions of "Model", "World", and
      "Theory" from the figure that John Sowa mentioned in posting 3,
      as well as the table given by Robert Kent in posting 4, which has
      two columns: one for "LOGIC (SYNTAX)" and another for
      "MODEL THEORY (SEMANTICS)".

      1. What are the different ways in which a Model can be an
      approximation of the World?  And what criteria can
      be used to judge the "adequacy" (good, fair, poor) of the
      approximation for a given set of concerns?  Are these questions
      examples of the kinds of questions that should be addressed in
      a discussion of the foundations of ontology?  I'm particularly
      interested in what I loosely call "consistency" and the
      possible relationships between what might be called the
      "internal consistency" of the World, the "internal consistency"
      of the Model, and the consistency of the Model as an approximation to
      the World.  Are these kinds of issues fitting ones to be addressed
      in considering the foundations of ontology?

      2. What is the distinction between Model and Theory in
      John Sowa's diagram?

      One way of considering this question might be to ask if
      the Model and the Theory both represent self-contained worlds
      in the sense that neither depends on a metalanguage (from
      the World) in order to "make internal sense".  Do the Model
      and the Theory differ in this regard, and is it significant
      whether they do?  What I am suggesting is that there may be
      a useful analogy between,

      on the one hand,

      the kind of language we use to talk about and delimit a given
      subject domain, and the language we use to talk about the context
      or connections between this subject domain and a larger world

      and on the other hand,

      the kind of language used in describing and delimiting a "Model"
      or a "Theory," and the language we use to talk about the connections
      between a "Model" or "Theory" and the "World".

      I don't know if such an analogy exists. But I think if it does
      exist, its significance may have something to do with "insides"
      and "outsides" in the sense that the language used "in" certain
      domains may be inadequate for describing what is outside the domain
      or the connections between what lies inside the domain and what
      lies outside of it.  Perhaps this is just a truism, but it seems
      to be possibly based on a spatial use of language, and it may
      have implications as a foundational issue for ontologies.

      One answer to the question (what is the distinction between the
      Model and the Theory) may be that the Theory has no direct
      connection with the World, but the Model does.  Would this mean then
      that there is no explicit way to relate the truth or falsity
      established by the connection of "Model" and "Theory" to anything in
      the "World"?  Is there any implicit relationship between such truth
      or falsity and the quality of the "Model's" approximation to the
      "World"?  If there is an implicit relationship, is a consideration of
      the ways in which this relationship can be made explicit something
      that should be addressed in the foundations of ontology?
      (I believe this is what John Sowa was referring to in his
      6th point in the 2nd posting, where he says:

           "Finally, there is the question of how or whether the
           'individuals' in D [domain] and the 'relations' in
           R [ relational structure] correspond to anything in the world.
           This is a very important question that has not yet been
           adequately addressed.")

      3. In general, what would be required so that the critical
         aspects that John speaks of can be specified in a way
         that some formalization in a language such as KIF would be
         possible?  Are there specific properties, for instance
         that a model or a theory must have before it can be so
         formalized?


D. Summary

    1. I'd like to know if people think I'm at all on target with
       my comments and questions, in the following ways:

      a. Have I identified some possible critical aspects of
         the foundations of ontology as John Sowa described
         this topic in posting 1 mentioned above?  If not, what
         kinds of issues are meant?  If I have, what are some
         other issues that might be treated?

      b. I believe that the pervasive use in English of spatial language
         as a way of understanding our world may constrain how we are
         able to create "Models" and "Theories" of the "World."
         I think spatial notions come into play particularly when
         we describe, on the one hand, narrow and relatively well-defined
         domains of inquiry, and, on the other hand, the relationships
         between these domains and what lies "outside" of them.  But I
         am not convinced that such "spatial issues" lie within
         the scope of the foundations of ontology.

    2. I wonder whether it may make sense, in order to discover or create
       certain foundational principles, to work backwards so to speak
       and examine the kinds of ways that people have already
       created ontologies and the formalisms to express them.
       Would this be one operational way to approach the discussion
       of foundations?

    3. What are some other approaches that may be taken to examine
       the relevant principles for the foundations of ontology?
