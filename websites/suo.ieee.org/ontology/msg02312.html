&gt;   Concerning contextualization and the heap paradox:
&gt;
&gt;[Pat Cassidy]
&gt; &gt; &gt;   I can imagine using such precise limits in definitions [like
&gt; &gt; &gt;heap and grain] as being problematic only in some rare cases of
&gt; &gt; &gt;language understanding, but since multiple reiterative processes
&gt; &gt; &gt;are seldom referred to in normal language, I suspect that using
&gt; &gt; &gt;a limit will work in just about every practical situation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;[Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; Oh, come ON!  Engineers and practical folk have to reason about
&gt; &gt; multiple repetition all the time. Ask a blacksmith. Think of issues
&gt; &gt; of rate of wear of machine parts. Even biologists have to think about
&gt; &gt; cumulative error rates in DNA replication.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;   Yes, I left out the implied qualifier in the phrase, it should
&gt;have been: "multiple reiterative processes **involving vague
&gt;concepts like a heap** . . .".  The types of physical reiterative
&gt;processes you mention present no problem because the systems
&gt;are among those "just about every practical situation" where
&gt;making vague concepts precise is beneficial.

I deeply disagree. If you read almost any technical manual, listen to 
the ways people talk when teaching each other, and so on, you will 
find 'vague' concepts. In fact I would go so far as to claim that 
virtually *all* the concepts that people use in ordinary everyday 
discourse are 'vague' in this sense. Concepts like 'person' and 
'bowl' and 'board' and 'table' don't have sharp definitional 
boundaries. People even use small integers in 'vague' ways, as when a 
recipe calls for '3 or 4  grains of salt', and it doesnt really 
matter if you put in, say, 5, but it does matter if you put in 5000.

&gt;--
&gt;[Pat Cassidy]
&gt; &gt;&gt;  "large" is very dependent on context,
&gt; &gt; &gt;and might need many different definitons depending on context.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;[Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; But then that begs the question. If truths can be dependent on
&gt; &gt; 'context' then we can just say that 'large heap' depends on context.
&gt; &gt; How do you cash out this contextuality in axioms?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;   We can't avoid the contextuality of natural language; ignoring
&gt;*that* would be begging the central question of natural
&gt;language understanding.

Who said we were doing natural language understanding? I certainly am 
not, and I suspect most of the ontology effort is not devoted to 
doing so. I do not regard NL as central to ontology design: on the 
contrary, to make the connection is actively misleading, in my view.

If you want to say that ontologies are contextual, then you need to 
spell out the contextualization mechanism and how it is to be used. 
Ontologies are just sets of sentences in a formal logic. There is no 
obvious notion of 'context' ready to hand.

&gt;For axioms, see below.
&gt;
&gt;[Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; It seems quite obvious to me both that the
&gt; &gt; antecedents of the paradox are correct - heaps are finite, may be
&gt; &gt; large, and removing a single grain from a large heap never, in
&gt; &gt; itself, makes a large heap small  - and that the conclusion is
&gt; &gt; absurd, and yet that the reasoning has no obvious flaws in it.
&gt;
&gt;  I think it's clear that both can't be correct if both heap and
&gt;grain have unchanging definitions.

No, I insist. Stop being an engineer or a logician for a second and 
imagine you are a kid again. Isnt is just *obvious* that heaps can be 
large and can consist of humungous numbers of small grains, that 
taking just one grain away is never going to make a large heap not 
large, yet taking enough of them away will eventually do it. And that 
combination of facts isn't at all puzzling or mysterious: its just 
part of what we know about things like large heaps, part of what we 
know about the world; it is kind of obvious. The fact that one can 
derive a contradiction when this obvious thing is formalized suggests 
to me that there is something wrong with the formalization, not that 
there is anything wrong with the intuitions.

&gt; If at each iteration, the
&gt;"heap" is still a heap, and the "grain" is still a grain, then for
&gt;the statement to be true, something must change -- for example,
&gt;at some point

Something changes, yes, but nothing changes AT A POINT. That is 
(forgive the pun) the point.

&gt;the "grain" size would necessarily be smaller:

But that is obviously false. Think about sand on a beach. Picking up 
the sand doesn't make the grains get smaller.

&gt;
&gt;(forall ?x ?y
&gt;  (implies
&gt;    (and (heap ?x) (grain ?y))
&gt;      (greater-than
&gt;          (size-ratio ?x ?y) 100)
&gt;    )
&gt;  )
&gt;)
&gt;
&gt;   In this case, the "context" which is taken into account is
&gt;the number of prior iterations which allow one to still
&gt;consider the "heap" to be a heap, relative to whatever
&gt;one is willing to call a "grain".  The statement can be true
&gt;iteratively only if a "grain" is allowed to vary with the
&gt;size of the heap.
&gt;   This is somewhat similar to Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the
&gt;Hare. It is a paradox only if we assume that there is some
&gt;minimum size to the time interval at every iteration.  The
&gt;heap paradox is a paradox only if we assume that there is some
&gt;minimum size limit on the grain removed.

By all means let us make that assumption, since it is obviously true. 
(Minimum size limit on a grain of sand is , say, 0.1 mm)
