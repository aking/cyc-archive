David

Thanks for your pertinent questions. Answers below.
I forward to the topic map mailing list, in an attempt to bridge somehow the
two communities on those questions.

[PJ]

&gt; &gt; &gt; As I wrote, it can shift our focus from thinking in terms of a
top-down
&gt; &gt; &gt; ontological hierachy, toward thinking in terms of how concepts can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; defined in terms of other concepts, and finding a kernel of primitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; concepts and definitional mechanisms that appear to be sufficient for
&gt; &gt; &gt; defining all concepts one might need in a complete ontology.

[BV]

&gt; &gt; If this "paradigm shift" really comes true, please count me in. I tend
to
&gt; &gt; think that significative steps have been done in this kind of direction
by
&gt; &gt; the Topic Maps specification, and will gladly see the Topic Maps
primitive
&gt; &gt; concepts in this kernel. And maybe the kernel itself built like a Topic
Map.

[DW]

&gt; Frankly, until I see a worked example of something done in this way,
&gt; I'm not sure if I would support it or not.
&gt; I can understand the ideas behind an axiomatization of a formal theory.
&gt; How rigorous would this method be?

This method would be as rigourous as people using it :o)
Seriously. It's still an open field. A successful work has been done to
implement the Topic Maps concepts into XML DTD, which nobody here I suppose
will consider like an "axiomatization" or a "formal theory". In fact, the
formal model - or the conceptual model - for Topic Maps is still in debate.
A graph model is IMO the best candidate at the moment. But there are several
pending points concerning the distinction between theory primitives and
meta-level, recursivity and such. There are not that many people from the
"pure" formal logic community or other formalists in the TM community right
now, and we struggle as best we can :)

&gt; What kinds of inference would it support?

To bring the TM concepts at the inference level needs I think a
clarification of the above points. OTOH, trying to express inference rules
would maybe help the clarification process. As far as I know, nobody tried
so far to express any formal set of axioms and inference rules in TM syntax,
but I really think it's possible. IMO propositions could be expressed as
associations between primitive objects and inference rules as association
types linking (properly reified) propositions. As I understand it, RDF folks
are ploughing that field too; and there are many people eager to see
convergences of all those efforts.

&gt; The highest levels of an ontology like Cyc are useful in static
&gt; 'syntactic' level constraints on relation signatures, etc.

As a matter of fact, the Upper Cyc ontology has been expressed in XTM by
Murray Altheim (of Sun Microsystems).
See: <A  HREF="http://www.doctypes.org/cyc/cyc-xtm-20010227.html">http://www.doctypes.org/cyc/cyc-xtm-20010227.html</A>

&gt; What would the highest levels of this kind of ontology provide for
&gt; computation?

I'm not sure to understand your question here, ( maybe because the "highest
levels" don't appeal that much to me. As said elsewhere, talking about
"kernel" makes me a lot happier ...)

&gt; I assume we are still talking about using this as an information
&gt; source to a computer program, not a human, right?

The Topic Map paradigm has the pretention to somehow leverage both. Of
course what is at stake here is the information exchange between systems.
But, as Werner pointed out lately "all machines are working for the benefit
of humans [BV : let's take it for granted so far ...] and hence,
communication with humans is unavoidable". I suppose that any sustainable
ontology will have to support without too much distortion the full chain of
knowlege interchange:
human knowledge &gt; representation&gt; authoring interface &gt; system
implementation &gt; system interchange &gt; user interface &gt; representation &gt;
human knowledge.
I won't support a standardization effort only sustainable by the system, and
not taking into account the human authoring and user ends. That is anyway,
it seems, the claim of Topic Maps, that Steve Newcomb calls "Global
Knowledge Interchange". I suppose he means by "Global" : involving both
systems and humans.

&gt; How many of the topic map ideas are expressed unambiguously to be
&gt; useful input to a program which makes decisions?

I push that question in the middle of the Topic Maps forum. I've no real
competence to answer that I'm afraid.

&gt; Just a 'bucketful of questions' ...

Fine. Hope you have more of them in store :)

Regards

Bernard
