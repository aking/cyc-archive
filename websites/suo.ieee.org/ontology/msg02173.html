&gt;Pat,
&gt;  Phooey!  (slightly more mature comments below):

&gt;&gt;&gt;Graham,
&gt;&gt;&gt;I too am dismayed by the volume of discussion and the sense that 
&gt;&gt;&gt;although individual contributors have benefited from the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion, and a rather small group is making progress on an 
&gt;&gt;&gt;ontology, that we're not working together and making collective 
&gt;&gt;&gt;progress on a standard.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Maybe you should learn from this observation, rather than regretting it.
&gt;
&gt;Just because we haven't yet found success is no reason to think it 
&gt;impossible.  What lesson would you have me learn, and how should 
&gt;that lesson follow from the SUO experience?

That there are genuinely divergent and incompatible views on many 
ontological issues, and that consensus cannot be achieved by any 
simplistic approach of trying to merge or conflate them by simply 
inserting them into a single overarching classification. That 
reconciliations between divergent views are best achieved by looking 
for mutually acceptable mappings between them, rather than by 
choosing one over the other.  That a generally useful ontological 
classification should be based on an attempt to discover orthogonal 
categories from which a useful lattice can be constructed, rather 
than on an ad-hoc initial tree, no matter how carefully based on some 
philosophical agenda.
All of which, by the way, we concluded in 1998 in Heidelberg.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe that the solution is not improved document management or 
&gt;&gt;&gt;better tools but rather for folks to be specific and concrete in 
&gt;&gt;&gt;developing a formal document expressing their preferred version of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;an upper ontology.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think it is simply a reflection of a fact of life: people do not 
&gt;&gt;agree on ontological issues. They never have and they never will. 
&gt;&gt;Regretting this is like regretting that people speak different 
&gt;&gt;languages. My mum is sternly disapproving of the fact there there 
&gt;&gt;are people on the planet who don't naturally speak the Queen's 
&gt;&gt;English, an attitude that rather reminds me of yours towards the 
&gt;&gt;variety displayed on this very list.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Don't you think that a better attitude to this fact might be to 
&gt;&gt;find a way to utilize it, rather than try to 'solve' the 'problem'?
&gt;
&gt;Not at all.  People disagree when there is reason to do so,

People disagree for all kinds of reasons. I don't think the 
disagreements that have been revealed on the SUO list arise from any 
*need* to disagree. They arise from genuinely divergent, often deeply 
felt, convictions about the nature of reality, the appropriate way to 
describe it, and so on. You seem curiously unable to appreciate that 
there even are such differences.

Maybe it would help if you were to state explicitly what your basic 
assumptions are about the SUO and the methodology that you and Ian 
are adopting towards creating it. For example, you seem to assume 
that all reasonable people can be made to agree, or at least their 
axioms can be. Do you think this is correct? (If so, why?) You 
sometimes seem to think that just by translating axioms into a common 
logical notation, they will somehow come to be mutually compatible. 
You seem to think that the exact definitions of the terms in the 
concept heirarchy are not all that important, and are really only 
hooks to hang things on. Are all these impressions correct?

&gt;and find ways of agreeing when there is reason to do so.  In the KIF 
&gt;working group we have a compelling need to agree on a common 
&gt;language and semantics for the language.  We might each have our 
&gt;preferences, but we're willing to give up certain preferences here 
&gt;and there in order to reach consensus.

Well, you introduced the example, so let me respond. First, KIF is a 
language, not an ontology, so there is lot less to disagree about. 
Even in that severely limited domain, and that relatively small 
group, we managed to discover at least three basic, irreconcileable 
differences in viewpoints, as you may recall. We have indeed managed 
to find a route through this particular minefield, but only with the 
greatest care and by some of the group agreeing to bow out of the 
discussion and leave it to a smaller subgroup to thrash out the 
details. And only 2 weeks ago, we discovered that we had been talking 
at cross purposes over such a basic notion as what constitutes a 
sorted language for the previous six months, and were obliged to 
redefine our overall goals as a result. We once spent several wseeks 
arguing over the exact from of the BNF for 'identifiers'. If the KIF 
group is a microcosm of the SUO effort, then the SUO is doomed.

&gt;We don't all need to agree on every aspect of the SUO.  We merely 
&gt;need to have a product we can accept as a result of a lot of give 
&gt;and take.

The product that Ian is creating will never be acceptable to me, 
under any circumstances. I say this not in any way as a criticism of 
Ians work, but as a comment on the overall methodology. I have tried 
to make my reasons for this as vividly clear as I possibly can, ever 
since I first saw the first draft of the ontology. If you still don't 
understand them then I am at a loss as to how to communicate them to 
you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you believe something specific is lacking in the Merged 
&gt;&gt;&gt;ontology that Ian has been working on, suggest a new axiom, or set 
&gt;&gt;&gt;of terms.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Adam, speaking for myself, the major source of frustration is that 
&gt;&gt;people do not seem to read what one writes. Have you actually 
&gt;&gt;understood anything of what I wrote about what is wrong with the 
&gt;&gt;overall methodology of Niles' effort? It cannot be cured by adding 
&gt;&gt;more bits to it, any more than tossing a few more vegetables into a 
&gt;&gt;stew is going to turn it into a souffle.
&gt;
&gt;I've read your comments and I simply don't agree with your 
&gt;criticisms.  Maybe I don't yet fully understand them.

Well, if you don't agree with them, maybe you could actually answer 
them? Prove me wrong.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If some folks would prefer EXIST or some other basis for the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;standard, then offer concrete extensions to it using the EBNF 
&gt;&gt;&gt;syntax defined for it.  Formalisms without explanation or 
&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion may make it difficult for some folks to communicate but 
&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion without formalisms will lead us simply to more talk.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I would like to applaud those folks who have been very concrete 
&gt;&gt;&gt;(and forgive me for those who I have forgotten): Helena Sofia 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Pinto for contributing an ontology of units and measures, Nicola 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Guarino and his colleagues for their work on mereology, Pat Hayes 
&gt;&gt;&gt;for his detailed and specific help on temporal axioms, Chris 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Menzel, David Whitten and Robert Kent for their work on the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;"structural ontology". We should also thank John Sowa, Achille 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Varzi, Roberto Casati, James Allen, Barry Smith, Stuart Russell, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Peter Norvig and all the unattributed contributors to the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Ontolingua repository.
&gt;&gt;&gt;If everyone on this list would create just some small ontology of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;even a dozen terms supported by axioms that has not yet been 
&gt;&gt;&gt;covered in the merged ontology, we could make tremendous progress.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;No, we would simply have a larger and even more confused stew. The 
&gt;&gt;axiomatizations would be incompatiable with each other and would be 
&gt;&gt;based on sharply different views of the world. Surely this is 
&gt;&gt;vividly clear from the postings on this list? Matthew West's axioms 
&gt;&gt;would talk of 4-d entities and be based on a solid physical 
&gt;&gt;nominalism; Lee Auspitz' axioms would assume a tensed ontology and 
&gt;&gt;would take human experiences as their basic framework. Others would 
&gt;&gt;write axioms which transliterate one of several different kinds of 
&gt;&gt;English grammatical theory. We even seem to disagree on what words 
&gt;&gt;like 'set' and 'class' mean.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You have thanked me for my contribution on temporal axioms, but I 
&gt;&gt;wish you would not, since I regard the temporal axioms in Niles' 
&gt;&gt;document as a crock, and would refer that my name not be associated 
&gt;&gt;with them. There is no single generally useful axiomatization of 
&gt;&gt;time: that is why I wrote a temporal CATALOG, setting out the 
&gt;&gt;ALTERNATIVES and noting the ways they were INCOMPATIBLE with each 
&gt;&gt;other. I did that for a reason, not because I couldnt think of 
&gt;&gt;anything else.
&gt;
&gt;We may disagree on English terms but I'm not clear on which axioms 
&gt;you disagree with.

Asking me to disagree with individual axioms is like answering 
someone who criticises Windows 98 to cite a particular line of code 
they don't like. It just misses the point. Its not that I disagree 
with any axioms in particular, but that they disagree with each other.

Look, surely it is obvious that one cannot expect, just because 
people are using a common logical langauge, that they are 
automatically agreeing with each other? On what grounds would you 
*expect* to be able to 'merge' ontologies written by different people 
about different subject-matters, with different philosophical or 
pragmatic or mathematical agendas, so that they fit together into one 
framework? This entire ambition strikes me as close to insane. Is 
your experience of the world really so limited that you have never 
come across divergent points of view? I managed to find about 20 or 
so incompatible points of view just on temporal orderings.

Let me turn the point around. Show me some nontrivial consequence of 
the axioms in the merged ontology that you think illustrates its 
utility, and that uses axioms from several different sources. Let me 
give you an example to get things started: try inferring that if 
there is a hole and that some fluid stuff is moving into the hole and 
the hole doesn't get smaller, then the stuff must be going somewhere. 
That should involve holes, time and fluids, and maybe pathways.
Or take a few combined concepts. Suppose that someone wants to 
describe a subclass of human beings, those who are related to a 
British citizen in some way that gives them the right of abode in the 
UK (a *very* sensitive issue in UK politics, by the way). What kind 
of ontological description would be used to describe such a class? 
(The legal definition was changed a number of times, so that the 
answer is highly connected with the time the request was made. Just a 
heads-up about the kind of issues that are going to come up.) Heres 
another: the notion of an insult. What *kind* of thing is an insult? 
Which hook would you suggest hanging it on? (Similarly 
slander/libel/offense/apology...)

&gt; In fact, although you've said often that you consider the current 
&gt;merged ontology "incoherent" or, as above, that there are sections 
&gt;that are "incompatible" with one another, I don't believe you've 
&gt;given a precise characterization of what you mean by those words.

I can't give you a LOGICAL definition. What I meant is that various 
parts of the ontology are written with different, and incompatible, 
assumptions in mind. The 'foralls' in one part of the ontology range 
over different universes than those in other parts, for example. I 
have already documented several of these cases, but the point is that 
with this methodology such clashes are inevitable.

I have another problem with the current merged ontology, which is 
that its basic class distinctions don't make sense to me and aren't 
properly documented,and seem to form a tree, which is wildly 
unsuitable for any complex reasoning. I notice however that you have 
a much more casual, ready-to-hand attitude to conceptual 
classification than I am comfortable with. You use "Sign", for 
example, in ways that would I suspect make a true-born P**rcian 
cringe (whatever it is, it is inherently triadic, so classifying a 
novel as an instance of Sign has got to be a mistake. Maybe one 
particular event of reading a novel might qualify?), although as I 
have no idea what it means I am not really qualified to judge. On the 
other hand, I will never, to my dying day, use an ontology that 
requires me to categorize Hamlet as an instance of Sign.

&gt; Do you mean that the current ontology is logically inconsistent? 
&gt;If so, let me issue a friendly challenge: show a proof using the 
&gt;axioms in the merged ontology which leads to a contradiction.  Let 
&gt;me issue an even stronger challenge since if there are in fact any 
&gt;contradictions I suspect we can fix them

That is like saying that if I find any holes in the airplane you can 
patch them.  Even if it were true, it doesnt make for good 
engineering.

&gt;: show two proofs leading to contractions for which any fixes would 
&gt;generate more contradictions.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;This could also include domain-specific ontologies as the exercise 
&gt;&gt;&gt;of linking such ontologies to the merged ontology will elucidate 
&gt;&gt;&gt;the general areas that need to be developed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;How about a practical semiotics of books, recordings and documents;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Would it take a book to be a semiotic text with a physical 
&gt;&gt;encoding, or a physical object (a continuant or a 4-d lifetime?) to 
&gt;&gt;which contentful relations can be applied, or a kind of 'sum' of a 
&gt;&gt;physical entity plus a nonphysical 'text', or a collection (what 
&gt;&gt;kind of collection?) of surfaces bearing information-encoding 
&gt;&gt;marks, or...? (Please don't say 'all of these') Some people think 
&gt;&gt;of books as things with a history, like old furniture.
&gt;
&gt;These are exactly the sort of questions the author of an ontology of 
&gt;semiotics should ask, and answer.

On what grounds should they be answered one way rather than another? 
All are perfectly fine answers, for some purposes. A book is one 
thing to a bookbinder, another to a librarian, another to a 
publisher, and still another to a copyright lawyer, and yet something 
else to a freight line operator. None of them are *right* and the 
others *wrong*. They are all perfectly good, but subtly incompatible, 
views.

&gt; That they have not been answered in this discussion group should 
&gt;not suggest that they can't be answered satisfactorily.  Since 
&gt;you've asked, let me attempt an answer.

Im sure that an answer CAN be given. My point is that other answers 
can also be given, and the SUO cannot possibly legislate some out of 
court and others in.

&gt; I'll call on Ian to correct any erroneous connections that I may 
&gt;make with the merged ontology (given below as a term with an initial 
&gt;capital).
&gt;
&gt;A book is a physical object with a lifetime - subclass of VariableObject

Why  Variable?

&gt;A book is related to the "conceptual work" which is the information 
&gt;content of the text in the book.

What about encyclopedias, collections of poetry, dictionaries, and diaries?

&gt;A conceptual work is a ContentBearingObject (it may more 
&gt;specifically be a Sign).

I think this is wrong, since a ContentBearingObject is a physical 
entity which also bears information (last time I checked).

&gt;A conceptual work has temporal extent, at least one author, and no 
&gt;physical extent.

Not all works have authors.

&gt;A particular coding of the conceptual work is also a Sign.
&gt;A book contains a particular coding of the conceptual work.

What distinguishes a book from a videotape or a CD?
