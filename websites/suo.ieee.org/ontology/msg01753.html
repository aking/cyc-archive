Dear Jon,

&gt; In my experience, however, most people will eventually settle on
&gt; either one of two different notions of reducibility as capturing
&gt; what they have in mind, namely:
&gt; 
&gt;    1.  Compositive Reduction
&gt;    2.  Projective Reduction

As far as I can make out neither of these are what I consider I do
or what Pat has described. So any arguments about them are largely
irrelevant to what I might want to say on the subject.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; "Reductions Among Relations" (RAR) Interest Group:
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the carded out and less tangled up braiding
&gt; of the threads that we wove on this theme last Fall,
&gt; as I promised, or maybe you thought threadend y'all.
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Note 1
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some notes on the topic of
&gt; "Reductions Among Relations" (RAR).
&gt; 
&gt; One of the things that makes the general problem of RAR seem
&gt; just a little bit ill-defined is that you would have to survey
&gt; all of the conceivable ways of "getting new relations from old"
&gt; just to say what you mean by "L is reducible to {L&lt;j&gt; : j in J}",
&gt; in other words, that if you had a set of "simpler" relations L&lt;j&gt;,
&gt; for indices j in some set J, that this data would somehow fix
&gt; the original relation L that you are seeking to analyze,
&gt; to determine, to specify, to synthesize, or whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; In my experience, however, most people will eventually settle on
&gt; either one of two different notions of reducibility as capturing
&gt; what they have in mind, namely:
&gt; 
&gt;    1.  Compositive Reduction
&gt;    2.  Projective Reduction
&gt; 
&gt; As it happens, there is an interesting relationship between these
&gt; two notions of reducibility, the implications of which I am still
&gt; in the middle of studying, so I will try to treat them in tandem.
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Note 2
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; I will start out with the notion of "projective reduction"
&gt; of relations, in part because it is easier and much more
&gt; intuitive (in the visual sense), but also because there
&gt; are a number of tools that we need for the other brand
&gt; of reduction that arise quite naturally as a part of
&gt; the projective setting.
&gt; 
&gt; Before we get into the operational machinery and the
&gt; vocational vocabulary of it all, let me just suggest
&gt; that you keep in mind the following sort of picture,
&gt; which pretty much says it all, in that reducing the
&gt; "motley of the ten thousand terms" (MOTTTT) sort of
&gt; style that the aptest genres and the fittest motifs
&gt; of representations are genreally found to exhibit.
&gt; 
&gt; Picture a k-adic relation L as a body
&gt; that resides in k-dimensional space X.
&gt; If the dimensions are X&lt;1&gt;, ..., X&lt;k&gt;,
&gt; then the "extension" of L, an object
&gt; that I will, for the whole time that
&gt; I am working this "extensional" vein,
&gt; regard as tantamount to the relation
&gt; itself, is a subset of the cartesian
&gt; product space  X = X&lt;1&gt; x ... x X&lt;k&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; If you pick out your favorite family F of domains
&gt; among these dimensions, say, X&lt;F&gt; = {X&lt;j&gt; : j in F},
&gt; then the "projection" of a point x in X on the subspace
&gt; that gets "generated" along these dimensions of X&lt;F&gt; can
&gt; be denoted by the notation "Proj&lt;F&gt;&lt;x&gt;".
&gt; 
&gt; By extension, the projection of any relation L on that subspace
&gt; is denoted by "Proj&lt;F&gt;&lt;L&gt;", or still more simply, by "Proj&lt;F&gt;L".
&gt; 
&gt; The question of "projective reduction" for k-adic relations
&gt; can be stated with moderate generality in the following way:
&gt; 
&gt; | Given a set of k-place relations in the same space X and
&gt; | a set of projections from X to the associated subspaces,
&gt; | do the projections afford sufficient data to tell the
&gt; | different relations apart?
&gt; 
&gt; Next time, in order to make this discussion more concrete,
&gt; I will focus on some examples of triadic relations.  In fact,
&gt; to start within the bounds of no doubt familiar examples by now,
&gt; I will begin with the examples of sign relations that I used before.

&gt; Note 3
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Projective Reduction of Triadic Relations
&gt; 
&gt; We are ready to take up the question of whether
&gt; 3-adic relations, in general, and in particular
&gt; cases, are "determined by", "reducible to", or
&gt; "reconstructible from" their 2-adic projections.
&gt; 
&gt; Suppose that L contained in XxYxZ is an arbitrary 3-adic relation,
&gt; and consider the three 2-adic relations that are gotten by taking
&gt; its projections, its "shadows", if you will, on each of the three
&gt; planes XY, XZ, YZ.  Using the notation that I introduced before,
&gt; and compressing it just a bit or two in passing, one can write
&gt; these projections in each of the following ways, depending on
&gt; which turns out to be most convenient in a given context:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Proj&lt;{X,Y}&gt;&lt;L&gt; = Proj&lt;{1,2}&gt;&lt;L&gt; = Proj&lt;XY&gt;L = Proj&lt;12&gt;L = 
&gt; L&lt;XY&gt; = L&lt;12&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Proj&lt;{X,Z}&gt;&lt;L&gt; = Proj&lt;{1,3}&gt;&lt;L&gt; = Proj&lt;XZ&gt;L = Proj&lt;13&gt;L = 
&gt; L&lt;XZ&gt; = L&lt;13&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Proj&lt;{Y,Z}&gt;&lt;L&gt; = Proj&lt;{2,3}&gt;&lt;L&gt; = Proj&lt;YZ&gt;L = Proj&lt;23&gt;L = 
&gt; L&lt;YZ&gt; = L&lt;23&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; If you picture the relation L as a body in the 3-space XYZ, then
&gt; the issue of whether L is "reducible to" or "reconstuctible from"
&gt; its 2-adic projections is just the question of whether these three
&gt; projections, "shadows", or "2-faces" determine the body L uniquely.
&gt; 
&gt; Stating the matter the other way around, L is "not reducible to"
&gt; or "not reconstructible from" its 2-dim projections if &amp; only if
&gt; there are two distinct relations L and L' which have exactly the
&gt; same projections on exactly the same planes.
&gt; 
&gt; The next series of Tables illustrates the projection operations
&gt; by means of their actions on the sign relations L(A) and L(B)
&gt; that I introduced earlier on, in the "Sign Relations" thread.
&gt; Recall that we had the following set-up:
&gt; 
&gt; | L(A) and L(B) are "contained in" or "subsets of" OxSxI:
&gt; |
&gt; | O  =  {A, B},
&gt; |
&gt; | S  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"},
&gt; |
&gt; | I  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"}.
&gt; 
&gt; | L(A) has the following eight triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; in OxSxI:
&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A", "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "i", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B", "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "u", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; | L(B) has the following eight triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; in OxSxI:
&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A", "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "u", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B", "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "i", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Taking the 2-adic projections of L(A)
&gt; we obtain the following set of data:
&gt; 
&gt; | L(A)&lt;OS&gt; has these four triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;o, s&gt; in OxS:
&gt; | 
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "u"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; | L(A)&lt;OI&gt; has these four triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;o, i&gt; in OxI:
&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "u"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; | L(A)&lt;SI&gt; has these eight triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;s, i&gt; in SxI:
&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;"A", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"A", "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"i", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"i", "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"B", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"B", "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"u", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"u", "u"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Taking the dyadic projections of L(B)
&gt; we obtain the following set of data:
&gt; 
&gt; | L(B)&lt;OS&gt; has these four triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;o, s&gt; in OxS:
&gt; | 
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "i"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; | L(B)&lt;OI&gt; has these four triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;o, i&gt; in OxI:
&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;A, "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;A, "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;B, "i"&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; | L(B)&lt;SI&gt; has these eight triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;s, i&gt; in SxI:
&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;"A", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"A", "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"u", "A"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"u", "u"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"B", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"B", "i"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"i", "B"&gt;
&gt; |    &lt;"i", "i"&gt;
&gt;  
&gt; A comparison of the corresponding projections for L(A) and L(B)
&gt; reveals that the distinction between these two 3-adic relations
&gt; is preserved under the operation that takes the full collection
&gt; of 2-adic projections into consideration, and this circumstance
&gt; allows one to say that this much information, that is, enough to
&gt; tell L(A) and L(B) apart, can be derived from their 2-adic faces.
&gt; 
&gt; However, in order to say that a 3-adic relation L on OxSxI
&gt; is "reducible" or "reconstructible" in the 2-dim projective
&gt; sense, it is necessary to show that no distinct L' on OxSxI
&gt; exists such that L and L' have the same set of projections,
&gt; and this can take a rather more exhaustive or comprehensive
&gt; investigation of the space of possible relations on OxSxI.
&gt; 
&gt; As it happens, each of the relations L(A) and L(B) turns
&gt; out to be uniquely determined by its 2-dim projections.
&gt; This can be seen as follows.  Consider any coordinate
&gt; position &lt;s, i&gt; in the plane SxI.  If &lt;s, i&gt; is not
&gt; in L&lt;SI&gt; then there can be no element &lt;o, s, i&gt; in L,
&gt; therefore we may restrict our attention to positions
&gt; &lt;s, i&gt; in L&lt;SI&gt;, knowing that there exist at least
&gt; |L&lt;SI&gt;| = Cardinality of L&lt;SI&gt; = 8 elements in L,
&gt; and seeking only to determine what objects o exist
&gt; such that &lt;o, s, i&gt; is an element in the objective
&gt; "fiber" of &lt;s, i&gt;.  In other words, for what o in O
&gt; is &lt;o, s, i&gt; in ((Proj&lt;SI&gt;)^(-1))(&lt;s, i&gt;)?  Now, the
&gt; circumstance that L&lt;OS&gt; has exactly one element &lt;o, s&gt;
&gt; for each coordinate s in S and that L&lt;OI&gt; has exactly
&gt; one element &lt;o, i&gt; for each coordinate i in I, plus
&gt; the "coincidence" of it being the same o at any one
&gt; choice for &lt;s, i&gt;, tells us that L has just the one
&gt; element &lt;o, s, i&gt; over each point of SxI.  Together,
&gt; this proves that both L(A) and L(B) are reducible in
&gt; an informative sense to 3-tuples of 2-adic relations,
&gt; that is, they are "projectively 2-adically reducible".
&gt; 
&gt; Next time I will give examples of 3-adic relations
&gt; that are not reducible to or reconstructible from
&gt; their 2-adic projections.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meantime, try to contain yourselves.
