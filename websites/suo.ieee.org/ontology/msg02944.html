&gt; Hi Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin Johnson previously]
&gt; You generally attack the paradox 'information theoretically'
&gt; (holding  'time' 'constant' (as a pivot of reason) and
&gt; allowing 'space' to 'vary').

Here I do not understand your language, in particular:

1.  &quot;attack the paradox&quot; -- I see no paradox to attack.

2.  &quot;information theoretically&quot; -- I am interested in the integral
    interweave of indication, inference, information, and inquiry,
    but I am not invoking any specifically &quot;information theoretic&quot;
    issues at the present juncture.

3.  &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot; -- I do not see these as relevant dimensions
    in the present, almost purely &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;semiotic&quot; concerns.

4.  &quot;pivot of reason&quot; -- ???

&gt; 'Information theoretic' arguments are equipotent with 'logical' arguments
&gt; (though the proponent of one or another particular instantiation may be
&gt; unwilling to grant this at some particular moment in time ;-).

Again, I am only talking logic, maybe a bit of semiotic.

&gt; [Jon Awbrey]
&gt; I am not sure I get what you are saying here --
&gt; my analysis of this particular problem shows
&gt; that a fast one has been pulled, and that no
&gt; anomaly actually arises, if the eye is quick
&gt; enough to catch it before the initial action --
&gt; but what you say reminds me of the old theme
&gt; from Charles Sanders Peirce, of late revived
&gt; by George Spencer Brown, that nothing in the
&gt; world says we cannot invent imaginary values
&gt; in logic that will act in analogue to values
&gt; of that ilk already familiar in mathematics.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; I am just saying that it is possible for ‘logical’
&gt; and ‘information theoretic’ arguments to attack
&gt; one another with equal warrant under formal
&gt; human reason.

Again, I do not understand this talk of arguments attacking one another.

&gt; I am subsuming a spatio-temporal universe of discourse
&gt; to yield ‘space’ and ‘time’ as pivots of reason.  This is
&gt; simply a pragmatic acknowledgment of the primary stature
&gt; of these ‘dimensions’ in philosophy, mathematics, etc.
&gt; [Other lists have people discussing ‘time’ ostensibly
&gt; without using ‘time’.  I don’t have a difficulty with
&gt; that because it simply adds another pivot for formal
&gt; reason.]

This is the same language that I did not understand the first time.

&gt; The ‘catching of a fast one’ is a process that can spiral
&gt; indefinitely though what appears to happen is the two sides
&gt; wearying of the battle/inquiry and moving on to another topic.
&gt; This may or may not result in statements like “the majority of
&gt; rational people agree that ____” or “the majority of logicians
&gt; agree that _____.”
&gt; 
&gt; Per Peirce and Brown, I would only remember that
&gt; our formal understanding of what mathematics is,
&gt; is also limited -– in my opinion.

It is limited.  It is not zero.

&gt; A ‘fast one’ would be to ascribe to an incomplete understanding/conception
&gt; of mathematics the position of ultimate arbiter, i.e. smuggling in the very
&gt; limitations it presumes to judge.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon previously]
&gt; Just here, to wit, where it is writ:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1.  Statement 1 is false.
&gt; 
&gt; What is this really saying?
&gt; Well, it's the same as writing:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Statement 1.  Statement 1 is false.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin previously]
&gt; This is an information theoretic expansion of a term.
&gt; The warrant is similar to the justification behind
&gt; calling 1/2 and 3/6 equivalent and/or a simplified
&gt; expression in mathematics (clearing redundant terms,
&gt; etc.).
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; I think of it as a semantic equivalence.
&gt; The question is simply whether the line
&gt; |
&gt; | 1.  Statement 1 is false.
&gt; |
&gt; is written with the intention of stating that
&gt; what its intender calls by the name &quot;Statement 1&quot; and
&gt; what its intender writes out as &quot;Statement 1 is false&quot;
&gt; are intended to be the same statement or not.  If not,
&gt; all bets are off, and the author of the line is left
&gt; to clarify the intention of the writ, to wit, &quot;S_0&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; I appreciate and understand your attack.
&gt; I am simply pointing out a pivot of its reason.

???

&gt; [Jon previously]
&gt; And what the heck does this dot.comment say?
&gt; It is inducing you to accept this identity:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Statement 1 is false&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; That appears to be a purely syntactic indexing,
&gt; the sort of thing you are led to believe that
&gt; you can do arbitrarily, with logical impunity.
&gt;  
&gt; [Kevin previously]
&gt; Logic's metalanguage relies on this same impunity.
&gt; Pot calling the kettle black.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; I think not.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; We are discussing it, are we not?

I do not understand what you are saying here.
Perhaps it would help if I rephrase my claim:

| Just here, to wit, where it is writ:
| |
| | 1.  Statement 1 is false.
| |
| What is this really saying?
| Well, it's the same as writing:
| |
| | Statement 1.  Statement 1 is false.
| |
| And what the heck does this dot.comment say?

| | 
| That appears to be a purely syntactic indexing,
| the sort of thing you are led to believe that
| you can do arbitrarily, with logical impunity.

People seem to think that the mere listing, naming,
or numbering of logical expressions are operations
that have no logical consequences, as if they fell
outside the jurisdiction of logical laws, and must
be innocent of any offense against reason, however
they operate, and no matter how they are conducted.
That would amount to a &quot;purely syntactic indexing&quot;,
executable willy nilly, or with &quot;logical impunity&quot;.
But semiotics is the ground over which logic walks,
so a fault in semiotics makes for a quake in logic.

&gt; [Jon previously]
&gt; &gt; &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Negation of Statement 1&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin previously] 
&gt; This also touches on the underlying ambiguity of 'negation' in reasoning.
&gt; A difficulty for hereditary warrants of consistency.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; I am classical.
&gt; Negation is my middle name.
&gt; It's just not that big a deal.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; The foundational ambiguity of a primary logical operator is of some concern to me.

Be not afraid.
There is no ambiguity to speak of here.

&gt; [Jon previously]
&gt; To write the last step in the form that I like:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (( Statement_1 , ( Statement_1 ) ))
&gt; 
&gt; And this my friends, call it &quot;Statement 0&quot;,
&gt; is purely and simply a false statement,
&gt; with no hint of paradox about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Statement 0 was slipped into your drink
&gt; before you were even starting to think.
&gt; A bit before you were led to substitute
&gt; you should have examined more carefully
&gt; the site proposed for the substitution!
&gt; 
&gt; For the principle that you rushed to use
&gt; does not permit you to substitute unequals
&gt; into a statement that is false to begin with,
&gt; not just in the first place, but even before,
&gt; in the zeroth place of argument, as it were,
&gt; and still expect to come up with a truth.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin previously]
&gt; The argument can also be made that you used this same device to argue against itself.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; I think not.
&gt; I am pointing to a very simple mistake.
&gt; Substituting into a false statement just
&gt; cannot be guaranteed to create any truth.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; I think this situation is common enough to have its own principle:  charity.

Is it charity to leave a person locked
in anxious chains of their own forging?

T^2:  &quot;What's love got to do with it?&quot;

&gt; You interpret the paradox uncharitably.

There is no paradox to interpret.

&gt; [Kevin previously]
&gt; It is easy to see why such statements are/were brushed
&gt; aside with terms like 'non-sensical'.  Confronting them
&gt; illuminates disturbing limitations in formal reasoning.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; As long as you take the statement &quot;S = Not S&quot; to be false,
&gt; and just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic,
&gt; you cannot imagine any substitution for S to make it true.
&gt;
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; ‘any substitution for S’

JA: &quot;just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic&quot;

&gt; I have a fairly good imagination.

So?  How does that apply here?

&gt; [Kevin previously]
&gt; Note also that you wish to explicitly inject 'variance' of 'time' into an argument
&gt; that depends upon a warrant of consistency at a single moment in 'time', i.e., you
&gt; wish to establish a temporal ordering of events upon which the principle can take
&gt; hold.

I do not recall doing any such thing.
Can you point to where I &quot;explicitly
inject 'variance' of 'time'&quot; within
the original discussion?

&gt; You illuminate a/the weakness of 'logical' arguments.

As opposed to the strength of illogical arguments?

&gt; In this it can also be seen that 'logic' and 'information theory'
&gt; subsume one another.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; These considerations are irrelevant.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; They would not be irrelevant in situations where the ambiguity
&gt; encrypted in the reasoning masks ambiguity in the referents. 
&gt; This can also have not so benign applications.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon previously]
&gt; Now, let that be the end of that.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin previously] 
&gt; To me, the important thing is to recognize that human formal reasoning has limitations.

It has its peculiar limitations.  But that does not make it non-existent.
It would become useless if arguments from false premisses are encouraged.

&gt; You need to 'step back' from the circularity and see that for what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; There is no circularity here.
&gt; It is a simple logical error.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; Again, I acknowledge that it can be interpreted that way and usefully too.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin previously]
&gt; There is value in exploring and developing arabesques and paths within that circle --
&gt; I have no doubt-of/qualms-with that -- but I think there is danger in hypostatizing
&gt; its universe of discourse 'universally' outside the circle of application (claiming
&gt; its complement might be a way to look at -- this reminds me that I saw an expression
&gt; for the axiom of infinity that essentially/explicitly uses this notion of claiming
&gt; its complement).
&gt;
&gt; [Jon]
&gt; It's simply a matter of economy in ammunition:
&gt; Elephant guns are not needed to swat this bug.
&gt; 
&gt; [Kevin]
&gt; 
&gt; Danger comes in packages large and small.

There is a passel of mystification in packaging.
But there be rules about truth in animadverting.
