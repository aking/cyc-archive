Dear Jon,

&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; I am still looking for easy ways to explain what's wrong with
&gt; this purported "analysis", "definition", "transliteration", or
&gt; whatever.  The reason why it is important no longer has anything
&gt; to do with triadicity specifically, but now has to do with whether
&gt; posterity will judge the SUO group as having understood even so much
&gt; as what a relation or a tuple is.  At the present time that question
&gt; is seriously in doubt.  Yes, of course, people are able to recite
&gt; the phrase that "a relation is a set of tuples", but whether they
&gt; can follow up any significant number of the consequences of that
&gt; token tenet, and whether they can recognize a tuple in many of
&gt; its sundry disguises, those are different questions altogether.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, while I was pondering, weak and weary, this whole problematic
&gt; scene, I happened to recall a sort of a pedagogical moment from my own
&gt; education that I thought might serve as a generic brand of anecdote,
&gt; bringing perhaps a little bit of illumination on the present case.
&gt; 
&gt; In the subject of Real Analysis, one is concerned
&gt; with spaces and functions of the following types:
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; |  Dimension    |  Space        |  Function     |
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; |  1            |  R^1 = R      |  R^1 -&gt; R     |
&gt; |  2            |  R^2 = RxR    |  R^2 -&gt; R     |
&gt; |  3            |  R^3 = RxRxR  |  R^3 -&gt; R     |
&gt; |  ...          |  ...          |  ...          |
&gt; |  n            |  R^n          |  R^n -&gt; R     |
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Now, it is typical to begin with the one-dimensional case
&gt; and gradually to work toward the multi-dimensional setting.
&gt; In referring to the elements of R and mappings from R to R,
&gt; one naturally uses notations like "x in R",  "f : R -&gt; R",
&gt; and the value of f at x is written "f(x)".  So far, so good.
&gt; 
&gt; When one finally arrives at the n-dimensional case, it is
&gt; usual to write things like "x = &lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;&gt;", using
&gt; either the single letter or the coordinate list, depending
&gt; on whichever is convenient at a given moment of discussion.
&gt; 
&gt; But how do you write the value of f at x?  Strictly speaking,
&gt; that is, according to the rulebook of syntactic substitution,
&gt; one ought to write either "f(x)" or "f(&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;&gt;)",
&gt; and when you go through this ringer for the first time, some
&gt; professors will actually insist that you preserve this purity
&gt; of notational discipline, sanctioning "f(x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;)" as
&gt; a vile abuse of notation.  Of course, this degree of pickiness
&gt; will all seem a bit silly, at first and then again a few months
&gt; later when you have much worse problems to worry about, but still,
&gt; experience teaches the experienced teacher that there is a point
&gt; to it.
&gt; 
&gt; Moral Of The Story?  Well, one thing ought to be perfectly clear
&gt; by now to all sensible observers, and that is that the nature and
&gt; the structure of the mathematical object in question, whether it
&gt; is x in R^n or else f : R^n -&gt; R, is not affected one liitle bit
&gt; by the syntactic expression, whatever its structure, that is used
&gt; to refer to it.  And if anybody thinks to make ontological capital
&gt; off the abuse of notation, or the poetic license, that permits us
&gt; to write "f(x, y, z)" instead of "f(&lt;x, y, z&gt;)", or vice versa,
&gt; then that person has another think coming.  The arity of the
&gt; relation is the same either way.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey

1. I agree that if you have some set of binary relations that
essentially define the coordinate positions of components in some
higher arity relation then there is also the higher arity relation.

That was not the issue. Indeed, the axiom that Chris M has put
together on my behalf specifically states this. The issue was whether 
the higher arity relation could be represented by some set of
binary relations. You do not seem to be disputing that this can be done
in the manner I have described. Indeed your argument now seems to be
that it says the same thing (of course it should say the same thing).

2. I understood that a part of your argument was that n-adic relations
could ALWAYS be "decomposed" into triadic relations, but not necessarily
to binary relations. However, following the argument you seem to be
putting forward here, if I have a 4-adic, or 5-adic relation, then
"decomposing" it does not put it out of existence, it only means that it
is implied rather than explicit in some ontology.

This seems to be arguing both ends against the middle to me.

Regards  
      Matthew
