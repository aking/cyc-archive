&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose there is a sort of general,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metalinguistic schema here that exhibits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pattern that any such relation will fit,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something like (ignoring the uniqueness clause
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for brevity):
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (forall (?X1 ... ?Xn)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (REL ?X1 ... ?Xn)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;              (exists (?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (EVENT-TYPE ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (ROLE-1 ?e ?X1)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (ROLE-n ?e ?Xn)))))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But this is pretty useless, as the event types and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corresponding roles for relations still have to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analysed out piecemeal, relation by relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's no general principle or algorithm.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I protest:  this IS a general algorithm, if properly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stated.  The key is not to predicate 'event-type'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the ?e in question, but to connect it to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; original predication of REL, by mapping REL from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an n-ary to a unary relation REL': ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pat, you misunderstand, and please do not place
&gt; &gt; &gt; me in the middle of all this triadicity nonsense.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was only interested, first, in helping Matthew
&gt; &gt; &gt; get clear about the logical form of what he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to assert.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, so was I.  Matthew has been quite clear, I had thought,
&gt; &gt; that the ?e in his example is to be thought of as a n-tuple.
&gt; &gt; Perhaps I had been reading the email deluge too quickly.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Perhaps just a tad.  What I mean is that ?e stands for the
&gt;      same real world thing as the n-tuple.  I would be reluctant
&gt;      to draw from that that the ?e was an n-tuple.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Second, I was interested in the general idea behind Matthew's
&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt -- as a piece of *ontology* -- to flesh out certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; relations in terms of the occurrence of certain events.  Thus,
&gt; &gt; &gt; with regard to what I was doing -- as opposed to what you *thought*
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was doing -- the key is *exactly* the predication of "EVENT-TYPE"
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the ?e in question.  The interesting question for me here was
&gt; &gt; &gt; simply when, if ever, this is a fruitful thing to do, ontologically.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is, when, if ever, is it fruitful to enlarge one's ontology to
&gt; &gt; &gt; encompass events to give a fuller ontological analysis of a given
&gt; &gt; &gt; relation?  *That* is what has to be decided "piecemeal", that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the careful analysis of a class of relations.  I was not talking
&gt; &gt; &gt; about what *can* be done logically -- I have agreed with you from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the beginning of your debate with the triadicians that the algorithm
&gt; &gt; &gt; for translating from n-ary relations to unary and binary relations
&gt; &gt; &gt; is obvious and trivial -- but about whether, when, and how a certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; class of entity might serve some useful ontological purpose.  Ok?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, OK.  But don't you see a rather close parallel here?
&gt; &gt; The difference between writing (EVENT-TYPE ?e) and (R' ?e)
&gt; &gt; doesnt seem to me to be worth making much fuss about,
&gt; &gt; particularly since the 'piecemeal' analysis that would
&gt; &gt; need to be done would presumably establish *some*  kind
&gt; &gt; of connection between the EVENT-TYPE in question and the
&gt; &gt; original REL.  If we utilise the syntactic freedom of revised
&gt; &gt; KIF we could write both of these in the form ((MAPPING REL) ?e)
&gt; &gt; and then just have a side theory about MAPPING, which could be
&gt; &gt; as piecemeal or as uniform as one wanted it to be able to get.
&gt; &gt; Some RELs might satisfy (EVENT-PROPERTY (MAPPING REL)) where
&gt; &gt; (forall (?x ?y)(=&gt; (and (EVENT-PROPERTY ?x)(?x ?y)) (EVENT-TYPE ?y)))
&gt; &gt; while others might not.  But the mapping that Matthew wanted would
&gt; &gt; work smoothly either way:  the ontological status of the value of
&gt; &gt; MAPPING would be an issue which could be discussed separately.

Matthew,

Okay, kibbitzing on this pas de trois has helped me
to see a little more of what's going on here.  I was
going to comment on the details of what I see being
thrashed out here, but I think that I will take the
novel step of following my own advice to others, and
try to take two or three steps back, and speak to the
longer run view of things.

You are to be complimented for your persistence here,
and also for the realistic intuition that is leading
you to recapitulate in your ontogeny many aspects
of the perspective that has been developed in the
phyllogeny of mathematics and its applications to
dynamic systems.  And if anyone is responsible for
the fact that the underlying philosophy and working
attitude of this POV is not more widely appreciated
and recognized for what it is, I guess that I will
have to blame its generations of doctrinarians and
expositors who were apparently so concerned with
the appearances of their outer dress that they
would not dare to show you their workclothes.

Still, I must repeat the suggestion that I have made before,
pointedly on the "Manifolds of Sensuous Impressions" thread,
that the very like of all of these issues have been tackled
before, if perhaps in a deliberately quantitative disguise.

Yes, there are Realities and there are Representations.
Books have been written on the relation between these
two subjects, if not necessarily in that order.

Any Reality to which we are likely to point, appreciated
in all of its glorious splendor, is just bound to be far
more complex and vastly more subtle than the likes of us
fallible and mortal finite information beings could ever
hope to express in full, and so we arch-typically allude
to it under the aegis of "X", our Persean Shield, if you
will.  Here is where, I am beginning to suspect, a brand
of misapprehension first arises between us, for you seem
to advert to this X, arrogated as a realm in reality, or
to its typical element x, conceived as an individual, as
if this move were a simple step, even a simplifying step,
in our approximal approach to the twined reality, x in X.

Well, there is more to talk about here, but maybe I will
stop and check to see whether this accords with what you
see yourself to be doing, as you reflect on your customs.

Happy Monday!

Jon Awbrey
