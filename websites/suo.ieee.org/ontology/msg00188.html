Robert,

Those are four very good questions, each of which could take
a dissertation to answer adequately.  I'll just make some
brief comments about them:

&gt;1. What are the papers that discuss the relationship between Tarski's
&gt;semantics [attached PDF] and Peirce's semiotics
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jzeman/peirces_theory_of_signs.htm">http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jzeman/peirces_theory_of_signs.htm</A> ?

That would require some digging to assemble all the relevant
passages in Peirce's work and the various commentaries about it.
The closest thing to Peirce's version of Tarski's model theory
is what CSP called "endoporeutic" or "outside-in evaluation" of
his existential graphs.  Jaako Hintikka observed that Peirce's
endoporeutic is a variant of what Hintikka called "game
theoretical semantics", which is logically equivalent to the
definition that Tarski gave, but which Hintikka, Barwise,
Etchemendy, and I believe to be a simpler, more elegant
technique, both for theoretical and pedagogical reasons.

Following is a quotation from Peirce (MS 650, p. 18):

   "The interpretation of existential graphs is _endoporeutic_,
   that is, proceeds inwardly; so that a nest sucks the meaning
   from without inwards into its centre, as a sponge absorbs
   water..."

For a brief summary of game theoretical semantics and its
relationship to Tarski's version, see Section 14 of my tutorial
on math &amp; logic:

   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm</A>

I'll send more references in a separate note.  You can also
check the book by Don Roberts, _The Existential Graphs of
Charles S. Peirce_, Mouton, The Hague.  It brings together
a lot of quotations and examples from Peirce about his graphs
and their interpretation by endoporeutic.

&gt;2. More specifically, can we relate (identify in some sense) model-theoretic

&gt;interpretations with sign relations:
&gt;    interpretation corresponds to interpretant
&gt;    constant, function, predicate symbols -- c, f, p -- correspond to signs

&gt;    interpretation images -- I[c], I[f], I[p] -- correspond to objects

Peirce considered his existential graphs to be "icons", in
his sense, of the relationships that are found in some domain
of discourse.  His endoporeutic is a method of evaluating
the truth value of a graph in terms of the truth of the
corresponding relationships in the domain.  In that sense,
it is equivalent to what Tarski was doing. And as Hintikka
and others have shown, Peirce's method generates the same
truth values as Tarski's for equivalent formulas.

To relate signs to signs, Peirce would iterate his triads
in all possible combinations.  For some examples of how such
iterations can be done, see Section 2 of my paper on Ontology,
Metadata, and Semiotics:

   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ontometa.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ontometa.htm</A>

Again, there is a lot more to be said, and if I can find some
appropriate examples and quotations, I'll send them later.

&gt;3. In particular, what is the nature of the interpretation image I[c]? Can

&gt;this be a "real world object", notwithstanding what John says below, in the

&gt;World part of the diagram
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A> , or does it have to be

&gt;a "surrogate" existing in some formal semantic domain? For example, in the

&gt;sentence "John Sowa is less than ten feet tall", can I not define an
&gt;interpretation that maps the string "John Sowa" to the actual individual
&gt;within the domain of actual individual people, or do I need to interpret it

&gt;as some surrogate such as the email address sowa@bestweb.net?

Tarski himself did not apply his version of model theory to
anything but mathematical constructions.  The title of his
most famous paper is "The concept of truth in formalized
languages."  In that paper, he was highly sceptical about the
possibility of extending his approach to natural languages
and to objects in the real world.

Various people who have followed Tarski have applied his
techniques to areas where the master feared to tred.  Some
of them have simply "identified" the elements of Tarski's
abstract sets with "objects" in the world without getting into
the question of how that identification might be carried out.

Peirce himself applied his methods of pragmatism to the issues
of how a correspondence between the world and the elements
of a set might be established, investigated, criticized, etc.
He would allow such an identification to be made, but only if
the reason or purpose for the identification were explicitly
considered and analyzed -- and always with the caveat that a
different mapping between the sets and the world might be
adopted if the purpose happened to change.

Many other logicians, including Barwise and the situation
semantics crowd, have also been critical about a direct
mapping from set-theoretical elements to real world objects.
They have set up various kinds of intermediate structures,
similar to the model that I put in the middle between the
theory and the world.  In Barwise's version, that middle
structure is called an "abstract situation type".

&gt;4. Are sign relations completely relative -- can their objects be thought of

&gt;as signs in a different sign relation? Can the real world objects in the
&gt;diagram above be regarded as signs?

Peirce frequently said that anything could be a sign.  In its
simplest sense, the appearance of something is a sign of its
existence.  The perception of some appearance *as* something
is as Peirce said, an act of abduction, in which the perceiver
makes a leap of faith from the recognition of a few aspects
to a hypothesis that the perceived object has quite a few more
aspects than were actually present in the raw sensory input.
Any input is always sufficient to indicate the existence of
something, but the classification of that something as a dog,
a tree, or a human being is a fallible abduction that could be
mistaken, as in the case of an optical illusion.  The illusion
itself is something, but its interpretation might be mistaken.

Summary:  There is much more to be said.  But in short,
everything and anything can be a sign, and everything that goes
on in the brain (or in a computer) involves signs of signs.
Perception starts as an abduction that interprets raw input in
terms of previously experienced categories.  Thought is a
further development of sign to sign associations, guided by the
neural systems for deduction, induction, and abduction (which,
however, might use methods that are quite different from those
that are presented in textbooks of logic -- but when they are
correct both the neural methods and the textbook methods should
lead to the same result).
