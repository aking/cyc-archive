&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; You wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In EPISTLE we modestly claim that the EPISTLE Core Model can
&gt; &gt; represent "life the universe and everything" (well almost).
&gt; 
&gt; OK, how about the phrase "life, the universe and everything" 
&gt; as another
&gt; "challenge concept"? How would you represent this in EPISTLE? 

MW: Well I guess the simple answer is "thing" our supreme supertype. That of
course is the set of all things, which includes classes and relations and so
on. If you want "life the universe and everything" from the dawn of time to
the end of the universe, then we are talking about that spatio-temporal
extent that is the whole of space for all time, and that is also easy
enough.

&gt; It seems this
&gt; could be interesting... How well can any existing ontology framework
&gt; represent the fullness of this "grand challenge concept", the range of
&gt; things that people think of (or may think of) when they hear the LTUAE
&gt; phrase? (Considering they may think for quite a long time about it..)
&gt; 
&gt; One answer may be that LTUAE refers to the full scope and content of a
&gt; complete ontology itself. In which case the question because, 
&gt; how well can
&gt; the ontology represent itself, and all other possible ontologies?

MW: Well the EPISTLE Core Model does have an ability to model
representations of things, and it can model classes quite generically. It
further allows classification of anything, and supports specialisation
between classes too. So you can go quite a long way. The basic 4D ontology
is explicit.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For some 8 years now I have regularly issued a challenge 
&gt; for people to try
&gt; &gt; to identify things it can't represent (provided you accept the 4D
&gt; paradigm).
&gt; 
&gt; Can you give examples of things that EPISTLE can't represent 
&gt; because they
&gt; are outside the 4D paradigm?

MW: The biggest issue would be representing other paradigms. But then the
model is not really trying to model that. We would expect other paradigms to
be mapped in and out.

MW: Well as I said above, there is nothing to stop you representing other
ontologies in the EPISTLE Core Model. We only use binary relations at
present, and there is no explicit support for concepts like variables, that
can give some difficulties with specifying complex constraints. We do not
major on constraints, another entity relationship limitation.

MW: This is partly about what you are trying to model. The main disadvantage
of an entity relationship language, such as is used to model the ECM is a
disadvantage.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We know were some limits are, but it is quite unusual for 
&gt; anyone to find
&gt; &gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you give us a summary of the limits you currently know 
&gt; of? (That will
&gt; save us time finding them :-)

MW: I think I have.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The worst that has ever happened is I have learnt something.
&gt; 
&gt; That can also be the best that happens :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well that ought to do it ??
&gt; 
&gt; I think so... Presumably, Pat Hayes now has this on his list 
&gt; of things to
&gt; think about :-)
&gt; 
&gt; This is fun -- I haven't typed so many smileys in a while :-)

MW: Yes, when it isn't frustrating.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Phil

&gt; &gt; &gt; RE: RE: RE: Some Procedural Suggestions
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew (and Pat),
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; First, using the Odysseus search page
&gt; &gt; &gt; (<A  HREF="http://odysseus.ieee.org/">http://odysseus.ieee.org/</A>) I answered
&gt; &gt; &gt; my request for more information about EXIST: I found your 
&gt; June 19 2000
&gt; &gt; &gt; posting to SUO which included links to information about EPISTLE
&gt; &gt; &gt; (<A  HREF="http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle">http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle</A>) and the related IIDEAS
&gt; &gt; &gt; effort at
&gt; &gt; &gt; (<A  HREF="http://www.pdtsolutions.co.uk/iideas/">http://www.pdtsolutions.co.uk/iideas/</A>). Following these links at
&gt; &gt; &gt; (<A  HREF="http://www.pdtsolutions.co.uk/iideas/pwi/index.html">http://www.pdtsolutions.co.uk/iideas/pwi/index.html</A>) there
&gt; &gt; &gt; are pointers to
&gt; &gt; &gt; information about the EXIST language, dated May 2, 2000.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, regarding your discussion, separately posted in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; reply to Adam
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pease, of the following "challenge concepts" proposed by 
&gt; Pat Hayes:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an 'information-bearing object' (see my long comment in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recent message);
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a piece of a certain kind of cloth which was used 
&gt; in evidence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a trial;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the color of that piece of cloth;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the act of breaking an egg by hitting it on the side
&gt; &gt; &gt; of a bowl;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a style of dress used by a certain social class in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 17th-century France;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the shape of Marilyn Monroe's left ankle;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cause of the Concorde disaster;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a dish (in the sense that Eggs Benedict is a dish, ie
&gt; &gt; &gt; a something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that could be a menu item; as opposed to any
&gt; &gt; &gt; particular example of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that dish, or the symbols on the menu describing it.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said, I found your discussion of these concepts very
&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting -- the
&gt; &gt; &gt; process of discussing how challenge concepts like these can
&gt; &gt; &gt; be represented
&gt; &gt; &gt; is very helpful, both in testing the representational power of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; ontological framework, and in conveying information to others
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; scope, content, philosophy, etc. of the framework.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; No doubt, there will be a lot more discussion in SUO regarding the
&gt; &gt; &gt; representation of these particular concepts. However, when
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pat originally
&gt; &gt; &gt; posted this list of concepts, he wrote "If you need more, let
&gt; &gt; &gt; me know". I
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope that he (and others) will post more such concepts, to
&gt; &gt; &gt; help further
&gt; &gt; &gt; explore the possibilities for EPISTLE and other ontological
&gt; &gt; &gt; frameworks.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
