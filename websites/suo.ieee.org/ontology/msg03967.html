&gt; BA: Jon, that's a sweeping claim.  And it deserves some substantiation.
&gt;     I've been doing a lot of stuff over my career -- first in AI, and
&gt;     for the past seven years doing DB/ontology work, that works quite
&gt;     &quot;well&quot; and uses the &quot;broken&quot; syntactic variants of FOL.  I'm not
&gt;     the only one.  All database systems in widespread use today are
&gt;     in one way or another based on some variant of FOL (of course
&gt;     the model theories differ substantially).
&gt; 
&gt; No, I was there as these DB systems developed at many sites, and in a
&gt; few of my student jobs I used some of the early ones on real, funded
&gt; &quot;large data base&quot; applied research projects.  In the early days it was
&gt; utter common knowledge that these &quot;Relational Data Base Management
&gt; Systems&quot; (RDBM's) were based on Peirce's &quot;Logic Of Relatives&quot; (LOR).  

Which is just a first-order theory, although it seems to take on
profound significance for you when expressed in Peircean Magickal Syntax
(PMS).  Have a look at, say, Reiter's work on DB theory, relational
calculus, and relational algebras.

&gt; But we are going to have to get a whole lot more concrete as to what
&gt; in the devil we are talking about under the aegis and banner of &quot;FOL&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Go haul out your 'Principia Mathematica'.  That syntax I will call
&gt; &quot;PriMat&quot;.  Sorry for the lack of a brief acronym -- I reserve &quot;PM&quot; for
&gt; Pragmatic Maxim.
&gt; 
&gt; Nobody uses PriMat.  Never did.  Not for real.  

You are obviously confusing the ramified theory of types per se with the
bare syntax of PM.  You are right that virtually no one has ever used
RTT for any real logic or mathematics.  Indeed, it is a disaster for
classical mathematics, as you can't prove many central theorems of, say,
classical analysis.  But the syntax of PM -- for first-order stuff
anyway -- is roughly just the syntax of standard FOL.

&gt; I once took a course
&gt; in mathematical logic from a philosophy department where we started
&gt; with a 1970's upgrade of PriMat, kept in a Zoo for the amusement of
&gt; philosophers, and spent the better part of a semester working our
&gt; way up to proving the PriMat equivalent of &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;.  No joke.
&gt; A task like that is several orders of magnitude worse than doing
&gt; the same thing on a turing machine.

You obviously missed the point.  The logic of PM -- ramified type theory
-- was a *foundational* exercise, and its point was epistemological,
viz., to show that the truths of arithmetic are derivable in principle
from logic.  Your comparison with turing machines is apposite.  No one
*ever* thought that PM would be used to *do* mathematics, any more than
anyone every thought that turing machines would be used to do any
serious programming.  Turing machines give us a clear formal notion of
computability; PM was intended to provide an equally clear demarcation
of legitimate mathematics (this in response to the specter of paradox).
(Note I'm not *defending* PM, just clarifying the point that you
missed.)

&gt; So nobody uses PriMat for any &quot;substantially useful theory routinely
&gt; applied&quot; (SUTRA).  But what they do do with their voodoodoo is this:
&gt; They import a very &quot;particular&quot;, that is to say, a very analytic and
&gt; atomistic &quot;Philosophy Of Logic&quot; (POL) that once got swept through the
&gt; door along with PriMat, and they wrap that atomizer miasma of mist
&gt; around whatever it is that any sensible ordinary person would use to
&gt; do the actual work.  

Rubbish.  Anyone who knows *anything* about FOL knows that it is
absolutely neutral regarding philosophical commitments.  The semantics
requires a nonempty set to quantify over.   That's it.  Done.  That set
can contain physical objects, platonic objects, classes, angels, gods,
and demons, whatever you like to suit your metaphysical predilections.

&gt; And then whatever staged wonder that they manage to perform by means
&gt; of the means that really do the trick, they attribute to the almighty
&gt; mystical powers of this PriMat POL.

You are arguing against a strawman of your own creation.

&gt; BA: That said, you may certainly be correct in saying that there is a
&gt; better syntax out there.  But why all the diatribe?  Why not just come
&gt; out and say that's where your concern lies?  It only takes a sentence
&gt; or two.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been doing that here, a sentence or two or three at a time, for
&gt; two years.

Except that your arguments -- when you give them -- are utterly
uncompelling, except perhaps to the True Believers, and have been
exposed as such on numerous occasions.

&gt; BA: I will even grant that to some extent.  But why not just propose
&gt; some alternative that you think will work better rather than directing
&gt; desultory shotgun blasts at FOL?  That would make for much more
&gt; entertaining (and useful) reading for me anyway!
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I've been doing that, one alternative at a time, for a lifetime.
&gt; One, FOL itself is not something that you can point a phaser at.  Two,
&gt; whenever I point a critique at a concrete detail of syntax, folks wrap
&gt; themselves in banners or cloaks of &quot;abstract ideals&quot;, 

Which seems to be your only interpretation of any disagreement with your
views.

&gt; and disappear from the scene of pragmatic computational reality.

Ironic that you should give this response to Bill, one of the few people
working in ontology who is actually involved in writing real programs
that do something -- working strongly within the FOL tradition, as it
happens.  Bill is simply tiring of your endless tirades when they appear
to have no concrete upshot, and is requesting, kindly, that you provide
some evidence to the contrary.
