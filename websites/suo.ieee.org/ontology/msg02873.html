John,

&gt; One of my main reasons for objecting to the terms "regular" and
&gt; "irregular" is that almost all concepts are irregular, and the
&gt; regular ones are highly artificial.

Thanks for restating this point -- I am not sure I agree with it, entirely.
I think that many important concepts are regular, and are not entirely
artificial, but reflect important properties of the real world. I agree with
your point however, that regular concepts are formalized within theories.

A discussion that I find very reasonable is given in the paper I cited by
Pinker and Prince. To do justice to their analysis, I need to present an
extended quotation:

========================================
"No two objects are exactly alike. So why do we use conceptual categories?
Why don't we treat every object as the unique individual that it is? And why
do we form the categories we do? Why lump together salmon, minnow and
sharks, as opposed to sharks, leaves and spaghetti? [...] categories are
useful because they allow us to infer objects' unobserved characteristics
from their observed properties [...] Though we cannot know everything about
an object, we can observe some things; the observed properties allow us to
assign the object to a category, and the structure of the category then
allows us to infer the values of the object's unobserved properties. [...]We
can get away with certain inductive leaps based on categories only because
the world works in certain ways. Objects are not randomly distributed
through the multidimensional space of properties that humans are interested
in; they cluster in regions of co-ocurring properties that Bobick calls
"natural modes" and Shepard calls "consequential regions". These modes are
the result of the laws of form and function that govern the processes that
create and preserve objects."
[...]
"this raises the question of what kinds of regularities in the world are the
result of scientific and mathematical laws (e.g. of physics, geometry,
physiology). Laws can be captured in formal systems, given a suitable
idealization of the world. [...] Formal systems, we suggest, are the
contexts in which classical categories are defined. Therefore, under
whatever idealization of the world a set of scientific or mathematical laws
applies, the world contains classical categories. For example, when the
texture, material, thickness, and microscopically ragged edges of real-world
objects are provisionally ignored, some can be idealized as plane geometry
figures. Under this idealization, objects with two equal sides can be
assigned to the category "isoceles triangle". Once the object is assigned to
this category, one can make the inference that it also has two equal angles,
among other things. [...] A smart organism can use formal systems as
idealizations of the world to infer unknown properties from known ones. In
the physiology of categorization, no less than in the history of science,
idealization or selective ignoring of salient correlational structure is
crucial to apprehending causal laws."

"We suggest, then, that wherever classical categories are to be fouind in
human cognition, they will be part of a mentally represented formal system
allowing deductions to be made. Given the function of concepts, why else
would one bother to assign an object to a classical category? What is
unnatural, then, about traditional experiments in concept formation [...] in
which subjects learn categories like "red square with two borders" is not
that the categories have sharp bounderies of necessary and sufficient
conditions, but that the categories are not part of a system allowing
interesting inferences to be drawn -- they are unnatural because they are
literally useless."

"Though one tends to think of formal systems as the province of systematic
education in modern societies, there are a variety of kinds of formal
systems capturing inference-supporting regularities that could be accessible
to people, including preindustrial and preagricultural societies. [...] Here
are some examples:

"Arithmetic, with classical categories like 'a set of three objects'
supporting inferences like 'cannot be divided into two equal parts',
independent of the properties of objects that can be grouped into threes."
[...]
"Folk biology, with classical categories like 'toad of kind x', which
support inferences like 'extract of mouth gland when boiled and dried is
poisonous', regardless of its similarities to nonpoisonous toads or its
dissimilarities to other poisonous toads."

"Folk physiology, with the famous all-or-none category 'pregnant',
supporting the inferences 'female', 'nonvirgin', and 'future mother'
regardless of weight or body shape."

"In addition, the world of humans contains other humans and there is a
reason to expect mentally represented formal systems to arise that govern
the conduct of humans with one another. [...] It is not hard to identify
formal systems involved in social interaction that define classical
categories:"

"Kinship, with classical categories like 'grandmother of X', supporting
inferences like 'may be the mother of X's uncle or aunt' ..."

"Sociopolitical structure, with classical categories like 'president' or
'chief' supporting inferences like 'carries out decisions on entering wars',
regardless of physical strength, height, sex, and so on."
========================================

&gt; &gt; Regarding terminology, the terms "regular" and "irregular" are somewhat
&gt; &gt; neutral and descriptive,
&gt;
&gt; I would say that they are misleading, since all "normal" concepts,
&gt; i.e., the ones that we use 99.9% of the time, would be classified
&gt; as "irregular".

Based on the discussion of Pinker and Prince, I would disagree -- It seems
that many of the normal concepts we use much of the time are "regular".

&gt; &gt; while "natural" and "technical" may be confusing
&gt; &gt; since, as you point out, scientists try to develop technical
&gt; definitions /
&gt; &gt; descriptions for natural concepts like "space", "time", etc. However, I
&gt; &gt; would not object to using the terms "natural" and "technical"
&gt; in this way.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Another terminology that is used in the literature is, of course,
&gt; &gt; "classical" vs. "family resemblance" category.
&gt;
&gt; Again, classical has the connotation of "normal", which is also
&gt; misleading since no natural concepts can be defined classically.
&gt; The basic point that Wittgenstein was making is that all natural
&gt; concepts are learned by "family resemblance", and they only have
&gt; a single, unambiguous meaning within the scope of a single
&gt; language game.

Again based on the discussion of Pinker and Prince, it seems that there are
important natural concepts that represent important properties in the real
world, which are not learned only by example and family resemblance, but
which are formalized within theories.

&gt; In my proposed method of formalizing W's language games, I consider
&gt; the infinite lattice of all possible theories.  Each theory in the
&gt; lattice corresponds to a different language game.  Within any one
&gt; theory, each term (predicate name, concept type, or whatever) has
&gt; a single meaning.  But there are infinitely many possible theories.
&gt; Therefore, each term may have an infinite number of meanings.

&gt; Therefore, I would define a "normal" or "natural" concept as one
&gt; with an open-ended, possibly infinite number of "meanings" (i.e.,
&gt; one meaning for each theory or language game in which it appears).
&gt; A technical concept is one that is restricted to a single theory,
&gt; in which it has a single "meaning".
&gt;
&gt; For example, the word "dog" would correspond to the concept type
&gt; Dog, which would have meanings Dog.1, Dog.2, Dog.3, ...., for every
&gt; theory in the lattice in which the concept tyep Dog or the predicate
&gt; name dog appears.
&gt;
&gt; The same thing would be true of the words "space", "time", "number",
&gt; "operating system", or any other term used in science:  it would have
&gt; a potentially infinite number of meanings that would vary according
&gt; to the theory happens to appear in.

There are infinitely many possible theories, but I think that individual
humans typically only reason with a finite number of theories. Also it seems
that for a "regular concept", an individual human may only have a few
theories that provide formal representations of it, reflecting different
ways it can be formalized. What makes the different theories useful is the
broad applicability that each formalization has in different contexts.

Thus I would suspect that each human typically only has a few different
theories providing different formalizations of "space", "time", "number",
etc., and that these are used and re-used frequently, in different contexts.

Here is what Pinker and Prince say about "family resemblance" categories in
nature:

========================================
"Are there cases where learners of conceptual categories are similarly
forced to cope with a family resemblance structure in nature if they are to
be able to make inferences about it? Many people have noted similarities
between linguistic and biological evolution (see, e.g. Cavalli-Sforza and
Feldman 1981) and there is a particularly compelling analogy in the
formation of family resemblance categories in the evolution of biological
taxa."

"It is generally believed that a novel species evolves from a small
interbreeding population occupying a local, hence relatively homogenous
stable environment. Through natural selection, the organisms become adapted
to the local environment, with the adaptive traits spreading through
population via sexual reproduction. As a result, the population assumes a
morphology that is relatively uniform - since selection acts to reduce
varation (Sober 1984; Ridley 1986) - and predictable in part from
engineering consdierations to the extent that the organism's niche and
selection pressures can be identified (Hutchinson 1959; Williams 1966;
Dawkins 1986)."

"Subsequent geographic dispersal can cause the members of the ancestral
population to form reproductively isolated subgroups. [...] a set of
distinct processes destroy the homogeneity of class: genetic drift, local
geographic and climatic changes imposing new selection pressures, adaptive
radiations following entry into empty environments, and local extinctions.
As a result, the descendants of the ancestral species form a family
resemblance category - the category of 'birds' for example. Robins,
penguins, and ostriches share many features (e.g. feathers) because of their
common ancestry from a single population adapted to flying, while differing
because of independent processes applying to different members of that
population through history."

"[...] the family resemblance structure of many biological taxa comes from
the world, not just the minds of those learning about them. Note that such
family resemblance structures are not always identical with classically
defined categories, and they may be indispensable even in the best
scientific theories."
[...]
"Since objects cannot escape the direct influence of laws while retaining
some of their effects, a smart organism cannot count on always being able to
capture the world's regularities in formal systems. [...] no observer, not
even a scientist equipped with a knowledge of physiology and ecology, would
be able to explain why penguins have feathers, like robins, rather than fur,
like seals. Instead, it will often be best simply to record the
interpredictive contingencies among objects' properties to infer unknown
properties from known ones. Thus a smart observer can record the
contingencies among feathers, wings, egg-laying, beaks, and so on, to note
that the world contains a set of objects in which these properties cluster
and to use the presence of one subset of properties to infer the likely
presence of others."
========================================

Based on this discussion by Pinker and Prince, I do not tend to think of an
"irregular" concept as one that has an open-ended, possibly infinite number
of meanings with one meaning for each theory or language game in which it
appears.

Rather, it seems that an irregular concept may have an open-ended set of
meanings that are learned within a single context. Thus we do not have an
infinite set of theories for "Bird" or "Dog". Rather we have a single
context or theory called "biology" in which there are open-ended, irregular
clusters called "Bird" and "Dog".

(One other point that Pinker and Prince make is that some concepts have both
regular and irregular representations.)
