In a message today, Ian Niles includes many of his documentation strings, such as:
---------------------
&gt; &gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is any entity whose 
&gt; parts are wholly
&gt; &gt;present whenever it is present.")
----------------------

And later in the same message he writes:
---------------------
These docu-strings are supposed to make the meaning
of the concepts clear to people who weren't involved in constructing the
ontology.
----------------------

I agree with the stated goal, but I offer all of our current documentation strings as evidence that we are nowhere near that goal.

To pick on this one example, a "man on the street" (and most of us) would have no idea of what a Continuant is based on this definition.  Let's see, ...an entity whose parts are wholly present whenever it is present.  I first strain to think of anything that doesn't fit this category.  Well, maybe it means something that's not missing any of its parts, so a car that's missing its back seat would not be a Continuant (?).  But what does "wholly present" mean?  Does it mean the parts are correctly assembled and not just lying in a pile?  If my car's back set is sitting on the ground beside it, is it wholly present?  If it's in the same garage, or the same city, or the same state, is it wholly present?   How close does it have to be to be present?

It turns out that the author is apparently not using the word "parts" in any normal sense, but probably means it to refer to temporal parts (a completely foreign usage to anyone but us).  Or does it also refer to physical parts at the same time?  If a set is an entity, do members of a set count as its parts, and how can we tell whether they are "present" or not, or whether the set itself is present?  These are the sorts of questions anyone might have when reading this definition.

My recommendation is that we should focus on getting rich definitions written for these concepts, so that we can all understand them before we go any further.  The definitions should include all the explanatory text we can create, including discussions of where the boundaries of each concept are (i.e., what barely fits this definition, and what just misses?).  There should be plenty of examples of the full range of entities that fit the category, and of some that don't, and why not.  Perhaps we want a second relation like "discussion" where all the issues and subtle problems with each concept are stored.  

Take a look at some of the longer definitions in the Cyc upper ontology for examples of the minimal amount of documentation we should strive for.  Also, it would be good for our documentation to point to the equivalent (or closest) concept in Cyc (and anyone else's public ontology), so that we might have a better chance to understand what the author is trying to say.

By the way, I'm becoming slightly more optimistic that this effort might someday produce something, now that Pat Hayes and others are tackling the errors and confusions in the "merged ontology" file.  Thanks to Ian Niles for getting this ball rolling.
