&gt; I have the title of this essay to reflect what I see

It would be better to stick with the title I proposed, in terms of giving
people a transparent idea what the thread is about...

&gt; &gt; To summarize your message, there seem to be
&gt; &gt; at least the following alternative perspectives:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) semiotic concepts have no place in SUO,
&gt; &gt;    since ontologies are supposed to be about
&gt; &gt;    things that exist,
&gt;
&gt; Notice what you just said, by way of stating this POV:
&gt;
&gt; "ontologies are supposed to be about things that exist"
&gt;
&gt; You have just told me what (you believe)
&gt; an ontology is "supposed" to be "about" --
&gt; you have not told me what an ontology is --
&gt; unless what it is reduces to the question
&gt; of what it is "supposed" to be "about".
&gt; Is that not an interesting observation?

It is a mistaken observation. I merely tried to summarize three points of
view. I did not say that I personally suppose an ontology can only be about
things that exist.

&gt;
&gt; Two questions almost immediately come to mind:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  "Supposed" by whom?  Unlike some folks,
&gt;     I do not have faith in disembodied POV's,
&gt;     so this is a question as to the implicit
&gt;     interpreters, the agents or the community,
&gt;     that are the bearers of this "supposition".

Well, if anyone subscribes to this first point of view, they can speak for
themselves.

&gt;
&gt; 2.  What other sorts of things are defined by
&gt;     "what" they are "about", plus, perhaps,
&gt;     "how" they go "about" being "about" it?
&gt;     To spare you the suspense, those of us who
&gt;     did not discover the importance of signs
&gt;     suddenly last summer have been used to
&gt;     calling such things "sign relations".
&gt;
&gt;     In this case, an "ontology", which,
&gt;     like its name SCREAMS out that it IS,
&gt;     to use that extra "UMPH" that appears
&gt;     hereabouts to be sufficient to deliver
&gt;     an embryonic sign into that status of
&gt;     being an honest-to-God -- and HE always
&gt;     knows who HE IS -- indicator of BEING,
&gt;     well, this onto+logy is neither being
&gt;     by itself nor signs by themselves, but,
&gt;     like its just keeps on hinting, a thing
&gt;     about relationships among sign-things
&gt;     and their object-things.  In short,
&gt;     an ontology is a sign relation, and
&gt;     so now I, at least, have just told
&gt;     you, perhaps for the first time in
&gt;     your hearing, what an ontology IS.

Gee, thanks very much for your powerful, religious insight. It does not seem
all that new, however.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Someone has to listen when I talk --
&gt; Why does it have to be only me!?
&gt;
&gt; It would be interesting if you 'could' hear ...
&gt; The specific thoughts that I already stated ...

It would be interesting if you could write in words that clearly conveyed
specific thoughts.

&gt; Then, we could begin to have a conversation ...

Before you take the mote out of my eye, pull the log out of yours.
