Dear Philip,
 
Below you suggest that EXPRESS has been proposed as an alternative to KIF.
This can only be supposed to come from me, so in case others think this too,
let me say plainly that I do not propose EXPRESS as an alternative to KIF
for the purpose of developing an SUO. It happens I have some useful content
that is defined in EXPRESS, and I think it is useful to expose people to
content in a "foreign" language so they can understand how difficult it is
for those of us who are not native KIF speakers to read and write KIF, but
that is all.
 

Regards 
      Matthew

Subject: SUO: Some Procedural Suggestions


Jim, and all,
 
Once again I will jump into the fray with a few comments and suggestions for
how to proceed.
 
It seems to me that SUO has been making progress, yet three central issues
are unresolved:
 
1) What are the objectives for use of the SUO?
 
2) What are the requirements for the SUO?
 
3) What are the requirements for the language(s) in which the SUO will be
represented?
 
Before we can decide what language to use we need to agree on the
requirements for the language. The requirements for the language depend on
the requirements for the SUO, which depend on the objectives for the SUO.
 
Much of the discussion in SUO seems to involve these issues while trying to
make progress on theoretical questions related to the SUO itself. There
needs to be a consensus on these issues before people can agree about the
value of any proposed candidate for the SUO, or any proposed elements of an
SUO, though efforts such as Ian Niles' "merged ontology" are valuable at
least as strawmen to help identify issues.
 
The objectives of the SUO are addressed briefly at the SUO website, in
sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, though questions still arise
about the objectives.
 
Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in the sections
on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there are questions that are
unresolved about the requirements. E.g. the Scope discussion says "an upper
ontology is limited to concepts that are meta, generic, abstract and
philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether the ontology should
include "semiotic concepts" or should only include things that "really
exist" in the world.
 
The SUO website lists KIF or the simplified version as the proposed language
for the standard, without giving a discussion of the requirements for the
language. We have proposals for alternative languages (e.g. EXPRESS), and
ongoing discussions about some of the requirements for the language. E.g.
does the language need to include reflection, does it need to represent
semiotic concepts, does it need to be a programming language? Which elements
of an SUO should be built into the language, and which should be expressed
using the language? Does it need to be a higher-order language or should SUO
be expressed at the level of first order predicate calculus, etc.?
 
Many such questions have already been addressed at one time or another in
email threads among the participants. Yet it appears that there is no way to
determine what has been resolved or agreed about these questions (and what
is still unresolved) without reviewing all the email correspondence, which
is not practical.
 
To address these issues, I recommend that the SUO participants take a
standard software engineering approach, and collaborate on development of
concise yet complete requirements specifications for the SUO and for its
language.
 
These requirements specifications should be located on the SUO web site and
should be working documents that are iteratively developed, starting with
the current statements of scope and purpose. I'd recommend that these
specifications be presented in a "requirements outline" format, where each
requirement or issue is very concisely stated in a single sentence, and
sub-requirements and issues are added as the group develops them.
Hyperlinks could be used to give more complete discussions of the
requirements, issues and resolutions, with pointers to the email
correspondence about them. We may need to have votes about specific
requirements, to resolve their status.
 
The precise format of the requirements outline is not important, but it
should be something that is very concise yet complete. E.g., something like
the indented table of contents outline for a standard FAQ would be useful.
 
Also, email correspondence could try to follow a standard of having the
specific requirement or issue identified in the email subject line, in a
standard way, so that people can easily see which requirements and issues
are being discussed, find other relevant email, etc.
 
Finally, it is clear that there are distinct differences of opinion among
the participants about the answers to questions related to requirements for
the SUO and its language. Indeed, questions about requirements are
"inevitably intertwined"* with theoretical questions about the design and
implementation of the ontology, and with theoretical questions about
ontology and knowledge representation in general. On some of these questions
we may not reach consensus, and the SUO effort may need to "fork" and
explore alternative answers. This would allow progress to be made on
multiple paths when it is not clear to everyone which is the best path to
pursue.
 

Sincerely,
 
Phil Jackson
