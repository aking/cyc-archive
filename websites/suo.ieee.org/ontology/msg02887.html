Jean-Marc,

In my anticipation of a future development whose time is not yet prepared,
I created a potential for a certain confusion in the picture that I drew
last time, attempting to show the connections among abstract hypostases,
reasoning by analogy, the invocation of formal models, and the combined
intensions, or "comprehension", that is common to an object and its icon,
that is, its formal likeness.  So let me try to make amends this time around,
and maybe even foreshadow where I believe this discussion is eventually going.

JM:  Jon, I understand your position but I don't see how you can
     particularize your model to individual and collective semiosis
     and enquiry if all references to a mind, perception, feeling,
     experience etc. are considered accidental, unessential, ...
     Maybe I am looking at the issue from much too near a distance
     but from where you stand, even with binoculars, it could be
     that you are missing the details?

JA:  You and I have scattered the words like stars across the stygian void:
     accident, collection, detail, distance, essence, incident, individual,
     inquiry, particular, position, semiosis, substance, an even dozen lot
     of categories to rival the starry-eyed if not the gods.  Do we really
     grasp their meaning, or does their reach exceed our charts and graphs?
     And what of their bearing on the earth below, and how are they kin to
     the pluralities of affects, experiences, feelings, hearts, minds, and
     senses that we bear?  Do you actually imagine that I would cleave the
     wonder of this beautiful child, that I'll once and forever be, in two?
     Guess again, and again, and still again, for your birth gives you the
     right to cast the guesses like stars into the skies of one brief life.

JA:  I still see our lack of congruence in this area
     as going back to a misunderstanding about the
     nature and the use of explicit formal models.

JA:  A person can "do phenomenology" for a very long time before they
     have to make a deliberate effort to dredge up some formal model
     to organize the complexity of their accumulating observations.
     We are always swimming in the ocean of experience, and there
     is nothing that we have to do to "particularize" anything,
     or to anchor what we do to the surrounding whatevers.
     Indeed, my experience has taught me, to the contrary,
     just when I think that the problem is how to connect,
     to integrate, or to synthesize diverse elements of
     experience, that the real problem is only why did
     I even think that I knew how to distinguish them
     in the first place.  Many times, the best way
     to achieve the true integration between two
     bits of experience is just to quit drawing
     the imaginary line of a false distinction.

JA:  But when we do get to the point of needing to formulate,
     more reflectively than reflexively, an explicit model,
     then we are crossing the threshold of abstraction,
     of one kind or the other.  As a matter of fact,
     I think that the names that Peirce uses for
     the two kinds of abstraction, "prescissive"
     and "hypostatic", do not really draw out
     the way in which they are actually kin,
     and I have been tempted to coin the
     name "hyperstatic" for the former.

JA:  In a sense, both types of abstraction start out the same way, merely
     emboldening particular patterns kenned in the steam of consciousness
     until they condense or desublimate into fixtures of suspended doubts.
     Thus is precipitated a superficial but practically essential tension
     between the casual circus and the formal arena, and the show is just
     not the same after that.  The best picture of the evolving situation
     that I have found so far, at least, under the rose of simplicity, is
     the one that Aristotle gives in his paradigm of reasoning by analogy:

     <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01350.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01350.html</A>
     <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01772.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01772.html</A>
     <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg04768.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg04768.html</A>

Here, for the sake of comparison,
is the picture as I drew it and
the story as I told it last time:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~ARCHIVE~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Aristotle's A-Frame structure of analogy equips us with an archetype
for understanding the relation between abstraction and analogy, plus
the relationship of models and morphisms.  Let us trace it like this:

|                               Comprehension
|                                     C

|                          /          |          \

|                        /       Abstraction       \
|                       /        Hypostasis?        \
|                      /        *           *        \
|                     /       *               *       \

|                 /   *                               *   \
|                /  *                                   *  \
|               / *                 Arrow                 * \

I have labeled the top node "Comprehension" because I believe that this
is the classical word for the conjunction of all of the intensions that
a collection of subjects have in common, but my impression is hazy here,
and so I will just have to use it this way provisionally for the moment.
The middle term A is an explanatory, pertinent, or relevant Abstraction,
the property that accounts for all of the rest of the properties in the
Comprehension.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~EVIHCRA~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

If you take what I say here quite literally -- and I gave you no
reason to do otherwise -- then this just fails to make good sense.
For if the comprehension C is the conjunction of "all" intensions,
then whatever intension evolves as the accountable abstraction A
is already among them, and so we have C =&gt; A.  But the picture
appears to suggest that A =&gt; C.  Of course, this could happen,
but it does not represent the most generic state of affairs.

By way of excusing myself, let me explain what caused me to say this.
First, I am jumping ahead in my thoughts to a text of Peirce's where
he overlays a type of abductive reasoning on this picture of analogy.
Second, the order of development that I am trying to diagram here is
not a static hierarchy of implications but a dynamic evolution, thus
involving at least two distinct moments in time.

I think that I can fix up the rest of this discussion by redrawing and
relabeling slightly the adaptation that I made of Aristotle's A-Frame.

Let us now consider the two chief moments in the development of the argument
as they work out in Aristotle's paradigmatic example of analogical reasoning.

The apical node is labeled "Initial Comprehension" (IC) to indicate
the conjunction of the intensions that are implicit in an agent's
initial understanding of what the analogue subjects have in common.

The middle node is labeled "Evolute Comprehension (EC) to indicate
the conjunction of the intensions that are evolved in an agents's
reflective understanding of the situation or the state of affairs.

In Aristotle's original example the argument began with the conjunction
of many qualities that were called to mind in regard to several well-known
battles, whose effects could be summed up by saying that that their results
turned out to be "Adverse" (A) for all sides.  After a moment of reflection,
the reasoning agent becomes aware of a new intension, whose significance has
gone previously unnoticed, to wit, the common case that all of these debacles
were instances of "Battles Between Bordermates" (B), and this serves as the
pivot point for an extension of the argument by analogy to an anticipated
application, one that is actively being contemplated but still avoidable,
amounting to a prediction of adversity arising from a future contingent
war against neighbors, anticipated but not yet engaged.

I hope this still makes sense tomorrow morning.
