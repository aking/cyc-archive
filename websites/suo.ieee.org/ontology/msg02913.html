&gt; 
&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; That is indeed a laudable purpose:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My purpose here is develop the application of some formal techniques
&gt; &gt; that arise out of the pragmatic theory of sign relations and to use
&gt; &gt; them toward one specific end, that of constructing a web framework
&gt; &gt; in which intercommunicability and interoperability might actually
&gt; &gt; be feasible and not just something that people prattle on about,
&gt; 
&gt; Good!  But formal techniques are incredibly boring, even to formalists,
&gt; when the purpose and applications are shrouded in the mists.  In order
&gt; to communicate effectively with people who have problems, you must show
&gt; how your formalism can help solve their problems.

What can I say?  Rapping about AI is periodically hip, with a time domain
frequency that approximates the fashion cycle of bell-bottom jeans, while
genuine programming is boring at any age, or season, or speed.  Right now,
the language of meta*sem[-antic|-iotic] is all the rave, with a parliament
of Sem-Onto-Web birds busily re-inventing genre X non-definitions for each
newfangered word they heard drifting through the air last week, exercising
their birthright to ignore every "unbearable lightness of content" (ULOC)
that was decanted into print before they were born, and some of them were
born yesterday.  I know where this leads.  I have seen way too many honest
endeavors bite the dust because of it.

&gt; &gt; the way that they have always done about AI, until one of four
&gt; &gt; things up &amp; happen:  (1) they realize that "gee, this is hard",
&gt; &gt; and drop it, (2) they get tired of their own repetitiveness,
&gt; &gt; (3) they discredit themselves with the utter futility of
&gt; &gt; their attempts, (4) the mainstream does what it usually
&gt; &gt; does, and drowns them all in their sleep, with the able
&gt; &gt; assistance of not few off-mainstream contributaries.
&gt; 
&gt; People working in AI are very well aware of the difficulties.
&gt; Graeme Hirst expressed the general frustration in a pithy slogan:
&gt; 
&gt;    A year working on AI is enough to make you believe in God.

I am not talking about what the people doing the work are aware of.

&gt; AI researchers would applaud any advance you make toward a solution.
&gt; But before they are willing to study your formalism, you must show
&gt; how it relates to their problems, as they state them.  If they
&gt; have not formulated their problem statements in a manner that
&gt; you consider appropriate, then you should start with their
&gt; statement exactly as they have stated it, and transform
&gt; it systematically into a form that is amenable to your
&gt; approach.  And then show how your formalism solves it.

There is a time for negative critique -- it almost never does much good --
there is a time for positive construction -- that usually works better over
the long haul, even if it does force you to work like Frogger on the Freeway --
but there are some long-term factors of cultural lag and even a bit of retrograde
motion involved here.  When I started reading AI, folks like McCulloch and Arbib
explicitly referred to Peirce's work as having posed some of the key problems;
when I first worked on databases, your average Dick or Jane DBA was aware that
that their livelihood derived from Peirces' Logic of Relations;  when I first
took up with cognitive scientists, many of them could recite Shannon's formula
for information capacity by heart.  These days, you see people tossing these
ideas about the web, shorn of their effective definitions, totally oblivious
of what drives the bus these bosons are riding on.  Only futility will ensue.
It is not a light matter.

&gt; My earlier recommendation still stands.  That is exactly what
&gt; I have been doing with all of my writings.  I don't serialize
&gt; my papers or books as email installments.  I put them on the
&gt; web, send a short note to announce them, and let people read
&gt; them or ignore them at their pleasure:
&gt; 
&gt; JS&gt; &gt;  1. Organize your notes on this topic into an article
&gt;   &gt; &gt;     and contribute it as a paper on the SUO web server.
&gt;   &gt; &gt;     Then send one note to all and sundry about that paper.
&gt; 
&gt; JA&gt; Look, I am working the applications of these ideas in dialogue fashion.
&gt;   &gt; It may be in dialogue with somebody I was talking to last week, last year,
&gt;   &gt; or 30 years ago, that I am just now working out an answer to, or somebody
&gt;   &gt; in the future, but dialogue it is.
&gt; 
&gt; That is good.  But you can't have a dialog with people who are
&gt; so disgusted with your incessant emails that they automatically
&gt; push the delete or program their computer to do it for them.
&gt; 
&gt; JA&gt; I have already spent those 30 years
&gt; &gt;   writing papers and reports that nobody will ever read.
&gt; 
&gt; Then perhaps you should take Mrs. Joyce's advice:  "James,
&gt; why don't you write books that people can understand?"
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any day now
&gt; &gt; I will chuck this whole hassle, go back and finish my dissertation,
&gt; &gt; wrap it up in black leather on some library shelf, and you can all
&gt; &gt; read about it in 120 years or so, if ever, the way that it's always
&gt; &gt; been done before.  And I will have learned what I am already beginning
&gt; &gt; to suspect, that all of thes folks running around telling us how this
&gt; &gt; brave new web is going to catalyze that process and give us new ways
&gt; &gt; of speaking and working togteher, presnet company not excluded --
&gt; &gt; well, I've heard that one before, too.
&gt; 
&gt; There is certainly a great deal that you have learned through your
&gt; years of inquiry.  And there is a great deal that many people who
&gt; subscribe to these mailing lists could learn from you.  But you
&gt; have to meet your audience at least part of the way.  You must
&gt; show how your work can help solve their problems.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is new stuff, John.  The computational and extensional work-ups
&gt; &gt; of the sign-relational basis have been ignored by the philosophical
&gt; &gt; side of the Peirce community, and this whole field has lain fallow
&gt; &gt; since Peirce left it.
&gt; 
&gt; That is certainly true.  I believe that there is an enormous amount
&gt; of work to be done in building on Peirce's foundations.  But to show
&gt; how it is relevant to anybody's interests, you must show how it can
&gt; solve their problems.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have this book.  It is a very nice, very gentle, very non-technical
&gt; &gt; popularization of a well-chosen sample of Peirce ideas.  Fine &amp; dandy.
&gt; 
&gt; I was not mentioning it for your enlightenment, but for the people
&gt; who might want to read a gentle, non-technical popularization.
&gt; Perhaps if they had such an intro, they might be more inclined
&gt; to read the sequel.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That has very little to do with what I am trying to do here on behalf
&gt; &gt; of the SUO effort, for the sake of developing the theory of signs, or
&gt; &gt; in pursuit of its yet untapped applications to problems of computation,
&gt; &gt; communications, and intelligent systems engineering.
&gt; 
&gt; That is why I have been saying that you need to show the SUO gang,
&gt; in terms that they can appreciate, how your work on their behelf
&gt; is going to help them.  And that means that you have to address
&gt; their problems directly, if you want them to pay attention.

Here's the deal.  I view the theory of signs as very analogous
to the theory of groups.  People have been using sign relations
and working in groups for millennia, but the group concept did
not crystallize until it was catalyzed by Galois' blood in 1832,
figuratively speaking, and the sign concept needed the sweat of
Peirce's brow over many years even to begin to germinate.  But
group theory was not commonly taught in high schools in my time,
and I cannot imagine that we will live to see sign theory become
a "standard undergraduate onus".  Aside from this, a large part
of what fills the notorious "volume" of the SUO list has been
the necessary transfer that those who have had one course
in set theory display to impress those who have had none,
when I know and you know that all that anybody needs to
know for the kinds of work that we will, at best, ever
do here is all contained in Halmos' Naive Set Theory,
if even all of that.  So none of us have any native
background in the subject of sign theory, and even
the little bit of crude ore that I can dig out of
Peirce's mind requires me to make up a lot of the
filler as I go along.  I do not see how any sort
of detailed and effective work can escape this.
If the assembled company lacks the grit or the
patience to learn new tools then I really do
not see how they can expect to accomplish
the sorts of work they are talking about.

&gt; &gt; Aside from that,
&gt; &gt; you and I both know the history of pragmatic thinking:  the likes of
&gt; &gt; James, Dewey, Morris, and others, to various degrees and all with the
&gt; &gt; very best of intentions, afforded extremely convenient straw-targets
&gt; &gt; for the likes of Russell, Carnap, Quine, and others to set afire or
&gt; &gt; just plain ignore.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I keep telling people that they should read the master instead
&gt; of spending too much time on his disciples.  But most people don't
&gt; bother to read any of them.  And unless you can show how Peirce's
&gt; work and your extensions are relevant to them, they won't pay any
&gt; attention to your work either.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line:  Practice Part III, Rhetoric -- not in a way that
&gt; pleases yourself, but in a way that pleases your audience.

From what I have seen over the past couple of years,
these web pages might as well be bound in leather.
I know for my own part that I have put a lot of
work into trying to adapt my message to the
person that I was talking to at the time.
I have been trying to save people time
in the long run.  If they do not want
the help, that's fine, I have done
my duty.  I rest in knowing that.
