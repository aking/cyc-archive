&gt; Subject: Re: SUO: Vote on Merged Ontology as a 'Base Document' for SUO
&gt; WG
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;SUO Participants,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. Attached is the latest version of Ian Niles'  Merged Ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2. This message is a call for a vote as to whether this 
&gt; document should be
&gt; &gt;approved as a 'Base Document' for IEEE P1600.1 Standard 
&gt; Upper Ontology
&gt; &gt;Working Group.  Within IEEE, there is no official definition 
&gt; of a Base
&gt; &gt;Document; however, the definitions below from the IEEE 
&gt; Learning Technology
&gt; &gt;Standards Committee (our original sponsor) are as good as any.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;3. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of 
&gt; consensus we have
&gt; &gt;for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need 
&gt; to decide if we
&gt; &gt;are going to go down this path or not.  Multiple base documents are
&gt; &gt;possible, so anyone else is free to submit one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;4. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose 
&gt; improvements to the
&gt; &gt;document, unless they are major enough for you to vote 
&gt; against focusing work
&gt; &gt;on this document.  However, such general improvement 
&gt; comments are welcome
&gt; &gt;and will be resolved (but not until after completion of this 
&gt; Base Document
&gt; &gt;vote).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;5. Since we are still in the process of establishing 
&gt; official voting rights,
&gt; &gt;I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw poll, 
&gt; such that
&gt; &gt;anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if 
&gt; consensus is not
&gt; &gt;clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote 
&gt; (once voting
&gt; &gt;rights are established).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;6. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), NO (comments
&gt; &gt;required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I vote NO.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments: I don't mean to denigrate Niles' hard work, but it is 
&gt; ridiculously premature to adopt this (or anything else like this) as 
&gt; a base document. This document doesnt even come close to the 
&gt; requirement for a base document given in the accompanying text:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;base document: Starting point for standards words (it's 
&gt; clear the document
&gt; &gt;*can* be transformed into standards words).
&gt; 
&gt; It has no overall coherent ontological model; it represents a melange 
&gt; of conflicting and incommensurate views on many basic ontological 
&gt; issues. Its axioms have no global coherence (for example: the 
&gt; intended meaning of the quantifiers varies from one place to another 
&gt; in the document; later axioms do not conform to the categories 
&gt; introduced in the earlier axioms; many, if not most, of the major 
&gt; classifications depend on questionable and controversial philosphical 
&gt; presuppositions.) It fails to address many of the basic ontological 
&gt; issues that ned to be got clear before we can put any ontology to 
&gt; practical use (how to represent time and change, how to deal with 
&gt; alternative courses of reality, for example. ) 

OK, I'll respond to your three broad criticisms in turn.  First, in the
initial version of the merged ontology there definitely were cases where one
axiom contradicted another axiom or contradicted a subsumption relation
between two concepts.  Furthermore, you kindly took the time to point out
many of these cases, and they were resolved, to some degree at least, in the
revised version of the merged ontology.  I'm sure that this version contains
many other inconsistencies, but it seems to me that the way to handle these
remaining cases is to resolve them point-by-point rather than tossing out
everything that has been done thus far.  As for your criticism that the
axioms have no global coherence, I don't see that this is true.  If the
quantifiers indeed vary in scope across different blocks of axioms, this
problem can be resolved by introducing typed quantifiers or a similar
apparatus.  As for a lack of conformity to the same set of categories and
the overabundance of controversial philosophical distinctions, I know you
indicated in your earlier comments many specific points where this occurred,
but I did try to accomodate these criticisms in the latest version of the
ontology.  If there are points where additional revision is needed, please
let me know.  Finally, as regards your claim that we should get clear about
basic ontological issues before proceeding to the development of an actual
ontology, it seems to me that the 2,500 year history of philosophy is a
fairly powerful argument against this approach.  I think that speculation
about isolated points independent of a concrete fabric within which these
points have a context and an application has resulted in many centuries of
wasted effort.  I would argue that the best way of obtaining consensus is to
produce an initial document (no matter how flawed) and then to revise it
over many, many iterations of criticism and comment. 

&gt;Moreover, it is clear 
&gt; that the more 'pieces' are added to it, the more these problems are 
&gt; going to get worse rather than better.
&gt; 
&gt; This methodology is fundamentally flawed. There is no way to achieve 
&gt; a coherent ontology by 'merging' axioms from incommensurate 
&gt; ontological perspectives in this simplistic way. It is rather like 
&gt; trying to create  a large piece of software by just adjoining pieces 
&gt; of code written by different authors in different computer languages, 
&gt; and expecting it to magically work.

I agree that this sort of methodology would be fundamentally flawed.
However, this is not what I have tried to do.  I have tried to integrate the
axioms/subsumption relationships of various different ontologies into the
same stock of concepts (taken from a simplified version of John Sowa's
upper-level ontology).  If there are still cases of incommensurate
concepts/axioms in the latest version of the ontology, please let me know
what they are.

&gt; 
&gt; Apart from the general issues of a lack of a coherent methodology, I 
&gt; have many particular problems with much of the actual content of the 
&gt; document. As it stands, the ontology it outlines would be unworkable 
&gt; for me for almost any practical purpose, even if it were globally 
&gt; coherent. But this is not the right place to go into details.

I agree.  One can interpret the call for the vote as the question:  Is it
worth going into the details?
