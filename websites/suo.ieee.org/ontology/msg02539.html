&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Right.  My initial position would be that the ontology should take
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;an intentional view of terms, that disjointness should have a model
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;force of "necessary" (Bill Andersen pointed this out to me in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;private email) and therefore the axiom should be simple implication.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That decision would be a complete and total disaster. It would
&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately make the structural ontology unusable, if taken seriously.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It would be require that KIF be replaced by a modal language and
&gt; &gt; &gt; render all the axioms first-order invalid.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Not that I think a lot hangs on this, but I don't get it.  To change the
&gt; &gt;disjointness axiom so it uses only a conditional would simply allow
&gt; &gt;models where classes could have no instances in common but still not be
&gt; &gt;disjoint.  At which point, exactly, does it start raining fire and
&gt; &gt;brimstone?
&gt; 
&gt; I ought to get more sleep before answering emails. The disaster (IMHO)
&gt; would not be to weaken the axiom, obviously, but to use anything that
&gt; is declared to have a modal meaning. If we start saying that axioms
&gt; mean what they do (eg that A=&gt;.B but not B=&gt;A) because the apparently
&gt; first-order assertions are really modal assertions in disguise, then
&gt; we are wandering into semantic fairyland, and the actual formal
&gt; language isnt in fact what we really mean when we write axioms in it.
&gt; No axiom anywhere is now safe, or sure to mean what it seems to mean:
&gt; there are modalities everywhere (or at least there might be: how the
&gt; hell could we tell, since they arent in the syntax?) Not fire and
&gt; brimstone, just fog.

Well, I'm not sure this response helps to clear the air, Pat.  The fact
is that the modal character of a concept might be reflected in its
nonmodal axiomatization.  It doesn't follow from that that the
axiomatization is therefore "really a modal assertion in disguise", or
that it doesn't mean what it seems to mean; to the contrary, it means
exactly what it seems to mean.  There are no hidden modalities lurking
in the nearby bushes.

Here's the kind of situation that it seems to me important to avoid.
Maybe it will illustrate some confusion on my part that needs clearing
up.  Suppose, in the usual extensional fashion, we define a relation R
to be symmetric if and only if, for all x and y, if Rxy then Ryx.
Suppose now we have an ontology of human relationships that includes the
loving relation, and that we are applying that ontology with respect to
a given domain of persons in which, as fortune would have it, all love
is requited.  By our axiom, we infer that loving is symmetric.  Now
suppose our domain broadens to include Johann and Martha, and that
Johann loves Martha, but that his ardor is not reciprocated.  Is not our
ontology now inconsistent with this fact?  How do you propose to avoid
situations like this?  Seems to me (though I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise) the thing to do is to recognize that there's more to symmetry
(call it a modal element, or don't) than just satisfying -- as a matter
of current contingent fact -- that Rxy materially implies Ryx, and that
this is most naturally expressed, in a nonmodal language, by using a
conditional rather than a biconditional in the symmetry axiom.  Symmetry
thus becomes a property that has to be *declared* true of a relation
rather than *inferred* from its instances.

&gt; ...But honestly, I do get fed up having to repeat these tired old
&gt; arguments again and again. This all seems so absolutely obvious.

Funny, I feel the same way!  ;-)
