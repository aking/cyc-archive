&gt; &gt;Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am returning to your last reply again,
&gt; &gt; to see if I can get any further with it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You say you are interested in integrating
&gt; &gt; &gt; functional and declarative aspects of languages,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which is also a central interest of mine.  Even here,
&gt; &gt; &gt; KIF is worthy of a little careful study (although this goes
&gt; &gt; &gt; way beyond what is needed for the SUO enterprise, I believe).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am planning to discuss this in more detail on the history channel,
&gt; &gt; but I have yet to see what I am looking for in this regard with any
&gt; &gt; of the more standard ways of laying out FOL, or any offspring of it --
&gt; &gt; though I do have this dim memory that I once thought ML and Miranda
&gt; &gt; might provide a promising base of operations on which to build what
&gt; &gt; I want here, I never got down to looking any further into it -- but
&gt; &gt; what 'this' is is the agility and the flexibility of interpretation
&gt; &gt; that permits one to maintain a "functional interpretation" (FI) for
&gt; &gt; all logical expressions.  In short, any logical expression e has an
&gt; &gt; interpretation as a name of a function, almost as if e = "f", where
&gt; &gt; f : X -&gt; B, for a suitable domain X and for B = {0, 1}, as is usual.
&gt; &gt; Here, I say "almost as if" because the range of interpretations for
&gt; &gt; an expression e is actually somewhat broader than a relation to any
&gt; &gt; proper name like "f" would be able to encompass.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, that sounds interesting.  Can you elucidate in what sense it has
&gt; to be 'broader'?  I can see it would be if the expression contained
&gt; quantifiers or bound variables, but in the propositional calculus
&gt; what more does any expression do than define a truthfunction on
&gt; its atoms, ie your 'f' where X is the a finite subset of the
&gt; propositional variables?
&gt; 
&gt; If you have some intensional notion in mind,
&gt; can it be expressed, however indequately,
&gt; as a modality?

Pat,

I was trying to focus on another aspect of the propositional level right now,
like all of the nice things that one could begin to think about if the syntax
and the its processor really supported the "functional interpretation" (FI)
in a uniform way, like being able to define derivatives and differentials
and so on.

That other little side issue takes about 20 pages in my Diss to set-up
carefully, with more fonts than I feel comfortable dragging out of the
galley right now, as I have known some people here complain about that.

The reason for doing all of this is vaguely intensional, in the sense
that you want to treat the propositions as abstract objects that just
happen to have a "functional" and a "geometric" interpretation in the
appropriate sort of coordination with each other, but you do not want
to have them tied down to a particular "universe of discourse" X, and
you would also like to say that a sentence is a syntactic sign-entity
that denotes the abstract proposition as its object, given all of the
necessary information about the context of interpretation, and on top
of all that, you would like to be able to make sense of the idea that
the proposition f "indicates" its fibers (f^(-1))(v) for v in B={0,1},
in negative and positive ways, respectively.  So there are two levels
of denotation, indication, reference, signification, or whatever here,
and that will require a "higher order" (HO) sign relation to properly
formalize.

To keep these abstract propositions "floating on air",
as it were, calls for a categorical construction that
I call a "stretch", which is like a cartesian product
and a pullback rolled into one, except that the fixed
and variable parameters are switched.  The basic idea,
so far as the tale can be told in English, is like so:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~DISSERTATION~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

1.3.10.6  Stretching Principles

There is a principle, of constant use in this work, that
needs to be made explicit.  In order to give it a name,
I refer to this idea as the "stretching principle".
Expressed in different ways, it says that:

1.  Any relation of values extends to a relation of what is valued.

2.  Any statement about values says something about the things that
    are given these values.

3.  Any association among a range of values establishes an association
    among the domains of things that these values are the values of.

4.  Any connection between two values can be stretched to create a connection,
    of analogous form, between the objects, persons, qualities, or relationships
    that are valued in these connections.

5.  For every operation on values, there is a corresponding operation on the
    actions, conducts, functions, procedures, or processes that lead to these
    values, as well as there being analogous operations on the objects that
    instigate all of these various proceedings.

Nothing about the application of the stretching principle guarantees that
the analogues it generates will be as useful as the material it works on.
It is another question entirely whether the links that are forged in this
fashion are equal in their strength and apposite in their bearing to the
tried and true utilities of the original ties, but in principle they are
always there.
