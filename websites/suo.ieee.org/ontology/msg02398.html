&gt; 
&gt; Hi Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; I am developing a representation called the
&gt; Information Flow Framework (IFF) for ontologies
&gt; and their models using the new-KIF.  More specifically,
&gt; my chief goal is to formalize the *truth classification*
&gt; and the *truth concept lattice*.

Robert,

I am torn.  Some of what you appear to be talking about
tugs at the edges of my attention, sounds a bit familiar
in an interseting way, and reminds me of some things that
I was into before I had to get serious about what I could
make work, which required me to pursue the goal-reductive
descent down to my current workshop floor, but the ways
that you are using certain words, like "concept", are
ways that I just cannot do anymore, and as for KIF --
well, up to about a month ago I would have considered
it merely an inconvenient language, one that failed to
provide many of the conveniences that one would like to
have in any reasonable calculus, but my experiences with
the triadicity business have led me toward the conclusion
that KIF, in its present modes of application, at any rate,
constitutes a style of pidgin that is positively debilitating
to good logical health.  Still, all in all, these may turn out
to be remediable issues.

&gt; The truth concept lattice is generated from the truth classification
&gt; of a first-order language L -- whose instances are L-structures, whose
&gt; types are L-sentences, and whose classification relation is satisfaction.
&gt; I would guess that the truth concept lattice is a precise mathematical
&gt; version of John Sowa's lattice of theories:
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03804.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03804.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; In place of John's theories are the formal concepts of this lattice.
&gt; A formal concept in this lattice has an intent which is a closed theory
&gt; (set of sentences) and an extent which is the collection of all models
&gt; for that theory.  The theory (intent) of the join (sup) of two concepts
&gt; is the closure of the intersection of the theories (conceptual intents),
&gt; and the theory (intent) of the meet (inf) of two concepts is the theory
&gt; of the common models.  See the following links:
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01758.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01758.html</A>
&gt; <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg02950.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg02950.html</A>
&gt; <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03839.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03839.html</A>

Just free associating maybe, but this brings to mind
the topics of "Galois Correspondences in Model Theory",
or the "Galois Theory of Models", which I once explored,
but I do not know if I can still find my old bibliography --
I will go look.

Personally, I probably cannot use the words "concept" or "intent" in this way.
The recognition of concepts as symbols, accounting them thus on the syntactic
side of our sign-theoretic ledger domains from the very outset, if not ever
afterwords, is a very important insight to me, and trying to fudge it with
the adjective "formal" is a tactic that I already tried and found tacky.
Your use of "intent" in this way I am just not sure about yet -- I love
a good pun as much as the next person, if there is some point to it,
but perhaps I just do not get it yet.

&gt; To represent this truth classification I must represent the truth formal objects
&gt; (L-structures or models), the truth formal attributes (L-sentences or expressions)
&gt; and the truth incidence relation (satisfaction).  I have done this theoretically,
&gt; but have only partially completed the encoding into the new KIF.  Take for example,
&gt; the representation of a first order structure or model.  Conceptually, this is
&gt; a 2-dimensional mathematical structure that uses the hypergraph notion along
&gt; one dimension and the classification notion along the other dimension.
&gt; I have written new-KIF ontologies for hypergraphs and classifications,
&gt; and it should be easy to put these together for the new-KIF ontology
&gt; for models.
&gt; 
&gt; Now all of this representation is at the metalevel (or structural level)
&gt; of the SUO.  And in particular, this metalevel factors very nicely into
&gt; two levels with distinct objectives, which correspond to the set-theoretic
&gt; notions of sets and classes, respectively.  The object level ontologies
&gt; would not be directly coded in the new KIF, but would use the language
&gt; specified in the lower metalevel consisting of the notions and terminology
&gt; of models, typed expressions, classifications, hypergraphs, etc.  However,
&gt; in my metalevel encoding efforts I have noticed the following property that
&gt; speaks to the foundations of all this.
&gt; 
&gt; PROPERTY:  The new-KIF axiomatization for spans (and hypergraphs)
&gt; is strictly category-theoretic -- in the axiomatization of spans
&gt; all axioms are expressed in terms of category-theoretic (in my
&gt; approach, foundational) notions, such as the composition and
&gt; identity of large (class to class) functions or the pullback
&gt; of small sets, and no axioms use explicit logical KIF connectives
&gt; or quantification!  This seems to be a hallmark of the ontologies
&gt; in the lower-level structure (the lower metalevel) -- the ontologies
&gt; for true categories (not quasi-categories), whose object and morphism
&gt; collections are classes (not conglomerates).  In addition, no axioms in
&gt; the Span Ontology use explicit KIF terms from the basic KIF ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; This property, and my attempt to realize it for the lower
&gt; metalevel Classification Ontology, prompts the following question:
&gt; should this metalevel representation have a set-theoretic foundation
&gt; or a category-theoretic foundation?  As you would expect, these are
&gt; contentious issues.

I guess it all depends on what you should mean by "should".

1.  What sorts of data, or experience, or insight, or intuition,
    or revelation, or whatever, would conceivably bear on the
    choice of a foundation, for a person, or for a community?

2.  What sorts of problems initially instigated the shift,
    among a few hardy entrepreneurs or foolhardy ingenues,
    depending on who is telling the story, from a very shakey
    or a too, too solid foundation, as the case may be, on to
    the shores of "yet another grounds of working assumptions"?
    That is, what sorts of experiences, historically speaking,
    led some workers to become dissatisfied with the workaday
    workings of a prior 'a priori' foundation, enough to keep
    looking for still another modus operandi?  If you attempt
    to answer that question, you might just find that a large
    component of the answer is a matter of aesthetics, that is,
    some people will just be happy with what others are not,
    and others will just not like what some people do.

3.  What sorts of experience would bear on the next move, say,
    back to set theory, or on to something entirely different?

&gt; For instance, look at the following exchanges on the category list:
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/category/risc/catlist/goedel-cat">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/category/risc/catlist/goedel-cat</A>
&gt;
&gt; In particular, my problem with the universal set and functions
&gt; is probably the same mentioned by Colin McLarty in that exchange:
&gt; "Anyway, the problem here is that functions are hard to work with
&gt; in set theory with a universal set."  So perhaps I should heed his
&gt; advice and consider following the foundational approach described
&gt; in Benabou's theory of fibrations and definability [Benabou J. (1985).
&gt; "Fibered categories and the foundations].

Well, this is pretty heady stuff, and I happen to believe
that a little more fiber in our diet would be a good idea,
but, just for my own sanity, you understand, I am reduced
to seeking out the simplest non-trivial situations of any
reasonably computational ilk in which anything like these
phenomenally prodigious phenomena apparently arise at all.
Do you have in mind any problems that arise at that level?
