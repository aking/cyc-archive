&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose there is a sort of general,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metalinguistic schema here that exhibits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pattern that any such relation will fit,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something like (ignoring the uniqueness clause
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for brevity):
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (forall (?X1 ... ?Xn)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (REL ?X1 ... ?Xn)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;              (exists (?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (EVENT-TYPE ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (ROLE-1 ?e ?X1)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (ROLE-n ?e ?Xn)))))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But this is pretty useless, as the event types and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corresponding roles for relations still have to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analysed out piecemeal, relation by relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's no general principle or algorithm.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I protest:  this IS a general algorithm, if properly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stated.  The key is not to predicate 'event-type'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the ?e in question, but to connect it to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; original predication of REL, by mapping REL from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an n-ary to a unary relation REL': ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pat, you misunderstand, and please do not place
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me in the middle of all this triadicity nonsense.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was only interested, first, in helping Matthew
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get clear about the logical form of what he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to assert.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, so was I.  Matthew has been quite clear, I had thought,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the ?e in his example is to be thought of as a n-tuple.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I had been reading the email deluge too quickly.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Perhaps just a tad.  What I mean is that ?e stands for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;      same real world thing as the n-tuple.  I would be reluctant
&gt; &gt; &gt;      to draw from that that the ?e was an n-tuple.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Second, I was interested in the general idea behind
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew's attempt -- as a piece of *ontology* -- to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flesh out certain relations in terms of the occurrence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of certain events.  Thus, with regard to what I was doing --
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as opposed to what you *thought* I was doing -- the key is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *exactly* the predication of "EVENT-TYPE" of the ?e in question.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The interesting question for me here was simply when, if ever,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is a fruitful thing to do, ontologically.  That is, when,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if ever, is it fruitful to enlarge one's ontology to encompass
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events to give a fuller ontological analysis of a given relation?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *That* is what has to be decided "piecemeal", that is, by the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; careful analysis of a class of relations.  I was not talking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about what *can* be done logically -- I have agreed with you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the beginning of your debate with the triadicians that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the algorithm for translating from n-ary relations to unary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and binary relations is obvious and trivial -- but about
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether, when, and how a certain class of entity might
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; serve some useful ontological purpose.  Ok?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OK, OK.  But don't you see a rather close parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here?  The difference between writing (EVENT-TYPE ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and (R' ?e) doesnt seem to me to be worth making much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fuss about, particularly since the 'piecemeal' analysis
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that would need to be done would presumably establish
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *some*  kind of connection between the EVENT-TYPE in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question and the original REL.  If we utilise the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; syntactic freedom of revised KIF we could write
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both of these in the form ((MAPPING REL) ?e) and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then just have a side theory about MAPPING, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be as piecemeal or as uniform as one wanted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it to be able to get.  Some RELs might satisfy
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (EVENT-PROPERTY (MAPPING REL)) where (forall (?x ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (=&gt; (and (EVENT-PROPERTY ?x)(?x ?y)) (EVENT-TYPE ?y)))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while others might not.  But the mapping that Matthew
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted would work smoothly either way:  the ontological
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; status of the value of MAPPING would be an issue which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could be discussed separately.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay, kibbitzing on this pas de trois has helped me
&gt; &gt; to see a little more of what's going on here.  I was
&gt; &gt; going to comment on the details of what I see being
&gt; &gt; thrashed out here, but I think that I will take the
&gt; &gt; novel step of following my own advice to others, and
&gt; &gt; try to take two or three steps back, and speak to the
&gt; &gt; longer run view of things.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You are to be complimented for your persistence here,
&gt; &gt; and also for the realistic intuition that is leading
&gt; &gt; you to recapitulate in your ontogeny many aspects
&gt; &gt; of the perspective that has been developed in the
&gt; &gt; phyllogeny of mathematics and its applications to
&gt; &gt; dynamic systems.  And if anyone is responsible for
&gt; &gt; the fact that the underlying philosophy and working
&gt; &gt; attitude of this POV is not more widely appreciated
&gt; &gt; and recognized for what it is, I guess that I will
&gt; &gt; have to blame its generations of doctrinarians and
&gt; &gt; expositors who were apparently so concerned with
&gt; &gt; the appearances of their outer dress that they
&gt; &gt; would not dare to show you their workclothes.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Yes, accessibility of existing knowledge is
&gt;      a real problem that often leads one to solve
&gt;      the problem again as being a more efficient
&gt;      route to a solution than finding where it has
&gt;      already been discovered.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Still, I must repeat the suggestion that I have made before,
&gt; &gt; pointedly on the "Manifolds of Sensuous Impressions" thread,
&gt; &gt; that the very like of all of these issues have been tackled
&gt; &gt; before, if perhaps in a deliberately quantitative disguise.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, there are Realities and there are Representations.
&gt; &gt; Books have been written on the relation between these
&gt; &gt; two subjects, if not necessarily in that order.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any Reality to which we are likely to point, appreciated
&gt; &gt; in all of its glorious splendor, is just bound to be far
&gt; &gt; more complex and vastly more subtle than the likes of us
&gt; &gt; fallible and mortal finite information beings could ever
&gt; &gt; hope to express in full, and so we arch-typically allude
&gt; &gt; to it under the aegis of "X", our Persean Shield, if you
&gt; &gt; will.  Here is where, I am beginning to suspect, a brand
&gt; &gt; of misapprehension first arises between us, for you seem
&gt; &gt; to advert to this X, arrogated as a realm in reality, or
&gt; &gt; to its typical element x, conceived as an individual, as
&gt; &gt; if this move were a simple step, even a simplifying step,
&gt; &gt; in our approximal approach to the twined reality, x in X.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I have never felt the compulsion to be required to
&gt;      say everything about something as a prerequisite to
&gt;      recognising something's existence.  I expect to have
&gt;      to say enough about something so that others can
&gt;      distinguish the same object, and what ever it is
&gt;      that I wish to communicate about it, but not more.

My comment was directed to the question of what you "syntacticians"
intend by the various symbols that you introduce on the right side
of this purported definition, equivalence, or whatchamacallit this
very hour or minute.  You are a sensible person.  If you ask me to
define or to explain some problematic concept or term that I foist
on the discussion, and if my response is stated in terms of eleven
or twelve rather more problematic concepts or terms, then you will
immediately "smell a rat", as they say, and demand that I try once
again to reduce the total complicity of what I tender as definiens.
Thus, a person does not escape the charge of a circular definition
simply by placing primes on the recursed subsequent appearances of
the symbol or term to be defined, by conferring a diversionary new
alias upon it, or by changing its name to protect his innocence of
knowledge about the subject.  No, sensible people are not deceived
by callous gambits and shallow tricks such as these, now are they?

In the beginning I had been giving your party the benefit of the doubt,
assuming only that you were introducing the exact same relation on the
right as appeared on the left -- a somewhat common political stratagem --
only under a sleightly transmogrified name, like converting verb forms
to the corresponding gerunds, and other diverting derring doings, but
now I am begining to suspect that you are actually thinking that you
can get away with squirreling away a changeling, a still more mystic
predicate on the right than ever dared to show its face on the left --
a somewhat common political stratagem, too, sad to say.

&gt; MW:  I also pick up from between your comments that in logical
&gt;      circles "=" means precisely "stands for the same thing".
&gt;      We do not have such an operator in data modelling, so I
&gt;      have been applying a stricter test of "is the same thing".
&gt;      It is useful to know the local conventions.

I do not know what context you are referring to here.
The last time that I remember using an equal sign in
quotes it was merely to underscore a straightforward
reading of "is".  When questions of equality get any
more involved than that I will typically use several
standard devices, like "square bracket" operators to
signify "the denotation of" a sign or expression, or
subscripts on the equal signs that specify the exact
sense of equivalence that is meant in the given case.
