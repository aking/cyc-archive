Dear Chris,

Following up on Roberts questions.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for pressing me on this, Robert.  I think I see the 
&gt; source of the
&gt; confusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If classes are non-extensional then I don't see

&gt; &gt; &gt; is in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; having null.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing in the axioms entails that there is a null class.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is false, of course.  According to the axioms, 
&gt; every class has a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;complement, hence (complement top) is null.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ### No woman overboard, but note one can only prove 
&gt; this from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; axioms if both top and null are known to be unique. 
&gt; There is as yet no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; axiom or meta axiom to this effect (nor is it provable 
&gt; of course).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think you are confusing the property *null* (i.e., the 
&gt; property of
&gt; &gt; &gt;having no instances) with the class *nil*, Robert.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ### I am sure you are right, Chris. The confusion remains 
&gt; however after
&gt; &gt; this reply --actually it is greater, since neitehr the 
&gt; ontology nor my
&gt; &gt; query contain the notion of "property"...
&gt; 
&gt; A property (and hence, in the ontology, a class) is a 1-place 
&gt; relation;
&gt; sorry, this is such common terminology in my world that I didn't think
&gt; to make it explicit, which would have been a good idea.  
&gt; However, there
&gt; is at least an allusion to this usage of "property" in the informal
&gt; exposition:
&gt; 
&gt; ;; ... if we want to attribute some property to
&gt; ;; Cain's father, it is convenient to use functional notation:
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;                 (gardener (father-of cain))
&gt; 
&gt; I.e., the property of being a gardener is being attributed to 
&gt; the father
&gt; of Cain.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ...and the ontology only uses "nil" in the context of a 
&gt; null sequence.
&gt; 
&gt; Whoops, that was a boneheaded mistake on my part; I forgot my own
&gt; terminology: "null" is the name of our distinguished (NOT to 
&gt; say unique)
&gt; null class; as a class -- i.e., property -- it also has 
&gt; instances, viz.,

MW: Um that's not what you wrote:

(documentation "AXIOM: Nothing is an instance of null.")

(forall (?x)
        (not (instance-of ?x null)))

So null is just some named empty class, not the class of all empty classes.

However, you did define empty as a class with no members.

(forall (?cls (class ?cls))
        (&lt;=&gt; (empty ?cls)
             (not (exists (?x)
                          (instance-of ?x ?cls)))))

&gt; all the classes that have no instances.  "nil", as you note, 
&gt; is the name
&gt; of the empty sequence.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maybe I'm not alone with in this state of confusion.
&gt; 
&gt; Of which my blunder is at least a partial cause.  Sorry about that.
&gt; With this cleared up, I can see that there is an ambiguity in my
&gt; original statement.  I said that, according to the axioms, every class
&gt; has a complement and hence (complement top) is null.  But "(complement
&gt; top) is null" is ambiguous between (= (complement top) null) and (null
&gt; (complement top)).  

MW: I would agree that this concept might be more useful, though actually I 
think null would be a confusing name, because it is not the same (or even 
similar) to what is normally understood as null, since this patently does 
have members where as a traditional null would not.

&gt; I think you took me (quite reasonably) to mean the
&gt; former, but what I meant was the latter, and that is indeed provable
&gt; from the axioms: (null (complement top)) means that 
&gt; (complement top) has
&gt; no instances, which is provable from the axiom that everything is an
&gt; instance of top and the axiom for complement.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;The conclusion says only that (complement top) has the property of
&gt; &gt; &gt;being null, not that it is identical with the class nil.  Since
&gt; &gt; &gt;everything is an instance of top (axiom), nothing is an instance of
&gt; &gt; &gt;(complement top) (axiom for complement), i.e., it is null 
&gt; (axiom for
&gt; &gt; &gt;null).
&gt; 
&gt; The same ambiguity is present here.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ### Perhaps there are some hitherto undocumented properties of the
&gt; &gt; interpreter for KIF++ (I'm sure there are and that they need to
&gt; &gt; surface in fact), but I stand by my earlier comment that without
&gt; &gt; additional axioms and/or knowledge about the said interpreter it is
&gt; &gt; not possible to prove from
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (forall (?x) (instance-of ?x A)))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A equals top,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (= A top)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; depending on the imagined "semantics" of your interpreter.
&gt; 
&gt; I totally agree with this, and have said as much with regard 
&gt; to null in
&gt; the document: "Classes are not assumed to be extensional, 
&gt; that is, they
&gt; are not assumed to be identical if they have the same 
&gt; instances.  Hence,
&gt; we cannot define emptiness as identity with null (as there may be many
&gt; distinct empty classes)."  I hope the clarification above shows that I
&gt; have not denied this.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ### this said, let me tell you unequivocally and sincerely that I
&gt; &gt; think you did a great (and courageous) job in publishing this
&gt; &gt; cold-pressed extra-virgin ontology for all of us to peek &amp; poke at.
&gt; &gt; But since it's there I feel ok in poking at it, and even to be wrong
&gt; &gt; about that occasionally (but not this time though)
&gt; 
&gt; I am most grateful for your comments and criticisms.  They 
&gt; can only lead
&gt; to improvements.
