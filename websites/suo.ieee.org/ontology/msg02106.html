Graham,

I fully understand the magnitude of the forces behind the
MS monopoly:
&gt;While I agree with the thrust of your sentiments, and in any
&gt;case vastly preferred the logicality of WordPerfect, surely the driving
&gt;factor is that Microsoft has by far the bulk of the market, and many of us
&gt;are required to use the software corporately provided and mandated by our
IT
&gt;people.

That is why I never to accept any .doc document without registering a
protest.  Acquiesence simply reinforces a very unfortunate status quo. 

&gt;Where I do, and have previously, worked, use of
&gt;non-corporate software is prohibited without special case acceptance of a
&gt;business justification, and will be wiped from one's computer overnight if
&gt;attempted. 

That is why I recommend HTML.  It is universally available.  Although the
current browsers do not fully support the few available features (such as
Cascading Style Sheets v. 2) which can help overcome some of its
limitations, the world (including the Redmond monopoly) is moving toward XML
as the replacement for proprietary formats.

GH&gt;	We are talking of out Knowledgebase being redeveloped in XML, but I
have never had any contact with it. I take it XML flows in a reasonably
smooth way from HTML? 

&gt;The fact is they have the market sewn up for the time being.
&gt;I suggest this won't be overcome till serious analysis and response to the
&gt;matter occurs at either international level, such as WTO or similar, or in
&gt;the main economic groups, such as NAFTA, USA, EU, etc. 

There is something that everyone can do:
1.	Whenever possible, use HTML or plan text instead of .doc formats.

	GH&gt;	Good point. In my WordPerfect days I was a "power" user,
exploiting many formatting features. It really is a shame WordPerfect didn't
survive, since it had a good formatting paradigm also. HTML is even more
anaemic than Word in these aspects, but then I have had to trim my style for
e-mails anyway. What I haven't tried yet is to see whether using Word as my
e-mail editor would allow me to send my e-mails in HTML. 

2.	Whenever you receive a document in .doc format, request an HTML or
plain text form instead.

	GH&gt;	Will try this, and see how I go. 

3.	Make anyone in a position of power fully aware of the fact that
Microsoft is committed to making current .doc files obsolete-that is the
stated MS policy for .NET, which they are beginning to support with the beta
version of Windows XP and its follow-on for 2002.

	GH&gt;	That's a good way to get written off as a difficult person
to deal with. IT would complain long and loud. 

4.	Whenever an opportunity arises, recommend HTML or XML as the
preferred format for documents, spread sheets, etc.

GH&gt;	Will also try HTML tables. Do they support any mathematics like word
processors? 


&gt;My guess this won't happen for at least a half decade, no
&gt;matter how irritated little people like us may be irritated by it.

Whenever you get irritated, do your best to ensure that someone in a higher
position of power feels the irritation (of course, it is best to focus their
irritation on the source, rather than on you).

GH&gt;	I think people around here expect people to silently overcome all
such problems themselves and not bother anyone. Half the time, the IT
support response to a crash, etc. is "do it a way that doesn't causse the
problem", rather than fix the problem.
