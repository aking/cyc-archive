Pat, Robert, &amp; All,

Now that I have taken the trouble to trot out those
dusty old bits of material from Descartes and Kant,
I feel that it is probably time to return to their
points and to review them in place once again, but
on my own time, and probably another day.  I find
that I am much less fond of blaming or crediting
whole philosophical turns, not to mention entire
socio-cultural shifts, on this or that singular
thinker than I used to be, especially since the
direction of the movement that comes out of the
swerve frequently has so little to do with the
full force, life, moment, thrust, and work of
the thinker in question -- and so I begin to
believe that if academe, culture, or society
take off on a certain tangent, it is because
of the internal tensions that were bound up
and wound up within them, and that they are
looking for a catalyst, an excuse, a fuse,
a trigger, as it were.  But I digress ...

So let's just say, awaiting further study,
that these two sorts of "reductive" ideas
were very much "in the air" at this time,
and pretty much taken for granted before
Peirce arrived on the scene.  Descartes'
suggestion was doubly reductive, since
it followed on an earlier development
in his 'Regulae' where he recommends
the reduction of 'all', let's say a
significant class, of intellectual
problems to the simple matter of
taking the measures of extended
bodies in suitably dimensioned
spaces, that is, to sizing up
properly contrived incidence
arrays that represented the
issue that was to be known.

Now, one of the things that Peirce did throughout his work,
early and late, was to afford critiques of what was known
as the Cartesian and the Kantian philosophies, including
among their many-splendored facets just such notions as
I have highlighted here, leading people to take it for
granted that all extended bodies, which in Descartes'
very ingenious imagination manifested visual images
for k-place relations, could be taken dyadically,
one or two dimensions at a time, and still quite
adequately for all that, and also that the only
form of reasoning that we really have to worry
about, in the last analysis, as they say, was
au fond, in its fundamentals, just deduction.

To these innocent presumptions Peirce's critiques
presented quite a formidable challenge, though it
cannot be said that the shot was heard far &amp; wide.

But Tommorrow Is Still Another Day,
One Yet To Keep What I Have To Say.

Until Later,

Jon Awbrey
