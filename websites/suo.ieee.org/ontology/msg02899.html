Jon --

I do see that you've changed the subject of this thread, but I don't think
of myself as particularly audacious, in this particular discussion.  At
this late stage of my career, I feel particularly humbled that there is
apparently something so very fundamental and important that I can't get a
grasp on.

I'm not trying to solve the riddle of the Sphinx, as John Sowa has pointed
out as one of Peirce's great contributions.  I'm just hoping to facilitate
better communication among people, particularly in a commercial
environment, by using conceptual and technological tools to reduce the
levels of ambiguity that otherwise would exist without that effort.

I don't know if it helps to dwell on my thoughts, but I'll answer your
questions below, for what it's worth.  My main goal is not to defend what I
have written, but to use something that I do understand (because I've
written it) to come at something I don't understand, from the point of view
of how this is useful for the purpose I've expressed of facilitating
clearer and less ambiguous communication.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *********** Begin sign instance ***********
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sign:  "rose"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Referent:
&gt; &gt; Imaginary color (expressed in the French language)
&gt; &gt; of an imaginary (plastic?) disc, imagined to be used
&gt; &gt; as one of number of game pieces in an imaginary game
&gt; &gt; of Tower of Hanoi.
&gt;
&gt; When you say "imaginary color", which aspect of that
&gt; is the most important to you, the color or the image?

Neither.  What's important is the disc.  But it's also important that this
is
not an actual disc, in the context of a manufacturing process, physics
experiment, etc., but that it is an image of a disc being used in a thought
experiment of some kind.

&gt; If you want to talk about the property of a thing that we call its color,
&gt; then I would call this property an "object", merely because it is an
object
&gt; of discussion and thought, and thus an object of the signs that go into
this
&gt; process of talking and thinking.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to talk about the impression of a color that we have in our
minds,
&gt; then I would call this mental impression an "image", and I would tend to
treat it,
&gt; in the first instance, as a type of "sign", one that resides or flits
through the
&gt; minds of creatures like us -- though, of course, anything at all, even
this image,
&gt; becomes an object of discussion and thought as soon as anybody talks or
thinks
&gt; about it, like we are now.

This brings up exactly one of my points of confusion about Peirce.  You
have used
the phrase "discussion and thought" a couple of times, in a way that seems
to want
to conflate them.  In an earlier stab at understanding sign vs.
interpretant, I
stated that I thought sign was about utterance and interpretant (sign) was
about
bringing the sign, and the object of discussion together in the mind of the
interpreter.  Notice that I didn't say "human mind" just then, nor did I on
that
other occasion, though more than one reader interpreted me to have done so.
Before
I could correct that impression, a cascade of signs washed over the bow.

&gt; Now, I use the word "referent" in conformity with a whole user community
--
&gt; and this is an army somewhat larger than the paltry platoon of Peirceans
--
&gt; so take your pick, and pay the consequences of doing so.
&gt; (Do as we say -- and nobody will get hurt?)

I understand about reserved words, and I'm careful to use them carefully in
reserved contexts.  Which is why, for instance, I can't bring myself to use
"object" or "interpretant" just now, since I can't seem to get them clear
enough to make practical use of them in my area of concern.  Please note
that
I did not use "pragmatic", for the same reason.  I like to use that word as
a close synonym to practical, which does not seem to be the philosophical
definition.  In any event, I am using "referent" exactly in accordance with
the definition from my humble Webster, lying close to hand: "one that is
referred to; esp : the thing that a symbol (as a word or sign) stands for"
(a definition apparently established in 1884)

&gt; &gt; Sign emitter:  Josiane Caron-Pargue
&gt;
&gt; It is a popular option to parameterize signs by the various sorts of
agents
&gt; that bear them in various sorts of ways, where "agent" can mean a
community,
&gt; a person, an animal, a machine, a divinity, and so on.  I have just
sought
&gt; to transmit to you what I consider to be the benefit of my experience,
and
&gt; the benefit of what my experience has taught me is a quantum of good
advice
&gt; from Peirce, that this particular way of doing things will ultimately
lead to
&gt; despair, but then, I did not take Peirce's advice either until after I
had gone
&gt; out and personally experienced some of this despair.  So it goes.  At any
rate,
&gt; you may consider the fact that the particular role of transmitter or
receiver
&gt; is of secondary importance here, since people are always talking to
themselves
&gt; as they to talk to others, if you catch my drift.

I'm not sure about this despair.  Again, from a practical point of view,
I'm not
really concerned with how we think, internal dialogs, etc. in my own dialog
with
the SUO study group.  It is my opinion that we can make progress on certain
practical objectives without resolving whether the brain is actually
processing
signs.  For this purpose, my personal preference would be that we should
reserve
"sign" to mean externalized utterance, where utterance is generalized to
include
verbal, graphic, alphabetic, etc.  With a special emphasis on utterance
captured
and transmitted via computer-based networks for the purpose of amplifying
and
directing communication among human beings.

Given this last paragraph, I should also stop using the word "sign" on this
list,
because it clearly has a reserved meaning for some that doesn't match the
meaning
I tend to assign.

&gt; &gt; Purpose:  Illustration of a technique for analyzing certain kinds of
discourse
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (??)
&gt;
&gt; Purpose is good.  But consider this, for a pragmatic thinker "purpose" is
&gt; a synonym for "object", that is, "objective" (aim, business, concern,
end,
&gt; goal, intention, interest, 'pragma').  All of which raises an interesting
&gt; question:  What is the relationship of this "big object", that is to say,
&gt; the "big idea", the overall objective that an agent is directed toward,
&gt; to the "bit object", in the present case, the property that is being
&gt; talked or thought about at the moment in question?
&gt;
&gt; In this connection, one of the reasons why 3-adic relations are so
important
&gt; is that they are what it takes for you to focus on a "little object"
without
&gt; losing track of the "big object" of which it forms a part, in other
words,
&gt; to put your effort into getting from A to B without forgetting that you
&gt; were doing this order to get from A to Z.

This is what I thought, but it has tended to get obscured (in my opinion)
in
the long debates about reduction of triads to dyads.  Maybe to say it
another
way, an issue of communication has tended to get lost in a discussion of
representation.  I don't know if this is true, it just strikes me as
possible.
It seems to me that expression of the big object is important to provide
context
for the bit stream, but then would not have to be repeated for every bit
that is
subsequently emitted.  This, of course, is an oversimplification, since in
real
communication the context continuously emerges as the bit stream(s) emerge
and
interact.

&gt; &gt; Occasion of emission:
&gt; &gt; E-mail message on a discussion list of a working group
&gt; &gt; of an international standards body, distributed to the
&gt; &gt; list on 18 May, 2001.
&gt;
&gt; You may, of course, add as many additional parameters as you wish.
&gt; But are they necessary to the programme, or merely excess baggage?
&gt; That is, what is the appropriate level of abstraction for what we
&gt; are trying to get at here?

Again, I'm not aiming at the riddle of the Sphinx here, or any grand
psychological
or philosophical theory.  Just probing with some blunt prods to see what
connection
I can make with my way of seeing the problem.  I'll be so callow as to
admit that
I had hoped to express my concerns in six dimensions, so that I could begin
the
thread with the catchier subject line "Irreducible Sexadicity".

But, I do think that when a sign is emitted is a critical aspect of
context.  Just
take a look back through the Peircean scholarship to see how often there
are
discussions of *when* he said what he said, shedding light because it was
either
before or after he said something else, in a certain stage of various
debates with
his contemporaries.  In business emission of externalized utterance (my
ugly term
for what I really can't mean as "sign"), the order and timing of emission
is very much
of the essence of meaning and communication.

&gt; &gt; Medium:
&gt; &gt; E-mail, including multiple servers, software protocols, screen display,
etc.
&gt;
&gt; Ditto.

Relatively ditto from me back atcha.  Though not in the sense of something
that needs
to be explicitly stated.  The medium, whether billboard, magazine page, or
screen
pixels, while important, is also self-evident.

&gt; &gt; Understanding:
&gt; &gt; The symbol "rose" standing metonymously
&gt; &gt; for a pink imaginary disc in an imaginary game.
&gt;
&gt; Now I used to think I knew what "metonymy" meant.
&gt; Toward what purpose do you purpose the word here?
&gt; According to the correspondence between my sight
&gt; and my understanding this very word "rose" marks
&gt; a hue that by any other name would blush as pink.

Again, I'm using it in the standard sense of "a figure of speech consisting
of the use
of the name of one thing for that of another of which it is an attribute or
with which
it is associated".  I'm not talking about the correspondence between "rose"
and "pink"
here, but rather my belief that rose or pink are being used as a shorthand
reference to
the disc of that color in the imaginary Tower of Hanoi game under
discussion.

&gt; &gt; Intended recipient(s) of sign:
&gt; &gt; Participants in the e-mail list of a working group of an international
standards body.
&gt;
&gt; Does this affect the meaning of the French word "rose"?

It absolutely affects the big and bit object of that word in the instance
of use.

&gt; &gt; *********** End sign instance ***********
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Notice that this example is created from the point of view of the sign
emitter,
&gt; &gt; rather than the sign recipient.  I am just now realizing that this may
be a major
&gt; &gt; disconnect between what you are trying to do and what I hope to
accomplish through
&gt; &gt; participation in SUO.  Your work seems to be centered on inquiry, where
my concern
&gt; &gt; is communication.
&gt;
&gt; If you never reach a point in the process of communication
&gt; where disagreement, misunderstanding, or uncertainty arises,
&gt; or even has the future prospect of arising, then the topic
&gt; of inquiry will not have any relevance to you.  Otherwise,
&gt; you will find yourself soon engaged in a problematic that
&gt; has a remarkable formal similarity to that covered under
&gt; the heading of "inquiry", whatever name you call it by.

I agree that inquiry is intrinsic.  My only point is that you seem to
working from the
position of the inquirer, who is trying to make sense of an otherwise
undifferentiated
field of sign impressions, where I'm working in an area of situated
purposeful
communications, where a lot of the context is known by all parties, but
further progress
stands to be made via the conceptual and technological tools I alluded to
above.  This
harks back to our earlier discussion of the Pynchon references to
philately, which I
agreed were interesting to think about, but not likely to cause problems of
ambiguity in
the context of the example provided by Matthew West (I think).

&gt; &gt; For the kind of issues I am trying to address e.g. commercial
transactions
&gt; &gt; among humans, using computer and telecommunications networks) I think
that
&gt; &gt; it is much more possible to address the problem from the point of view
of
&gt; &gt; what's going on with emitters than recipients of signs.  We're much
more
&gt; &gt; likely to be able to identify them, and to actually inquire into what
is
&gt; &gt; going on in their minds with respect to purposes and understandings.
&gt;
&gt; I am tempted not to answer at this point.
&gt; That would teach you not to consider the
&gt; recipient.  Instead I will emit this bit
&gt; of a reply to remind you how dialectical
&gt; are these entangled aspects of dialogues.

Again, I think this is a manifestation of the difference between your more
general,
and my more specific domains of concern for this particular work effort
(IEEE SUO).

&lt; snipped mirror image example&gt;

&gt; &gt; *  In a very real sense every sign is irreducible with respect to these
&gt; &gt;    eight aspects (sign, referent, emitter, recipient, occasion, medium,
&gt; &gt;    purpose understanding).
&gt;
&gt; Proof?

Not now, and probably not ever, in the sense of proof I've come to
understand you
to require.

&gt; &gt; *  Some of the aspects may be unknown at various points in time,
&gt; &gt;    or unknowable external to an individual sign emitter or recipient.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *  The medium tends to be common between emitter and recipient (sound
waves,
&gt; &gt;    magazine page, billboard, etc., with more variation possible in the
instance
&gt; &gt;    of computer networks).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *  There is complexity within each of these aspects, but most
especially
&gt; &gt;    with respect to purposes and understandings.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *  Correspondence among understandings has a lot to do with
&gt; &gt;    correspondence (or symmetry) among purposes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *  The general purpose for efforts like SUO, in my opinion, has to do
specifically
&gt; &gt;    with helping to line up understandings between emitters and
recipients.  It is
&gt; &gt;    because of the ambiguity of signs based on implicit and mismatched
understandings
&gt; &gt;    that we want to devise schemes for making dimensions of
understanding explicit,
&gt; &gt;    so that signs will be interpreted identically (or at least
similarly) by multiple
&gt; &gt;    recipients, and in correspondence with the purpose of the emitter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For instance, the Tower of Hanoi is not really a discussion of the
spectral analysis
&gt; &gt; of color, but rather imaginary discs that are distinguished by color,
such that the
&gt; &gt; dimensions of understanding will not line up properly without placing
them in the
&gt; &gt; ontology of imagined molecular objects, rather than the ontology of
color terms.
&gt;
&gt; I think that you may have forgotten about the "Dialogue In Nature" (DIN),
&gt; that we have so much less ability to shout down and to gain control over.

I would say it's not so much forgotten, as it is that I simply have a less
ambitious
objective.  I'm willing to assume that virtually all of the din of the
universe of signs
has been filtered, and that I aspire merely to provide incremental clarity
to those
business emissions of externalized utterance that are somewhat, but not
infinitely,
problematic at the current time.  Maybe an extracted essence of Charles
Sanders Peirce
may in the end prove helpful to me in this limited (but challenging)
objective.  Or not.

Thanks for your thoughtful response.

Doug
