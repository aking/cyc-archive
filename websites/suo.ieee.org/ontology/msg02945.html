Chris, and other reificators.

If you are barking at the wrong tree, we are a pack of hounds down there :)
Being at the Paris reunion where reification made its come back, and having
supported it heartily, I want to second.
What is common to RDF and XTM may be limited to the reification of a
statement, either in the technical sense it has in RDF, either in the sense
that an XTM &lt;association&gt; represents a &quot;natural language statement&quot;.
XTM goes further on, allowing to reify (making a topic proxy of) anything
you can speak, write, think,
dream about, be it a statement or anything else ...
But it's altogether consistent IMO, and I think there is a growing consensus
about it in the semantic web community at least.

Cheers

Bernard

&gt; In the case of XTM the use of the term 'reification' had been abandonned
&gt; because of its perceived general misuse.  It came back into use at the
Paris
&gt; meeting (as indicated by Steve Pepper) because it appeared to more
&gt; accurately reflect what part of the conceptual model needed to say.  In a
&gt; topic map topics exist, but the subjects that they represent are
themselves
&gt; abstract (although they may have physical manifestations).  We can form
&gt; associations between topics, we may also want to refer to some
associations
&gt; between topics as if they were topics.  At a data modelling level this can
&gt; lead one to simply treat 'association between topics' as a subclass of
&gt; 'topic'.  But this leads to problems, in particular it is not necessarily
&gt; appropriate to have an association inherit from topic because, in a
general
&gt; case, properties of a topic are not all applicable in the case of an
&gt; association.  What it really comes down to is that the association can
rank
&gt; alongside other subjects and can be converted to (or reified into) a
topic.
&gt; The topic and the association are thus distinct and one is not a subclass
of
&gt; the other.
&gt;
&gt; To me the process of reification is that of converting a statement (which
is
&gt; an abstraction) into a thing or entity in its own right in order that it
may
&gt; become the subject of some other statement.  It is often the equivalent of
&gt; the device of placing a statement in single quotes in order to distinguish
&gt; between that part of a sentence that is in the metalanguage and that which
&gt; is in the object language.
&gt;
&gt; Do you think that I am 'barking up the wrong tree'?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not clear whether you are simply making the point that the term
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'reification' has become rather overused and abused, or whether you
are
&gt; &gt; &gt; stating that you believe it is being incorrectly applied in the case
of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Topic Maps and XTM 1.0.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that the intended usage in XTM is fully consonant with its
&gt; &gt; &gt; traditional usage in philosophy and linguistic semantics.  If you do
&gt; &gt; &gt; not agree perhaps you might like to explain why.

&gt; &gt; Chris,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have posted a collection of materials on the intertwined matters
&gt; &gt; of hypostatic abstraction, reflection, reification, subjecture, and
&gt; &gt; thematization, and I will post more later as I find it.  This ranges
&gt; &gt; from tidbits that I have collected over many years, to discussions
&gt; &gt; that I had last year on the Peirce, CG, SemioCom, and SUO Lists,
&gt; &gt; to links that I have run across more recently.  In character it
&gt; &gt; crosses the spectrum from standard definitions, as used in the
&gt; &gt; human sciences and philosophy, from hermeneutics to logic, to
&gt; &gt; my own ideas worked out in dialogue, to recent uses in web
&gt; &gt; and computer science settings.  My sense that the words in
&gt; &gt; question have begun to be corrupted in their meaning is an
&gt; &gt; impression that I get from what I hear a whole lot of folks
&gt; &gt; saying of late, and not from what might be writ in specs.
&gt; &gt; It is prefectly possible that there remains a common wit
&gt; &gt; here that is yet to be saved, but the odds are against it
&gt; &gt; from what I have seen.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The place of &quot;hypostatic abstraction&quot; (HA) in forming the creation
&gt; &gt; of formal objects and mathematical ideas is an especially important
&gt; &gt; topos for me to defend.  No doubt it is destined to be my Alamo,
&gt; &gt; under any name.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me know if any of these notes resonate with your own
&gt; &gt; sense of what is crucial in the concept of reification.
&gt; &gt;
