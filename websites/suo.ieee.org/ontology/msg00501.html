I strongly support what John Sowa has to say here.

I will just add a reply to Matthew that in my mind my words describing the
three concepts were based on the naive realism assumption to refer to the
real world as far as is possible.  I can see how they can be interpreted as
referring to representations of the real world, but I recommend avoiding
this.  I would also point out that John Velman's response to my
contribution, although in some sense was a useful paraphrase of my words,
in fact has moved strongly to referring to the representation rather than
the real world.  I show extracts of both below for comparison.

Bottom line (in NL at least, but I think SUO/KIF too)) is try to write as
if it is the real world is the referent, even the way you have to write it
is predicated on a particular style of representation.  This may sound like
a "cop out", but for me it is more a "sleight of hand" that works.

Yours, Martin

&gt; 1. A generic relationship concept (e.g. Customer), sometimes called
&gt; relationship type
&gt;
&gt; 2. A specific instance of a relationship concept (e.g. Martin

&gt;
&gt; 3. A population of relationship instances (e.g. all customers

JV words
A relation of arity n, n&gt;0,  is symbolized as predicate with n arguments.
The extension of a relation of arity 1 is the set of things in the domain
of quantification
for which the predicate is true.  The  extension of a relation of arity n&gt;1
is the
subset of the nfold cartesian product of the domain of quantification for
which
the predicate is true.

A relationship is an instance of a relation.    E.g.,  married(X,Y)
describes a relation.
married(Bill, Hillary) describes a relationship.

Matthew, Mike, et al.,

That is a very serious and very difficult question:

&gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call what it is in the
real

&gt;world that they refer to?

As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box
of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
Java, etc.

But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they
refer to in the real world?" all hell breaks loose.

You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?

Suggestion:

 1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
    interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
    satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
    is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.

 2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
    purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
    realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
    words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
    let's not worry too much about what it is.

 3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
    the position that KIF is the official language to be used
    for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
    If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.

I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out"
that doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the
same cop out that Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his
Tractatus:  "Everything that can be said can be said clearly,
and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent."

For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some
extra prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in
the SUO] can be said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot
speak [in KIF], thereof we must be silent.

This is not an answer to the question of what do relations
really refer to.  It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the
only kind of cop out that will allow us to get some work done.

John Sowa
