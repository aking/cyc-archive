Bob, 
	.	Having looked at the website, and seem the pre-eminent
status given a "Document being worked on by this Working Group", I see valid
reasons for your concern.  

	.	Naturally, many of us want to encourage Ian Niles, Matthew
West and Robert Kent, as well as the prospect of somehow including the Cyc
ontology. However, that doesn't mean any one of them will necessarily turn
out to be either the core, or even necessarily part, of the final product
that turns out to have the robust structure we need. I suggest, for the best
product to result from this project, we have to maximise the opportunity for
highest quality, robust and generic ontology to emerge. This requires due
and balanced consideration be given all candidates, and so pre-eminence is
not appropriate. 

	.	I have always wondered why there is a need to have a
pre-eminent document at such an early stage. NONE of us can possibly
adjudicate, at this stage, which candidate structure will finish up with the
necessary soundness to constitute an appropriate final product. 

	.	As a result I now support your move to remove the formal
pre-eminent status of any particular product(s). 

	.	Furthermore, I think it is generally agreed that the ballot
caused a lot of unnecessary acrimony, and was hardly decisive in its
outcome. I think many feel it shouldn't have occurred at such an early stage
(even Jim acknowledged that). Up to now I was happy to live with it, but now
I see the risk of the current outcome swaying the long-term prospects for
the project settling on the best final product. 

	.	For these reasons, I support your call for a ballot to
resolve the contentious situation that evidently exists. 

	.	Personally, I would be happy that such a ballot require a
2/3rds majority, since I feel that demonstrates an adequately substantial
direction of opinion. 

	.	I also support the sort of careful additional considerations
John has suggested for the motion below. I feel this is an opportunity to
set up a sound ontology candidacy structure, and such additional controls
can assist that aim.

Bob,

I like that proposal, and I would vote for it.  But I would suggest two
clarifications:  (1) decide on some name for the submissions, such as
"working paper" or "expert contribution"; and (2) clarify the status of
"member".  Right now, there are three categories of people who have been
participating:

 1. People who have attained voting rights in the SUO process.

 2. Those who are on the waiting list for voting rights.

 3. Those who have been occasionally reading the messages,
    occasionally submitting a comment, but not yet sure what
    level of participation they would like to commit to.

I would suggest that: 
*	Anyone in group #1 should be able to submit such a document and/or
serve as the technical editor. 
*	Anyone in group #2 could be the technical editor of such a document,
but would have to get someone in group #1 to submit it.  
*	Anyone in group #3 would have to apply for #2 status and get someone
in #1 to submit it.

_______________________________________________________________

&gt;Motion:  Request for adoption by general (unanimous) consent.
&gt;
&gt;Resolved: Any member of the IEEE SUO Working Group may post a document
&gt;to the SUO web page as a "Document being worked on by this Working
&gt;Group."  The member who posts a document is presumptively the technical
&gt;editor of the document and by posting agrees to perform this role or
&gt;alternatively name another member who agrees to perform the role of
&gt;technical editor.  No vote will be required to post a document or name
&gt;an editor.
&gt;
&gt;The statement  "All documents posted are deemed to have equal status and
&gt;no document has any preferred position over any other document." will
&gt;precede the list of documents.

</PRE>
