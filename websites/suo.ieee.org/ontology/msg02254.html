&gt; Here are some mathematical definitions
&gt; for some algebraic structures that might
&gt; be helpful in some of the current SUO
&gt; discussion threads.  What I present below
&gt; is well-known and reasonably standard in
&gt; category-theoretic circles, and corresponds
&gt; somewhat to the discussion:
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm#Representing">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm#Representing</A>
&gt;
&gt; of John Sowa on "representing relations by graphs".
&gt; However, here I give the precise definitions from
&gt; a category-theoretic standpoint.  There are several
&gt; definitions for the hypergraph concept, but here we
&gt; start with the definition of an unlabelled hypergraph
&gt; used by John Sowa in the document mentioned above,
&gt; which we then generalize.  I have already defined
&gt; ontologies for (the categories of) spans (hypergraphs)
&gt; and binary relations using the new KIF (SUO-KIF).
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; A *graph* G = [E, N, s, t] consists of
&gt; a set of nodes N and set of edges E and
&gt; two (total) functions, a source function
&gt; s: E -&gt; N and a target function t : E -&gt; N.
&gt; We often picture the graph G as the following
&gt; diagram in the category Set, of sets and functions.
&gt; 
&gt;     s
&gt;    --&gt;
&gt;  E    N
&gt;    --&gt;
&gt;     t
&gt; 
&gt; This picture is a little hard to make using just ascii text.
&gt; 
&gt; If e is an edge in E with source node a = s(e) and
&gt; target node b = t(e), we often picture this as
&gt; 
&gt;    e
&gt;  a -&gt; b
&gt; 
&gt; Some things to note:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  The two diagram above are on two different levels --
&gt;     the first in the category Set, the second in the graph G.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  There are no constraints between the edge set E and the node set N;
&gt;     they could either overlap or be disjoint; they could even be identical.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  There may be any number of edges between any two nodes;
&gt;     although two edges e1 and e2 share the same source and
&gt;     target nodes, they are abstract things, not necessarily
&gt;     distinct labels for two different relations between the
&gt;     nodes.
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; A binary (dyadic) *relation* R between two sets A and B is a subset of
&gt; the Cartesian product set AxB;  that is, R \subset AxB.  We can refer to
&gt; the set A as the domain of R and the set B as the codomain of R;  then we
&gt; say that relation R is from domain A to domain B.  The terminology source
&gt; and target can be also used for domain and codomain, respectively.  However,
&gt; these may be on a different (category-theoretic and foundational) level than
&gt; the source and target of graph edges.  Initially, it may be a little unclear
&gt; how to relate relations and graphs.  The appropriate way is through the concept
&gt; of a span.
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; A *span* S from domain set A to codomain set B is a set of edges E
&gt; and two (total) functions, a source function s : E -&gt; A and a target
&gt; function t : E -&gt; B.  Speaking in terms of graphs, we can regard the
&gt; sets A and B as two sets of nodes.
&gt; 
&gt; Some things to note:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  There are no constraints between the edge set E and
&gt;     the node sets A and B;  they could either overlap,
&gt;     be disjoint, or even be identical.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Any graph G is a span, where the two node sets
&gt;     are identical A = B = N.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  Any binary relation R can be embedded as a span S(R) --
&gt;     the edge set is R, the node sets are A and B, and the
&gt;     source and target functions are the projection functions:
&gt;     when edge (a, b) is a member of R, then s(a, b) = a and
&gt;     t(a, b) = b.
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; A *hypergraph* H (preliminary version) consists of
&gt; a set N of nodes and a set A of (hyper)arcs.  Here,
&gt; as distinct from graphs, each arc in E may have an
&gt; arbitrary number of endpoint nodes.  Represent the
&gt; fact that arc e has endpoint node n by saying that
&gt; the pair (e, n) is a member of H.  This means that
&gt; H is just a binary relation from domain set A to
&gt; codomain set N, and hence is a special case of
&gt; a span.
&gt;
&gt; Let us generalize by equating hypergraphs with spans
&gt; (perhaps this corresponds to John Sowa's labelled hypergraphs??);
&gt; that is, a (generalized) *hypergraph* H consists of a set of
&gt; connectors or indices E, a set of domain nodes or hyperarcs A,
&gt; a set of codomain nodes or ordinary nodes N, and two functions,
&gt; a source function s : E - &gt; A from connectors to hyperarcs and
&gt; a target function from connectors to (ordinary) nodes.
&gt; 
&gt; Some things to note:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Hypergraphs can represent multivalent relations,
&gt;     where each hyperarc of a hypergraph represents one
&gt;     n-tuple or relationship among n entities in the set
&gt;     of nodes N, and the connectors between hyperarcs and
&gt;     nodes represent the roles.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. So for the case
&gt; 
&gt; (gives John Mary book)
&gt; 
&gt; with correponding expression
&gt; 
&gt; (exists (?e)
&gt;     (and (giving ?e)
&gt;          (giver ?e John)
&gt;          (receiver ?e Mary)
&gt;          (given ?e book)))
&gt; 
&gt; one interpretation might be as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; at the level of instances
&gt; 
&gt; '(gives John Mary book)' and '?e' are hyperarcs,
&gt; 'John', 'Mary' and 'book' are ordinary nodes,
&gt; 'giver', 'receiver' and 'given' (or 'agent',
&gt; 'patient' and 'thematic object') are connector (types);
&gt; 
&gt; whereas 'gives' and 'giving' occur at the level of hyperarc types.

Robert,

You have pointed to some topics that could be:

1.  A lot of fun, and maybe even useful to discuss.

2.  A can of worms that will make the trials of
    triadicity look like a stroll in the park.

It will be up to us how we conduct ourselves --
as a grad student I always found it amusing the
moments of near fisticuffs that would break out
at graph theory conferences over terminology,
but recent experiences hereabouts have taken
a lot of the humor out of such events for me --
so this will be my generic plea for tolerance,
while I still have a modicum of equanimity intact.

On the other had, this whole subfield of mathematics, one that
is very much applied in computer science, could provide us with
a useful test case for whether we will be able to support any
measures of inter-communicability and inter-operability among
diverse dialects and sundry perspectives on a more or less
common and shared object domain.

I think that it is accurate to say that there is no such thing
as a "standard dialect", universally accepted and adopted for
all graph theory work.  However, in my own experience I have
come to classify the principal dialects that are familiar to
me into three broad families, which I will name as follows,
after the type of mathematical object that each one appears
to treat as having a preferential status, with every other
sort of mathematical object being regarded as derivative
on this primary arche-type:

1.  The Set-Theoretic Dialects
2.  The Graph-Theoretic Dialects
3.  The Category-Theoretic Dialects

I have chanted all of the standard mantras with gurus of each persuasion,
if perhaps with an emphasis on the second style of disciplinary contortion,
but though I am currently the most interested in the third way of seeing
things, I think that it is fair to say that this last manner of speaking
is the one where the figures of speech are presently tied down the least.

So if we are going to open up this particular barrel,
I think that it might be a good idea to back up just
a little, and take the long view, before the monkeys
explode into space.

Que será,

Jon
