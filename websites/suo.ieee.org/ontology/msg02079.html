Dear Chris,

&gt; 
&gt; Greetings, Matthew.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I'm not sure it's wise to equivocate on "extension" 
&gt; as you do:
&gt; &gt; &gt; the extension of an individual for you is (I take it) 
&gt; something like
&gt; &gt; &gt; a 4D chunk of space-time, while the extension of a set is 
&gt; the set of
&gt; &gt; &gt; its members (i.e., the set itself).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Correct.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Granted, for you, both types of extension are used to individuate
&gt; &gt; &gt; objects of the relevant sort, but to avoid confusion perhaps it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; better to talk instead about, e.g., the spatio-temporal 
&gt; *extent* or
&gt; &gt; &gt; *boundaries* (or the like) of an individual, rather than its
&gt; &gt; &gt; extension.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Interestingly, I am also being criticised by others for not
&gt; &gt; making more of extension as being a common concept across class
&gt; &gt; and individual where whole/part and subtype/supertype can be seen
&gt; &gt; as the same.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that is a pretty poor criticism.  Far from being a 
&gt; common concept
&gt; across class and individual, class extension and individual extension
&gt; are two completely different concepts that just happen to 
&gt; share the same
&gt; name.  I think this is rather obvious.  One has to do with chunks of
&gt; space-time, the other with sets.

MW: I agree with the difference you point up. On the other hand the analogy
between the two uses is also very strong, and I'm sure gives rise to the 
use of the word for both these purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction if I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not) the key constructs in KIF are: - constants - variables (and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more generally lambda calculus)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nope, there is no variety of lambda calculus in KIF.  (And I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; puzzled why you think the lambda calculus is a 
&gt; generalization of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; notion of a variable.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Well I may have misunderstood what Lambda Calculus is about, in
&gt; &gt; which case this is a good opportunity to learn my mistake.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that variable expressions like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (forall ?x (=&gt; (car ?x) (has-wheels ?x)))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; were lambda expressions largely because they did involve variables.
&gt; &gt; Please explain my error.
&gt; 
&gt; The expression above is simply a sentence in a particular first-order
&gt; language.  A lambda expression is a property-denoting (or 
&gt; function-, or
&gt; relation-denoting, depending on the flavor of lambda calculus)
&gt; expression involving an abstraction operator, usually written as a
&gt; lambda.  Thus, for example, in the typed lambda calculus, the 
&gt; expression
&gt; [lambda x (exists y) Rxy] would denote the property of being something
&gt; that bears the relation R to something, or, viewed extensionally, the
&gt; set of all things e such that, for some object e', the pair 
&gt; &lt;e,e'&gt; is an
&gt; element of the relation R.  (I'm mingling use and mention here a bit,
&gt; but never mind.)

MW: Oh good. Then I deduce this is something I don't need. I've also
re-read the bit on Lambda Calculus in John's book, and it is quite clear
I have been reading far to much into what Lambda Calculus is about.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Yes. I know I need that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (and, I take it, your quantification theory is first-order).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: As I'm sure you know, this is beyond my knowledge. If I assume
&gt; &gt; that a quantification theory that is higher order implies a 
&gt; logic that
&gt; &gt; is higher order, then my position is as follows. I believe (because
&gt; &gt; people like you tell me) that there are significant advantages to
&gt; &gt; staying first order.
&gt; 
&gt; Or close to it.  There is a proposal before the KIF WG that provides a
&gt; semantics for sequence variables that gives KIF a bit more expressive
&gt; kick, albeit something quite a bit less than full second-order logic.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Therefore my preference is to remain first order until it can be
&gt; &gt; demonstrated that critical requirements can not be satisfied without
&gt; &gt; moving from that. You have said that these situations should not
&gt; &gt; occur, or can be overcome, and I will buy that until the contrary is
&gt; &gt; proved.  (see how trusting I am!)
&gt; 
&gt; Or naive! :-)  Overall, yes, there seems little need to go beyond
&gt; first-order, though the additional expressive power that sequence
&gt; variables give to KIF comes in very handy for certain things.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  - predication is used for set membership.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; You mean you model predication in terms of set membership in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; usual way?  Ok.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Yes, but I think in general a predicate is used as a property,
&gt; 
&gt; In my idiolect (not shared by all, especially John Sowa -- hi John!),
&gt; this makes no sense.  A predicate is a linguistic thingy, a 
&gt; property is
&gt; a semantic (or ontological) thingy that can be expressed by a 
&gt; predicate.
&gt; But in any case, I'm not sure what it means to "use" anything "as a
&gt; property."

MW: Ah! that's what (at least you think) a predicate is. Just to check,
a predicate is a predicate because of where it is (first element inside
the bracket of a KIF statement)?

MW: By property I mean an intensional class/set with perhaps varying
membership, and by "use" I mean that is what I put in that place 
(treating predicate as a name for the place in a KIF statement).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; where this can be true at one time, and not at another. I 
&gt; do not need
&gt; &gt; this, since 4D takes time into account already.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  - how one individual stands to another is modelled by relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  instances
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; You mean you model one thing x standing in relation R to another
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing y by including the pair &lt;x,y&gt; in the set that 
&gt; represents (or,
&gt; &gt; &gt; is identical with) R (again, in the usual way)?  Ok.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I said individual, you said thing. I meant only individuals, sp
&gt; &gt; not classes/sets. (but see below).
&gt; 
&gt; But if classes/sets are in the domain of quantification, then they can
&gt; stand in relations to other things, individuals or not.  So I 
&gt; think you
&gt; want to use the more general term "thing" here.

MW: I agree technically. Trying not to use them is about style and not
substance.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    note: only binary relations are used.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems bizarre to me to limit oneself in principle to binary
&gt; &gt; &gt; relations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I do not set it as a restriction, it is onloy an observation.
&gt; 
&gt; Of what?

MW: In the EPISTLE Core Model we have managed quite well using only
binary relations (as opposed to tables with two columns).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Giving, for example, is a very natural 3-place relation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Giving is an activity, an activity is a spatio-temporal 
&gt; extent, so
&gt; &gt; an individual, so represented by a constant, not a relation. This is
&gt; &gt; part of the consisttency I was talking about.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I think you are confusing giving with an instance of giving.
&gt; Granted, an instance of giving is an activity.  But giving is an
&gt; abstract relation -- the relation that three things a, b, and 
&gt; c stand in
&gt; when a gives b to c.  

MW: A good point. Because I come from database land I tend to focus
on what I need to store, rather than what things I can say. So I 
completely agree that giving &lt;a,b,c&gt; is fine as a relation. However,
If I store the information about the giving activity, this is a 
relation I can always reconstruct when I need it by creating an
appropriate SQL query on the activity. On the other hand
the reverse is not always true. The giving relation does not have
complete information about the giving activity (e.g. when it happened).

&gt; You distinguish between, say, the 
&gt; redness of this
&gt; apple (i.e., an instance of redness) and redness per se, don't you?

MW: Actually no we don't. We would just identify a state of this apple
and classify it as red. We used to model what you describe by aspects,
so there would be a colour aspect of an apple and that aspect would be
red. However, we discovered that this was redundant, and that simply
classifying states contained the same information, and gave a 
significantly simpler model.

&gt; Same distinction applies with giving, don't you think?

MW: If it does, it might explain why I find it uninteresting.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    This is principally to minimise structural constraints where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    all places in a relation must be filled, when some are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    known.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This makes no sense to me whatever.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: This is about data modelling issues, not logic issues, and if it
&gt; &gt; doesn't make sense, can be safely ignored (unless you design
&gt; &gt; databases).
&gt; 
&gt; Ok.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  - lambda calculus is used for defining constraints.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are two major varieties of lambda calculus -- typed and
&gt; &gt; &gt; untyped -- and I don't see that either is needed, or even usable,
&gt; &gt; &gt; for ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I may misunderstand what Lambda Calculus is about...
&gt; 
&gt; You do.  Or you did.  :-)

MW: I'm getting there. I don't need it is the main thing I understand.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The typed lambda calculus is basically just omega-order logic
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Omega-order logic? You lost me.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, there's second-order logic, in which there are quantifiers range
&gt; over properties (or set) of individuals (among other things),
&gt; third-order logic in which there are quantifiers that range over
&gt; properties of properties of individuals (among other things), 
&gt; and so on.
&gt; Omega-order logic has quantifiers that range over all the things that
&gt; all the nth-order logics range over, for all n.

MW: Um, but above we were agreeing that our quantifiers were going to range
over classes, but somehow that stays first order? I think you did something
clever to make this alright, but I certainly don't understand the ins and
outs
of it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e., roughly, there are in its intended semantics 
&gt; objects of every
&gt; &gt; &gt; finite order, and, in its language, variables that range over each
&gt; &gt; &gt; order),
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: You definitely lost me!
&gt; 
&gt; Does the above help?

MW: Yes thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (aside: did you hear about the baseball pitcher who 
&gt; complained to his
&gt; &gt; interviewer that the problem he had with the press was that they
&gt; &gt; printed what he said, not what he meant?)
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I hate it when that happens!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The untyped lambda calculus (developed in by Church and Kleene in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the 30s) is an approach to computability theory (though, notably,
&gt; &gt; &gt; has also been used more recently in the semantics of natural
&gt; &gt; &gt; language as the basis of a theory of properties and 
&gt; relations).  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; untyped calculus, while powerful and flexible, is also
&gt; &gt; &gt; mathematically very complex, and I haven't seen anything 
&gt; in ontology
&gt; &gt; &gt; that requires it.  Perhaps if you said what a 
&gt; "constraint" is.  Are
&gt; &gt; &gt; you simply talking about the ability to define a class or relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; by means of some condition like "x is red and x is an 
&gt; apple"?  That
&gt; &gt; &gt; only requires a reasonable class theory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: That's about it. I thought that using variables at all implied
&gt; &gt; Lambda Calculus.
&gt; 
&gt; Which, I take it, you now no longer think!

MW: Correct.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When I say something strange about logic, don't look
&gt; &gt; for anything complicated or deep when ignorance will provide an
&gt; &gt; adequate explanation.
&gt; 
&gt; *laugh*  Your humility is refreshing, especially in this forum!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; note: relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are only
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allowed when the nature of the constraint they define is defined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by a lambda expression.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Relations don't define anything; they are just (for you) sets of
&gt; &gt; &gt; ordered pairs.  And it is looking more and more like a 
&gt; constraint is
&gt; &gt; &gt; just a condition like the one above.  I think you should leave
&gt; &gt; &gt; "lambda" out of it!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: fine, (its all Greek to me!?) but what should I have said?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I'm not sure I understand what you were trying to say 
&gt; well enough.
&gt; Perhaps simply that all relations between classes have to be definable
&gt; by some first-order condition?

MW: You took the words right out of my mouth (if only!)

Thanks a lot for persevering here.
