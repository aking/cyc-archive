John,

Thanks very much for your analysis of Peirce CP 5:569 relative to
meaning-preserving translation. It seems that another relevant quote along
the same lines is:

"A sign stands for something to the idea which it produces, or modifies. Or,
it is a vehicle conveying into the mind something from without. That for
which it stands is called its object; that which it conveys, its meaning;
and the idea to which it gives rise, its interpretant. The object of
representation can be nothing but a representation of which the first
representation is the interpretant. But an endless series of
representations, each representing the one behind it, may be conceived to
have an absolute object at its limit. The meaning of a representation can be
nothing but a representation. In fact, it is nothing but the representation
itself conceived as stripped of irrelevant clothing. But this clothing never
can be completely stripped off; it is only changed for something more
diaphanous. So there is an infinite regression here. Finally, the
interpretant is nothing but another representation to which the torch of
truth is handed along; and as representation, it has its interpretant again.
Lo, another infinite series." CP 1:339

If I understand this approach correctly, then I do not doubt its validity,
yet I am bothered by the definition of "truth" in terms of translations of a
proposition between a potentially infinite set of different ways the
proposition could be stated in different languages.

I think that when we perceive a statement is true, our perception of truth
must be finite. At most it would seem that we could use some finite form of
meta-reasoning, or perhaps a finite form of induction, to deduce that a
proposition must be true in each of an infinite set of all possible
circumstances relevant to that proposition... This would seem a promising
approach toward finitizing the concept of truth in such cases...

Two other quotes, which I like better, from Peirce are:

"Deduction is that mode of reasoning which examines the state of things
asserted in the premisses, forms a diagram of that state of things,
perceives in the parts of that diagram relations not explicitly mentioned in
the premisses, satisfies itself by mental experiments upon the diagram that
these relations would always subsist, or at least would do so in a  certain
proportion of cases, and concludes their necessary, or probable, truth." -
CP 1:66

"Induction is that mode of reasoning which adopts a conclusion as
approximate, because it results from a method of inference which must
generally lead to the truth in the long run. For example, a ship enters port
laden with coffee. I go aboard and sample the coffee. Perhaps I do not
examine over a hundred beans, but they have been taken from the middle, top,
and bottom of bags in every part of the hold. I conclude by induction that
the whole cargo has approximately the same value per bean as the hundred
beans of my sample. All that induction can do is to ascertain the value of a
ratio." - CP 1:67

What I like about these quotes are the explicit references to "observation"
as a component of determining that a proposition is true...

Quite often we are concerned with the truth of propositions not in all
possible worlds, but only in certain contexts, and limited to certain times
and places. Thus when I say "it is raining", I am asserting a proposition to
be true in a very limited context, time and place. The truth of my
proposition depends on whether I and others who are observing the same
context, at the same time and place, would agree that the statement
correctly describes what is happening.

Granted, an unlimited number of different people could have different
interpretants (internal conceptual structures) all representing that it is
raining. Yet I do not need to reason about all the infinity of different
possible conceptual structures they may have. Rather, I need to somehow know
that my own perceptions tell me it is raining, and that I describe these
perceptions by the sign / phrase "it is raining", and I need to know that
most often whenever I say "it is raining", other people agree with me, and
that most often whenever other people say "it is raining", I agree with
them -- which seems to be a form of finite induction... Though how we all
learn to say "it is raining" in response to the same kinds of situations is
another, "Gavagai" problem...

Generally, it seems to me that a predicate is a sign representing a kind of
property, relationship, event, situation, etc., that may be asserted to
exist, and which may involve other referents.

A predication, or proposition (in general, I would use the terms
synonymously) would then be a "complex sign" involving the use of a
predicate along with signs representing one or more referents, to refer to
the existence of a property, relationship, event, situation, etc. involving
one or more referents.

Whether a predication is true or false then, in general, would depend upon
the observation of an agent, to verify whether the state of affairs claimed
by the proposition actually exists. A proposition is considered to be true
iff one observes that the referent (property, relationship, etc.) that it
refers to actually exists, within a certain context, space and time where
the proposition is being considered.

It would seem then that the "meaning" of a proposition is its referent, i.e.
it is whatever property, relationship, event, situation, etc. that the
proposition refers to. A proposition is meaningful iff its meaning exists,
i.e. iff the proposition is true according to the observation of some agent.

This approach seems close to that of a Russellian proposition, as described
by Robert C. Moore in "Logic and Representation", yet it also seems possible
to define in terms of Peircean semiotics...

Anyway, these are just some preliminary thoughts, and I would very much
appreciate your comments, and those of others, about them...

"Truth is the conformity of a representamen to its object, *its* object, ITS
object, mind you. The International Dictionary at the writer's elbow, the
Century Dictionary which he daily studies, the Standard which he would be
glad sometimes to consult, all contain the word yes; but that word is not
true simply because he is going to ask on this eighth of January 1906, in
Pike County, Pennsylvania, whether it is snowing. There must be an action of
the object upon the sign to render the latter true. Without that, the object
is not the representamen's object. [...] Here is a view of the writer's
house: what makes that house to be the object of the view? Surely not the
similarity of appearance. There are ten thousand others in the country just
like it. No, but the photographer set up the film in such a way that
according to the laws of optics, the film was forced to receive an image of
this house. What the sign virtually has to do in order to indicate its
object -- and make it its -- all it has to do is just to seize its
interpreter's eyes and forcibly turn them upon the object meant: it is what
a knock at the door does, or an alarm or other bell, or a whistle, a
cannon-shot, etc. It is pure physiological compulsion; nothing else. ..." CP

&gt; Subject: RE: Meaning-Preserving Translation (MPT)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Phil,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for bringing that quotation into the fray.  I believe
&gt; that I am using the word "proposition" in a way that is quite
&gt; consistent with Peirce's usage:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;"But even if it were impossible to distinguish between truth and reality,
&gt; &gt;that would not in the least prevent our defining what it is that truth
&gt; &gt;consists in. Truth and falsity are characters confined to
&gt; propositions.  A
&gt;
&gt; &gt;proposition is a sign which separately indicates its object.
&gt;
&gt; Peirce is explicitly saying that a proposition is a sign.
&gt; But CSP elsewhere drew a distinction between a sign instance,
&gt; such as an occurrence of the word "the", and a sign type, such
&gt; as the word "the" as the syntactic form of a sign.  Both of
&gt; them are, according to CSP, signs.
&gt;
&gt; For my definition of meaning-preserving translation (MPT),
&gt; I defined a proposition as an equivalence class of sentences.
&gt; Each sentence, as uttered, is a sign instance.  Each sentence
&gt; as a syntactic construct is a sign type.  My propositions are
&gt; a class of sign types in one or more languages.  That class
&gt; represents the supertype of all the sign types that have the
&gt; same interpretants in all those languages.  It too is a sign
&gt; type.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Thus, a
&gt; &gt;portrait with the name of the original below it is a
&gt; proposition. It asserts
&gt;
&gt; &gt;that if anybody looks at it, he can form a reasonably correct idea of how
&gt; &gt;the original looked.
&gt;
&gt; Note that a portrait by itself would not be a proposition
&gt; because there would be no indication of its object.  The
&gt; addition of the name plus the convention that a name below
&gt; a portrait indicates the name of the person portrayed adds
&gt; the necessary connection between the form (picture) and the
&gt; object (person).  That is why I require condition #3 of
&gt; vocabulary preserving in my definition of MPT.  Without
&gt; that condition, one could claim that the following three
&gt; sentences "express the same proposition":
&gt;
&gt;  1. "Every cat is a cat."
&gt;
&gt;  2. "Every dog is a dog."
&gt;
&gt;  3. "Every unicorn is a unicorn."
&gt;
&gt; All three of these sentences have the same logical form,
&gt; and all three would have the denotation true in every
&gt; possible world.  But their content words have different
&gt; referents (and "unicorn" has no referent in our world).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;A sign is only a sign in actu by virtue of its
&gt; &gt;receiving an interpretation, that is, by virtue of its
&gt; determining another
&gt;
&gt; &gt;sign of the same object. This is as true of mental judgments as it is of
&gt; &gt;external signs. To say that a proposition is true is to say that every
&gt; &gt;interpretation of it is true. Two propositions are equivalent when either
&gt; &gt;might have been an interpretant of the other.
&gt;
&gt; Exactly.  A proposition, as I defined it, is a supertype
&gt; of equivalent propositions as stated in multiple languages.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This equivalence, like others,
&gt; &gt;is by an act of abstraction (in the sense in which forming an
&gt; abstract noun
&gt;
&gt; &gt;is abstraction) conceived as identity. And we speak of believing in a
&gt; &gt;proposition, having in mind an entire collection of equivalent
&gt; propositions
&gt;
&gt; &gt;with their partial interpretants.
&gt;
&gt; I couldn't have said it better.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thus, two persons are said to have the
&gt; &gt;same proposition in mind. The interpretant of a proposition is itself a
&gt; &gt;proposition. Any necessary inference from a proposition is an
&gt; interpretant
&gt;
&gt; &gt;of it.
&gt;
&gt; Indeed.  That is condition #2 of proof preserving for an MPT.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; When we speak of truth and falsity, we refer to the possibility of
&gt; &gt;the proposition being refuted; and this refutation (roughly
&gt; speaking) takes
&gt;
&gt; &gt;place in but one way. Namely, an interpretant of the proposition
&gt; would, if
&gt;
&gt; &gt;believed, produce the expectation of a certain description of
&gt; percept on a
&gt;
&gt; &gt;certain occasion. The occasion arrives: the percept forced upon us is
&gt; &gt;different. This constitutes the falsity of every proposition of which the
&gt; &gt;disappointing prediction was the interpretant.	Thus, a
&gt; false proposition is
&gt;
&gt; &gt;a proposition of which some interpretant represents that, on an occasion
&gt; &gt;which it indicates, a percept will have a certain character, while the
&gt; &gt;immediate perceptual judgment on that occasion is that the
&gt; percept has not
&gt;
&gt; &gt;that character. A true proposition is a proposition belief in which would
&gt; &gt;never lead to such disappointment so long as the proposition is not
&gt; &gt;understood otherwise than it was intended." CP 5:569

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Okay, I will try to remember that you talk this way.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The way I see it, however, your translation of what you
&gt; &gt;&gt; describe as "Peirce's informal statement" into formal terms
&gt; &gt;&gt; is a translation that alters significant aspects of its meaning.
&gt;
&gt; What "significant aspects" do you claim I have altered?
&gt; Perhaps I should have been more precise in saying that
&gt; a proposition is "a supertypere" of all the sign types in
&gt; the equivalence class instead of saying that it "is" the
&gt; equivalence class.  But since a supertype of a type of s
&gt; is itself a type of s, a proposition is also a sign type.
&gt;
&gt; I'll revise my previous definition to say that a
&gt; proposition is the supertype of all the sentence types
&gt; in several different languages that are in the same
&gt; equivalence class, as determined by some MPT.
