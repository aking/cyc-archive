Arisbeans,

There is a subject that I keep putting off --
with quite a lot of encouragement to do so! --
but I really feel like I must broach it now,
in spite of my doing so breaking up the flow
and coming out of sequence in the overall course
of discourse that would be the more natural order
here, with respect to this "Living Organon" (LO!),
but it appears to me now that it cannot be avoided,
that is, for all of the following reasons, at least:

1.  I need to give this discussion "something to shoot for", as they say,
    some sense of an aim, an ending in futuro, a goal, a target, a telos,
    and one that appears to be worth going after, or out of one's way to
    arrive at -- notice how difficult it is to avoid, not to mention how
    unnatural it is to even try, to avoid the "split infinitive" and its
    just as evil twin, the "dangling preposition", here, in the very act
    of trying to hardly succeed at describing what it is I am after even.
    But I must continue, in spite of the syntactic adversities that this
    adopted language throws in my way, for there really is a pragma that
    is "worth the candle" of burning a little midnight, even midday, oil.

2.  I forgot the other reasons.  The effort of trying to make the
    first reason effable made me so tired that all of the reasons
    that I know I had in my mind have clean slipped away, effaced
    for the moment, that is, almost as if to say, for the sake of
    their eigen-momentum, perhaps, that I took from them to drive
    my initial essay into the very roster of reasons that enlists
    them, so self-sacrificingly, to this present cause of reasons.
    I have dubbed this phenomenon, for I have seen it happen many
    times before, the "Heisenberg Variations On The Tabula Rasa" --
    since it refers to a slate that only goes blank when you take
    the trouble to look at it -- does that remind you of anything
    or anybody or anyone that you know?  That's okay, I know that,
    if they were important, I will remember them in time, or so I
    hope, all in good time.  In any case, they may well have been
    sub-reasons of my initial reason, the first philosophy of the
    pragma that I gave, say, reasons why an aim is worth pursuing.

It is a good thing that I put the subject of this note in the subject line,
as the first thing that I did, or else I would have clean forgotten by now
what is was that I had ever been planning to talk about in the first place!

So, without further ado, and with a little bit of stored up yolk
of reconstituted encouragement from the voice of none other than
Rudolf Valentino -- don't ask me why, at a time like this I take
whatever encouragement I can get, no matter whatever the source! --
I will now make yet another attempt to re-introduce this subject
to which I have alluded before under some of the following names:
"Analytic Differential Ontology" (ADO), when we imagine it to be
a question of being itself, or the "Differential Extension" (DE)
of logic, for now, just the propositional or the sentential type
of logic, specifically, for my part, as expressed in what I call
a "Reflective Extension" (RE) of Peirce's Logical Graphs, in sum,
named "DiffLog" and "RefLog", respectively.  I will apologize at
this point for all of the "rude mnemonic mechanics", but I think
that you can probably guess by now that this is utterly the only
way that I have found to keep track of all this stuff in my head.

More, Later,

Jon Awbrey
