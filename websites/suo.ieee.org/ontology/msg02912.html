Jon,

That is indeed a laudable purpose:

&gt; My purpose here is develop the application of some formal techniques
&gt; that arise out of the pragmatic theory of sign relations and to use
&gt; them toward one specific end, that of constructing a web framework
&gt; in which intercommunicability and interoperability might actually
&gt; be feasible and not just something that people prattle on about,

Good!  But formal techniques are incredibly boring, even to formalists,
when the purpose and applications are shrouded in the mists.  In
order to communicate effectively with people who have problems,
you must show how your formalism can help solve their problems.

&gt; the way that they have always done about AI, until one of four
&gt; things up &amp; happen:  (1) they realize that "gee, this is hard",
&gt; and drop it, (2) they get tired of their own repetitiveness,
&gt; (3) they discredit themselves with the utter futility of
&gt; their attempts, (4) the mainstream does what it usually
&gt; does, and drowns them all in their sleep, with the able
&gt; assistance of not few off-mainstream contributaries.

People working in AI are very well aware of the difficulties.
Graeme Hirst expressed the general frustration in a pithy slogan:

  A year working on AI is enough to make you believe in God.

AI researchers would applaud any advance you make toward a solution.
But before they are willing to study your formalism, you must show
how it relates to their problems, as they state them.  If they
have not formulated their problem statements in a manner that you
consider appropriate, then you should start with their statement
exactly as they have stated it, and transform it systematically into
a form that is amenable to your approach.  And then show how your
formalism solves it.

My earlier recommendation still stands.  That is exactly what
I have been doing with all of my writings.  I don't serialize
my papers or books as email installments.  I put them on the
web, send a short note to announce them, and let people read
them or ignore them at their pleasure:

JS&gt;&gt;  1. Organize your notes on this topic into an article
&gt;&gt;     and contribute it as a paper on the SUO web server.
&gt;&gt;     Then send one note to all and sundry about that paper.	
 
JA&gt; Look, I am working the applications of these ideas in dialogue
fashion.
&gt; It may be in dialogue with somebody I was talking to last week, last year,
&gt; or 30 years ago, that I am just now working out an answer to, or somebody
&gt; in the future, but dialogue it is.

That is good.  But you can't have a dialog with people who are
so disgusted with your incessant emails that they automatically
push the delete or program their computer to do it for them.

JA&gt; I have already spent those 30 years
&gt; writing papers and reports that nobody will ever read.

Then perhaps you should take Mrs. Joyce's advice:  "James,
why don't you write books that people can understand?"

&gt; Any day now
&gt; I will chuck this whole hassle, go back and finish my dissertation,
&gt; wrap it up in black leather on some library shelf, and you can all
&gt; read about it in 120 years or so, if ever, the way that it's always
&gt; been done before.  And I will have learned what I am already beginning
&gt; to suspect, that all of thes folks running around telling us how this
&gt; brave new web is going to catalyze that process and give us new ways
&gt; of speaking and working togteher, presnet company not excluded --
&gt; well, I've heard that one before, too.

There is certainly a great deal that you have learned through your
years of inquiry.  And there is a great deal that many people who
subscribe to these mailing lists could learn from you.  But you
have to meet your audience at least part of the way.  You must
show how your work can help solve their problems.
 
&gt; This is new stuff, John.  The computational and extensional work-ups
&gt; of the sign-relational basis have been ignored by the philosophical
&gt; side of the Peirce community, and this whole field has lain fallow
&gt; since Peirce left it.

That is certainly true.  I believe that there is an enormous amount
of work to be done in building on Peirce's foundations.  But to show
how it is relevant to anybody's interests, you must show how it can
solve their problems.

&gt; I have this book.  It is a very nice, very gentle, very non-technical
&gt; popularization of a well-chosen sample of Peirce ideas.  Fine &amp; dandy.

I was not mentioning it for your enlightenment, but for the people
who might want to read a gentle, non-technical popularization.
Perhaps if they had such an intro, they might be more inclined
to read the sequel.

&gt; That has very little to do with what I am trying to do here on behalf
&gt; of the SUO effort, for the sake of developing the theory of signs, or
&gt; in pursuit of its yet untapped applications to problems of computation,
&gt; communications, and intelligent systems engineering.

That is why I have been saying that you need to show the SUO gang,
in terms that they can appreciate, how your work on their behelf
is going to help them.  And that means that you have to address
their problems directly, if you want them to pay attention.

&gt;  Aside from that,
&gt; you and I both know the history of pragmatic thinking:  the likes of
&gt; James, Dewey, Morris, and others, to various degrees and all with the
&gt; very best of intentions, afforded extremely convenient straw-targets
&gt; for the likes of Russell, Carnap, Quine, and others to set afire or
&gt; just plain ignore.

Yes, I keep telling people that they should read the master instead
of spending too much time on his disciples.  But most people don't
bother to read any of them.  And unless you can show how Peirce's
work and your extensions are relevant to them, they won't pay any
attention to your work either.

Bottom line:  Practice Part III, Rhetoric -- not in a way that
pleases yourself, but in a way that pleases your audience.

John Sowa
