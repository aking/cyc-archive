&gt; Matthew --
&gt; 
&gt; I think my point is pretty simple.   We have started labeling 
&gt; people as
&gt; "Endurantists" and "Perdurantists".  I won't be so labeled, 
&gt; and I believe
&gt; such labeling is counterproductive.  Am I being overly 
&gt; sensitive?  I sure
&gt; hope so!

MW: I think it only matters if the labels are:
a) used perjoratively, or
b) are innaccurate.

On the other hand, working out the particular viewpoints that people
have, perhaps based on a check list, is useful - bearing in mind 
that anyone can have more than one viewpoint.

I also think it is important to establish whether possible viewpoints 
are actually held by some people. I would hate to develop an ontology
that wasn't anyone's viewpoint.

&gt; Dear Doug,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry, I really don't get your point here.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am going on
&gt; &gt; record to say I
&gt; &gt; will resist any attempt to classify me in such a way, and 
&gt; will work to
&gt; &gt; maintain an inclusive rather than a fragmenting posture for
&gt; &gt; any product
&gt; &gt; that emerges from our collective efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; It is Chris who is precisely arguing that we should include 
&gt; and understand
&gt; the different viewpoints
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Chris --
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would like to make an observation here that just struck me
&gt; &gt; as a point of
&gt; &gt; discomfort.  I suppose it is an interesting and valid thing
&gt; &gt; to explore at
&gt; &gt; length the ontological architecture that you have articulated - both
&gt; &gt; earlier and in your revised Word document version over the
&gt; &gt; last several
&gt; &gt; days.  I have to admit that I don't really get the 
&gt; distinction that is
&gt; &gt; being labored so mightily between a 4-D world and a 3-D world
&gt; &gt; plus time.  I
&gt; &gt; say this having read your book very thoroughly, which you
&gt; &gt; were kind enough
&gt; &gt; to send me in electronic form.  I annotated it heavily, with
&gt; &gt; the intent of
&gt; &gt; pursuing a detailed conversation with you, because it seems 
&gt; to be very
&gt; &gt; fundamental in the minds of several people here, but I 
&gt; haven't had the
&gt; &gt; time, then or now to really engage at the level I would like.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The point of discomfort for me, though, goes beyond the
&gt; &gt; architecture, or
&gt; &gt; issues ontological relativism.  What concerns me is language
&gt; &gt; such as "I
&gt; &gt; hope you are not dismissing the difference between Endurantists and
&gt; &gt; Perdurantists".  This appears to go beyond the discussion of
&gt; &gt; concepts and
&gt; &gt; architectures into the realm of classifying people into
&gt; &gt; various camps based
&gt; &gt; on their understanding, use of, or comfort with, these 
&gt; concepts.  This
&gt; &gt; reification of concepts in the form of competing groups of 
&gt; people, and
&gt; &gt; labeling human beings in this way, will tend to create a
&gt; &gt; polarizing effect
&gt; &gt; that is antithetical to the work at hand.  By this I am not
&gt; &gt; simply whining
&gt; &gt; "Can't we all just please get along ...".  I am going on
&gt; &gt; record to say I
&gt; &gt; will resist any attempt to classify me in such a way, and 
&gt; will work to
&gt; &gt; maintain an inclusive rather than a fragmenting posture for
&gt; &gt; any product
&gt; &gt; that emerges from our collective efforts.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think we might be agreeing - at least in part.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was not arguing for one ontology being right - merely for
&gt; &gt; understanding
&gt; &gt; what choices one faces when trying to make a consistent 
&gt; 'collection of
&gt; &gt; signs'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I agree that there are different world views - which one can
&gt; &gt; characterize
&gt; &gt; as
&gt; &gt; collections of signs. It is probably true that some of the different
&gt; &gt; collections of signs are better for one purpose, and some for
&gt; &gt; others. And
&gt; &gt; that, in some sense, it is better to have a collection of 
&gt; collections.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, it seems to me that making a consistent 'collection
&gt; &gt; of signs' or
&gt; &gt; 'world-view' is difficult. So producing even one consistent
&gt; &gt; view would be
&gt; &gt; an
&gt; &gt; achievement. Also, that the process of producing the one 
&gt; view helps to
&gt; &gt; establish how each choice influences/constrains the others.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Other comments below: CP&gt;
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Chris,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Although I am a realist (in the sense that I believe that there
&gt; &gt; are fundamental laws of the universe, which science is slowly
&gt; &gt; approaching, but never quite capturing completely), I
&gt; &gt; also believe that any representation we use is at best an
&gt; &gt; approximation for a particular purpose.  My main point is that
&gt; &gt; I don't consider any representation to be absolutely correct.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; CP&gt; The ontological relativity is different from the
&gt; &gt; increasing accuracy of
&gt; &gt; empirical theories - as what distinguishes the different ontological
&gt; &gt; positions is not a matter for empirical observation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Of course, I if was going to be exact, I should have 
&gt; written - "In a
&gt; &gt; &gt;Perdurantist (Eternalist) Ontology ..." - but everyone seems
&gt; &gt; to have taken
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;4-D and 3-D as short-hand for this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't even like terms like perdurantist as qualifiers on the
&gt; &gt; ontology.  I consider them (like 3-D and 4-D) to be qualifiers
&gt; &gt; on a particular collection of signs that may be useful for one
&gt; &gt; purpose and not quite so useful for others.  I don't consider
&gt; &gt; either 3-D or 4-D to be "more fundamental" than the other.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; CP&gt; I do not remember arguing that one or other was more
&gt; &gt; fundamental (I am
&gt; &gt; not sure how one would measure fundamental) - however I do
&gt; &gt; believe (along
&gt; &gt; with Matthew and Pat) on the basis of experience, that the 4-D (or
&gt; &gt; Perdurantist) view has significant advantages for the
&gt; &gt; semantic integration
&gt; &gt; of commercial systems (e-commerce etc.). I also think that if
&gt; &gt; someone were
&gt; &gt; to document this view in detail, this would be a big step forward.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;the position is really about
&gt; &gt; &gt;the nature of change and time and - as you have pointed out
&gt; &gt; a number of
&gt; &gt; &gt;times - the closely related notion of cause.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I agree.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;However, I hope you are not dismissing the difference
&gt; &gt; between Endurantists
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;and Perdurantists as 'artifact[s] of
&gt; &gt; &gt;the notation'.
