&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I always take people at their word,
&gt; &gt; so I take you really to want to know:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The POV that you have been exposing here
&gt; &gt; cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
&gt; &gt; if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
&gt; &gt; information contained in their apt expressions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The "Pat Hayes Universal Change Of Variables Formula" (PHUCOVF)
&gt; &gt; has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula
&gt; &gt; that it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted
&gt; &gt; that nobody ever meant to say what some people once pretended
&gt; &gt; that it said, as have you also in regard to a co-indited point.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned Pat's proof,
&gt;      but I am not sufficiently versed in these things to be sure that
&gt;      you are not employing the same kinds of tricks that you claim Pat
&gt;      has employed.  So I'm afraid that is not an arguement that will
&gt;      convince me on its own.  If you wish to do that you will have
&gt;      to present a specific example of where the information in some
&gt;      triadic relation cannot be transformed into some set of binary
&gt;      relations.  If you provide the triadic relation, I will provide
&gt;      the binary relations from which the triadic relation can be
&gt;      constructed (or not and admit you are right).

Dear Matthew,

We are all learning as we go, some of us one set of things, others another,
but I think that Pat and I have finally settled down to the purely logical --
in contradistinction to the "puerly rhetorical" (sic) -- facet of the task,
and I am secure in the knowledge that both of us are dogged enough not to
let it go until we flesh out some general satisfaction on this particular
bone of contention.  'On jugera', as Evariste Galois said.

Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
any rational sense will come of arguing about any puported form of
"analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
"reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.  As an object example,
taken for the moment in the converse direction of synthesis, joining
an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already an element of a 3-adic
relation, just as every other "binary operation" is a 3-adic relation.

Now, there are good reasons for proceeding further, that is,
once the omnipresence of 3-adic relations in every analytic
project is conceded, but perhaps it would be best for me to
halt at this point and see if we have any form of agreement
about this much, at least.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; &gt; The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the
&gt; &gt; circumstance that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
&gt; &gt; from an element of one.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
&gt;      of what a relation is to me.  This would easily explain how we
&gt;      have been missing each other.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I will take up the task of that refinement at my next opportunity.
