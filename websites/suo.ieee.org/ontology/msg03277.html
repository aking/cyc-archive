| Where number is irrelevant, regimented mathematical technique
| has hitherto tended to be lacking.  Thus it is that the progress

| measurable quantity of one sort or another.  Measurement consists
| in correlating our subject matter with the series of real numbers;
| and such correlations are desirable because, once they are set up,
| all the well-worked theory of numerical mathematics lies ready at
| hand as a tool for our further reasoning.  But no science can rest
| entirely on measurement, and many scientific investigations are
| quite out of reach of that device.  To the scientist longing for
| non-quantitative techniques, then, mathematical logic brings hope.
| It provides explicit techniques for manipulating the most basic
| ingredients of discourse.  Its yield for science may be expected to
| consist also in a contribution of rigor and clarity -- a sharpening of
| the concepts of science.  Such sharpening of concepts should serve both
| to disclose hitherto hidden consequences of given scientific hypotheses,
| and to obviate subtle errors which may stand in the way of scientific
| progress.

Jon Awbrey wrote (JA):

JC: By predicative I mean the standard usage that all of the defined terms
    can be isolated on the right hand side, and are in principle eliminable.

JA: So you order things like so -- Definiens (Defining) = Definiendum (Defined) --?

JA: I must confess to being of two minds about this issue.
    One part of my brain, washed in the cool, clear, fresh
    water ponds that are filled by that fountation of Lethe
    that we call Mathematics, is oblivious to the idea that
    there is any other kind of definition, as all recursions
    are supposed to be eliminable by Beth's theorem, that is,
    if I remember or ever got it right, but still, I do hold
    out hope that I might someday discover the fountation of
    &quot;synthetic a priori&quot; (SAP) knowledge -- so there you have
    my confession of heresy.  I would not even think of asking
    another to echo that dangerous sentiment, but let me ask:
    To what do you oppose this distinction of &quot;predicative&quot;?
    Is it only &quot;impredicative&quot; or something more synthetic?

JC: Impredicative definitions are at the root of all axiomatic
    theories that have more than one non-redundant defined term.
    Hilbert called this sort of thing implicit definition, and
    believed that all such should be eliminated in terms of
    explicit definitions.  Russell and Poincare both thought
    that explicit definitions were preferable, but were unclear
    whether or not they were eliminable.  Russell thought that
    the only non-eliminable definitions were in logic (this is
    the basic tenet of logicism).  The book I mentioned by Sher
    shows very nicely how there is a clear sense in which the
    goals of logicism have been largely achieved, and another
    sense in which they have not.

I am having trouble keeping my feet on the ground here.
The stuff that you mention below is pretty stratospheric,
and my aims are rather more plodding than that.  But it's
the only way that I have found to move forward in creating
the kind of software that we are going to be needing more
and more as time goes on, qualitative reasoning tools that
really, really work, that interface nicely with all the
sorts of quantitative decision making tools already in
place, organa that will be made of the right stuff,
of the sort that Quine dreamed on 50 years ago.

I took up Propositional Calculus or ZOL as a base camp for exploring the various
interrelated dimensions of syntax, semantics, semiotics, pragmatics, hermeneutics,
and so on, to the extent that they arise in a simple, but none-too-trivial species
of sign relations.  I will probably have to stick to that modest plan for a while.

One of the chief reasons for working within a sign relational paradigm
is so that one can at least talk in a sensible way about the relations
of signs to signs in ways that have further relations to objects that
are not in general signs.  These objects are elements or elephants
that exist in some platonic or pachydermic reality, respectively,
and that is where the rational rubber meets the empirical road.
If one considers mathematics to be a (quasi)empirical science,
and keeps a decent respect for the magnificats of the cosmos,
then one hardly needs to be told that finite formalizations
are limited in what they can capture of that glory, so the
need for GIT is restricted to those who delude themselves
otherwise on any one of those several scores of conceit.

JC: Various attempts to deal with this, e.g., by Craig and Ramsey,
    have not been found successful for empirical theories, which are
    the only ones I have studied closely.  &quot;Ramsification&quot; involves,
    basically, the elimination of all second order concepts (like identity,
    set, and others) in favour of one concept.  It is similar to this respect
    to Boolos &quot;erasure&quot; technique for showing the satisfiability of a 2nd order
    open formula.

JC: I use the Axiom of Choice quite freely, myself, though it is independent of the other
    set theoretic axioms.  I think it has intuitive appeal, and that it disadvantages are
    much smaller than its advantages.  I use it, though, only in cases in which a demon like
    Boolos &quot;Zeus&quot; demon (see Boolos and Jefferey, any edition) could justify its use though
    Zeus enumeration.  I think this has the proper sort of synthetic justification for us,
    but many, of course, would not agree, thinking as they do that logic is in the image of
    humans.  This latter idea leads to the issues I mentioned concerning the indeterminacy
    of some deterministic chaotic systems (Kellert), which is the relevance to this group,
    and why I am putting up with this overall digression, along with the significance of
    ideas of mathematical models to empirical modelling.

JC: So, I feel quite comfortable using impredicative definitions,
    and also with justifying them synthetically.  I would hope
    to be clear when I am doing that, though.

JC: By content, I mean, minimally, the capture of a collection of concrete
    (i.e. non-abstract) instances that are picked out by the concept whose
    content is under study.

JA: So then, you more contented with a definition of this sort,
    that proposes to define &quot;content&quot; in terms of itself?

JC: Yeh.  I gave my reasons some time ago for thinking that
    truth and its cognates cannot be explicitly defined.

Okay, if we are talking empirically now, then that appears to be clear.
Still there is, if not exactly a definition, then at least some hope of
a guideline to be found in the pragmatic maxim, which leads on to truth
as the end of inquiry, if truth is accessible to creatures of our sort.

JC: A set of WFFs (an abstraction of abstractions) is inconsistent if and 
    only if they are necessarily false, i.e., there is no way to assign 
    contents (give an interpretation) such the every member of the set comes 
    out true.  To make this non-abstract, a collection of conditions must be 
    defined that are real possibilities, and they must be capable of being 
    true together, and they can serve as an interpretation of the WFFs.  If 
    there is nothing that fits the bill, then either all of the WFFs have no 
    such interpretation, or at least some do, and the conjunction of these has 
    no interpretation.

JA: Can you give me a source, other than yourself, for this definition of inconsistency?

JC: From my notes of years ago?  The definition is used implicitly in W.F. Demopoulos'
    discussion of Frege's Julias Caesar problem (why is the sequence of Caesars not a
    sequence of numbers), in which he proposes a definition of number adequate not just
    for abstract number theory but for use in everyday life.  The article is in the
    journal Nous about five years ago or so.

JC: Corollaries:  Nothing is inconsistent unless it has no content in this sense.
    If something has no content in this sense, then either some non-redundant
    component is meaningless, or else it is inconsistent.

I do not get this.  A contradiction like &quot;q = ~q&quot; is not meaningless, it's just false,
at least, when it's interpreted in the classical and standard sort of logical setting.
An initial like &quot;q = q&quot; is not a sentence whose violation cannot be imagined or even
conceived, as Spencer Brown showed, but is simply a conventional starting point for
a certain style of formal system.

JC: A few other points: q is true in A entails A |= q, and vice versa, and 
    A satisfies q.  With Tarski's definition of truth, A satisfies q entails
    that A |= q, and thus q is true in A.

JC: A is inconsistent entails that A satisfies nothing and that nothing
    satisfies A.  None the less, if A is inconsistent, for all q, A |-- q.
    Hence, another good definition of inconsistent would be A is inconsistent
    if and only if, for all q, A |-- q, but it is not the case that A |= q.
    I call such cases semantically defective.  The liar paradoxes are primary
    cases, but there are lots of others.  This is why I say that inconsistency
    is fundamentally a semantic notion (though this is obscured in many approaches
    to logic).

JC: Furthermore, the various paradoxes arise because of a
    predilection to assume that all WFFs have interpretations,
    or content.  This is not always true, as the above definition
    makes immediately apparent.  We can discover that something
    we thought to be meaningful is not meaningful.

JA: I agree that it is important to note that not all signs denote.
    However, my analysis of the Liar suggests to me that it is simply
    a matter of assuming a false statement, from which anything follows.

JC: I am not convinced that the logic used in the argument is modern logic in
    which this is the case.  I prefer to deal with the specific presupposition of
    the argument being cogent.  If it is rejected, the argument is unsound, since
    it depends on an implicit false premise.  Requiring concrete interpretations
    in each case gives a scheme for telling when something abstract has an
    interpretation and when it doesn't.

JC: Jon, I'm finding this really stimulating, and you've sucked me in again,
    but it isn't really the stimulation I need right now.  Please don't be
    offended if I have to cut it off in order to do such mundane things
    as make money.

Yes, the virtual forces of career-path-dependent inertias are weighing most heavily on me too.
