Doug,

I agree with this position:

&gt;The interesting direction I'd like to move is to position the role of
&gt;ontology, and ontology languages.  It seems to me that the sweet spot for
&gt;ontology is not so  much in compiled instructions to computers, but rather

&gt;in reduced ambiguity in the content that is stored, retrieved, and
&gt;manipulated by computers.  This is why I've said that I think of ontologies

&gt;as playing a utility role as reference applications that help mediate among

&gt;other applications.  (Even as I'm saying this, I think about one of my
&gt;colleagues who insists that every application is itself a language!)

But I would like to clarify the following point:

&gt;So,
&gt;in addition to the distinction between human languages and computer
&gt;languages, we clearly need distinctions among various kinds of languages
&gt;used by and on computers (programming, application, ontology - as a weak
&gt;starter set).

I would say that the ultimate source of ambiguity (i.e., lexical
ambiguity, AKA polysemy) is the same for all fields of
endeavor, including every branch of science and everyday life:
namely, the inevitable mismatch between the discrete vocabulary
of any language (or semiotic system) and the continuously
variable, open-ended, potentially infinite range of phenomena,
purposes, and modes of behavior that people want to describe.

To use Wittgenstein's example, the same vocabulary is used and
reused in an open-ended number of language games.  A particular
computer language is a highly specialized language game in
which all the terms are used according to fixed rules.  But
those same terms can be used and reused in other language games
with slightly different rules -- e.g. FORTRAN vs. C vs. Java.

In conclusion, I would say that the ontology has to develop
two different, but related kinds of catalogs:

 1. A catalog of all the terms that are used in various
    fields.  There are many such examples already in existence,
    but they have to be collated and cross-referenced.

 2. A catalog of all the language games that use those terms.
    Each language game would be specified by formal axioms
    in a version of logic, such as KIF, SUO-CE, CGs, etc.
    These are the "theories" that we have been talking about
    in various formal discussions on this list.

There would also have to be indexes and cross references to
enable anyone to find all the language games (i.e., theories)
in which a particular term is used and all the terms that may
be used with any particular theory.
