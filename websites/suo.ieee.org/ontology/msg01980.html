&gt; &gt; Mark,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's a good example.  It does indeed show that
&gt; &gt; I must add another condition to the definition of
&gt; &gt; what it means to be "proof preserving":
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If a sentence s in language L1
&gt; &gt; is provable from some set A of
&gt; &gt; sentences in L1 (written A|-s)
&gt; &gt; and all sentences s and A can
&gt; &gt; be translated to language L2
&gt; &gt; by a meaning-preserving translation f,
&gt; &gt; then f(s) must be provable in L2 from
&gt; &gt; the translation f(A) of all sentences in A.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The following example wouldn't satisfy this condition:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Let L1 = English (or a formalized subset thereof in order to apply (2))
&gt; &gt; &gt; Let L2 = English (or same formalized subset ...)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Let the transformation be the identity transformation except that 'left'
&gt; &gt; &gt; in L1 maps to 'right' in L2, and 'right' in L1 maps to 'left' in L2.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just interchanging those two words would not satisfy all the
&gt; &gt; implications.  You would also have to reverse every possible
&gt; &gt; word or expression that might be used in any statement that
&gt; &gt; in any way involves the corresponding concepts.  For example,
&gt; &gt; consider the following three statements:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    - A solution of glucose in water rotates the plane of
&gt; &gt;      polarized light to the right.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    - A solution of fructose in water rotates the plane of
&gt; &gt;      polarized light to the left.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    - Fructose is sweeter than glucose.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you switched the words "right" and "left", you would also
&gt; &gt; have to modify in some way every other word that might be
&gt; &gt; influenced by the switch.  And note that you couldn't just
&gt; &gt; switch the terms "glucose" and "fructose" without also
&gt; &gt; modifying other implications, such as sweetness.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course, it is possible that there might be a true
&gt; &gt; looking-glass world, such as the one that Alice visited,
&gt; &gt; in which all the implications of all the related words are
&gt; &gt; modified appropriately.  But then, it would be reasonable
&gt; &gt; to say that switching the translations of f("right") and
&gt; &gt; f("left") would be appropriate for that world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thinking about what happens not so rarely when translating into
&gt; &gt; &gt; English a sentence that was translated into French from English
&gt; &gt; &gt; (or any other pair of natural languages), it seems to me that
&gt; &gt; &gt; one can preserve meaning and yet have t3 not be a single term,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but an expression involving multiple terms that might be provably
&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalent to t1, but neither vocabulary preserving, even taking
&gt; &gt; &gt; into account synonyms, nor structure preserving.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, I said "term" instead of "word" to include multi-word terms
&gt; &gt; in any particular language.  But when you go from L1 to L2, there
&gt; &gt; might be major transformations, such as the modifications that occur
&gt; &gt; when you go from CGs to KIF or to controlled natural languages.  But
&gt; &gt; those changes do not violate the condition I called "structure preserving",
&gt; &gt; which only involves the nesting of negations and quantifiers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For example, consider the translation of "A cat on a mat"
&gt; &gt; from CGs to KIF:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    [Cat]-&gt;(On)-&gt;[Mat]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; becomes
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    (exists (?x ?y)
&gt; &gt;        (and (cat ?x) (mat ?y) (on ?x ?y)))
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In one sense, the structure of KIF and CGs looks very different,
&gt; &gt; but in the sense I defined (which only considers quantifiers
&gt; &gt; and negations) the structure has not changed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; To use Jon's terminology, shoudn't &lt;o,s,i&gt; appear somewhere?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wanted to avoid any reference to the actual objects in
&gt; &gt; the universe of discourse because I wanted to define the
&gt; &gt; conditions on the translations in purely syntactic terms.
&gt; &gt; That restriction makes the conditions easy to check by
&gt; &gt; an efficiently computable algorithm.

&gt; 
&gt; John, Mark, ...
&gt; 
&gt; I have spent my idle hours the last couple of days
&gt; trying to come up with terminological work-arounds
&gt; for this general subject area, as I think that it
&gt; will deserve a diverse development with extended
&gt; ramifications.  Not much dust has settled yet,
&gt; but John's remarks in this note would appear
&gt; to help me reduce the problem quite a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; Just to acquaint you with my extremely tentative thoughts so far:
&gt; 
&gt; I had decided, most graciously, I thought, to permit
&gt; the words "meaning" and "proposition" to go on being
&gt; used in all of those ambiguous and equivocal manners
&gt; that appear to be their eternal lot among humankind,
&gt; for my part resorting, if need be, to these tactics:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  A panoply of devices like "Meaning:Con" and Meaning:Den" for the
&gt;     connotative meanings and the denotative meanings, respectively --
&gt;     where "connotative" means:den any meaning that is not denotative.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  A motley array of hedge-guards like "Prop:Obj" and "Prop:Sig" for the
&gt;     proposition as an abstract object and the proposition as a concrete sign,
&gt;     respectively.
&gt; 
&gt; This last punctillo spun me into an extended reflection, so far inconclusive,
&gt; on whether, in speaking of "abstract object" and "concrete sign", I had not
&gt; created a confound between the dimension marked by "abstract" and "concrete",
&gt; which seems to be very nearly continuous, and the dimension marked by the
&gt; terms "object" and "sign", which seems to be, in contrast, discrete.
&gt; Well, to make a short story incomplete, I will not divert you any
&gt; further with my other thoughts on these topics until such time as
&gt; they arrive at some point, or at least the sense of an ending.
&gt; 
&gt; However, John's clarifications here allow me, perhaps,
&gt; subject to approval, of course, to resolve the issue
&gt; rather more quickly, by redubbing what I am after
&gt; as "object preserving transformations" (OPT's),
&gt; and so that is what I will opt for next.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Regards,
&gt;

&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; Please note that neither "meaning" nor "proposition" is used
&gt; in the definitions.  The purpose of the formalism is to give
&gt; some meaning to the word "meaning" and to give a formal
&gt; definition for the word "proposition".
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I had decided, most graciously, I thought, to permit
&gt; &gt; the words "meaning" and "proposition" to go on being
&gt; &gt; used in all of those ambiguous and equivocal manners
&gt; &gt; that appear to be their eternal lot among humankind,
&gt; &gt; for my part resorting, if need be, to these tactics:
&gt; 
&gt; There is nothing ambiguous or equivocal about the word "proposition"
&gt; as I defined it, and the word "meaning" appears only as the name of
&gt; a particular kind of semiotic morphism, which I have called
&gt; a "meaning-preserving translation".

Yes, the old "What is a computer that he or she or it
may know a cardinal equivalence class?" personeuver,
but there was no j'accuse here, not of necessity.
I mentioned the ambivalence of the words as used
across the general population of humankind, and
you are not being held to account for the whole
lot of humankind, whatever truly may be your
share in the hope of it.

But this does serve to raise the very interesting question:
Is one interpreter's object and interpretant of a given sign
necessarily every interpreter's object and interpretant of it?

Just by way of bringing this back within my current limited scope --
for all of my advisors advise that I simply 'must' learn to focus --
let me stick to the sorts of signs that I call "Proposition Signs",
and that you call "sentences", at least, some of the time, along
with the sorts of objects that I call "Proposition Objects" and
that you call "propositions", defining them as a specified type
of equivalence classes of sentences.

Then, just in order to focus on a concrete example, let us return
to Leibniz's "Pre-Emanate Theorem" (PET), and let us take this as
our tack:

1.  To examine the Prop Signs of this PET that arise in a couple
    of different "calculi of propositional expressions" (COPE's).

2.  To consider these Prop Signs in relation to the various sorts
    of constructs and entities that might be taken, in one species
    of interpretation, model, representation, or another, as their
    Prop Objects.

Well, it's Michigan State versus Arizona time --
so I will have to break, and pick up again later.

&gt; &gt; and so that is what I will opt for next.
&gt; 
&gt; You can think of an MPT as a semiotic morphism f that
&gt; maps a sign s1 in language L1 to a sign s2 in language L2
&gt; while preserving the interpretant i and the object o.

Yes, but does the set of MPT's that you admit include all
of the transformations from s1 to s2 that preserve i &amp; o?

&gt; The translation f maps the "meaning triangle" &lt;s1, i, o&gt;
&gt; to another meaning triangle &lt;s2, i, o&gt; where s2 = f(s1).
&gt; In that sense, f preserves both the interpretant and
&gt; the object while translating the sign from L1 to L2.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, an MPT is both an object-preserving translation (OPT)
&gt; and an interpretant-preserving translation (IPT).  It replaces the
&gt; sign of the triad while leaving the other two corners unchanged.
