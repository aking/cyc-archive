Aldo,

All perception depends on inference.  But the chain of inference
may be shorter and more reliable for some entities than others.
 
&gt;John, either you think that intentions can only be inferred and do
&gt;not pertain to ontology, or you think that ontology considers only
&gt;some shared intentions and neutralizes contexts. But you can hardly
&gt;claim context dependency together with intention elimination.

You have stated three alternatives, none of which I implied
or intended.  That shows how fallible human perception and
inference of intention can be.  For the record,

 1. We may be aware of our own intentions more directly than
    those of other people, but as psychiatrists are fond of
    showing, we are often mistaken about our own intentions.
    Nonetheless, the existence of intentions is undeniable.

 2, The notion of "shared intention" would require multiple
    inferences to determine each intention and further inferences
    to compare them.  And each step of inference adds more
    uncertainties.  I don't know what you mean by "neutralize"
    context; it is omnipresent.  A "neutral" context, if it
    were ever achievable, would be highly artificial.

 3. I never said that I wanted to eliminate intentions.  I was
    merely observing that they are not observable in the data.
    We can observe what people say and do, but we can only infer
    their intentions, often by very indirect and fallible means.

&gt;Lexical meaning and sentential meaning are different matters. 
&gt;Sentential meaning is much more context-dependent, but depends on
&gt;the lexical meaning of the items the sentence is composed of.

The context dependencies of the sentence and its words cannot
be resolved independently of one another.  They depend on which
language game you are playing, as Ludwig W. would say.

&gt;On the other hand, the main relevance of context for sentential 
&gt;meaning is not that involved in your example, but rather the possible 
&gt;connotations given by the speakers in a certain situation (e.g., the 
&gt;affective value of that lamb for Mary, the fact that Mary haven't 
&gt;ever eaten lamb until some rice was put within, the strange calm with 
&gt;which Mary gave birth to the lamb, etc.).
&gt;In your example - apart connotations - the role of context is in 
&gt;disambiguating the lexical meaning of 'have', one of the most 
&gt;polysemous verbs in English (WordNet gives 21 entries).

Actually, I believe that Ruhl makes a strong case for monosemy
(_On Monosemy_ by Charles Ruhl, SUNY Press, Albany, 1989).
His point is that most, if not all words have a central core
meaning and the many meanings listed in a lexicon can be derived
by the techniques of metaphor, metonymy, and specialization of
the central core to a subtype that is appropriate for the language
game that is being played in the current context.

The so-called polysemy of "have" (or "echein") was noted by
Aristotle, but the core meaning of "have" is that the subject
stands in a certain kind of dyadic relation to the object.
In my KR book, I identified that relation with what Whitehead
called a "prehension".  The kind of prehension can be determined
from the language game, which is part of the context.

&gt;You could use a WordNet-based ontology library including a definition 
&gt;(more probably, an axiomatic description) of 11 shared average 
&gt;conceptualizations of 'little', 4 'of 'lamb',  21 of 'have', some of 
&gt;&lt;past tense&gt;, some of 'a' (indefinite article). That is all for 
&gt;ontology. If you want to analyze sentential meaning, you have to 
&gt;exploit ontologies, but they only provide a network of lexical 
&gt;meanings. Then you need a parser, a co-occurrence analyzer, an 
&gt;abductive inferential engine to check the possible representations of 
&gt;the sentential meaning compared to the topic of the text, etc.

To make dictionaries, lexicographers either steal the definitions
from other dictionaries or collect large number of citations,
group them by some inferred commonality, and make up definitions
that explain the commonality.  The number of definitions listed
depends on how thorough the lexicographers were in searching for
citations (or definitions to steal) and in how clever they were
in finding and explaining the commonalities.

By the way, C. S. Peirce was one of the few philosophers who
actually wrote and edited definitions for a major dictionary.
He served as an associate editor for the Century Dictionary,
for which he wrote, edited, or revised over 16,000 definitions.
Since the copyright expired long ago, most of the dictionaries
published in the 20th century include large numbers of
definitions stolen from the Century Dictionary.

&gt;&gt;I don't believe that intentions are dangerous or disturbing,
&gt;&gt;and I certainly don't believe that they should be neutralized.
&gt;&gt;I don't believe that anyone (human or machine) can ever know
&gt;&gt;someone else's intentions exactly, but I do believe that both
&gt;&gt;humans and machines can infer a great deal about them from
&gt;&gt;context (although humans are certainly better at it than
&gt;&gt;most current computer systems).
&gt;
&gt;Yes, but part of this job is not ontological.

I don't have much sympathy with turf wars about which academic
specialty has claimed ownership of a particular job.  That is
why I called my book _Knowledge Representation_, which is a
much broader term than "logic", "ontology", or "AI".  I also
believe that it is more in the spirit of one of my philosophical
heroes, Aristotle, who tried to encompass the full range of
human knowledge (cf. the opening of the book that his
editors called "Metaphysics").

&gt;Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations is one of my
&gt;Bildungsroman :-)

That should be required reading for anyone who is doing ontology,
semantics of natural language, or knowledge representation in
general.  And by the way, in the preface to that book, W. comments
on his earlier "mistakes" in the _Tractatus_:

  I was helped to realize these mistakes -- to a degree which I
  myself am hardly able to estimate -- by the criticism which my
  ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I discussed them in
  innumerable conversations during the last two years of his life. 

For a study of the historical connections between Peirce, Ramsey,
and Wittgenstein, I recommend
