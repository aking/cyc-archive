Hi John,

	Thanks for your comments.  I've tried to reply to the ones that
relate to the Merged Ontology.

&gt; 
&gt; Ian, Pat C., et al.,
&gt; 
&gt; Some comments:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Entity
&gt; &gt;&gt;         Physical
&gt; &gt;&gt;                 Object
&gt; &gt;&gt;                 Process
&gt; &gt;&gt;         Relation
&gt; &gt;&gt;         Abstract
&gt; &gt;&gt;                 Set
&gt; &gt;&gt;                 Proposition
&gt; &gt;&gt;                 Quantity
&gt; &gt;&gt;                 Attribute
&gt; 
&gt; Why do you have a 3-way split of Physical, Relation, &amp; Abstract?
&gt; 
&gt; Another question:  Why do you have an object/process distinction
&gt; under Physical and no parallel distinction under Abstract?
&gt; The parallel distinction that I put under abstract is the
&gt; Schema/Procedure distinction.  Those are the abstract descriptions
&gt; of objects and processes respectively.

The reason that I don't have anything like an object/process distinction
under Abstract is that, as I see it, this distinction is, however you cash
it out exactly, predicated on temporal attributes - an object, unlike a
process, persists through time, in some sense.  Since instances of Abstract,
by definition, do not have space-time locations, I didn't see how the
Schema/Procedure distinction could be retained.  This was based on a
criticism that Pat Hayes advanced a couple of months back, but I'd be very
interested in hearing your response to it.

&gt; 
&gt; Third question:  Why do you have set, quantity, proposition,
&gt; and attribute at the same level?  There is a great deal of
&gt; analysis that has to be done to distinguish them.  And most of
&gt; that analysis belongs to the general field of "formal semiotic",
&gt; which also includes logic as a subset.
&gt; 
&gt; I would suggest a two-way split of Physical &amp; Abstract, with
&gt; physical relationships under physical and abstract relation
&gt; types under Abstract.

I'm not sure what you mean by a physical relationship.  Even if a
relationship mediates physical objects, I guess I would be more inclined to
lump it with Abstract than with Physical.  How about this compromise?  We
could move the whole Relation subtree and position it under the class Set.
This would make Relation a lower level distinction, and it would make
Relation inherit ultimately from Abstract.

&gt; 
&gt; PC&gt;I have mentioned previously that the creation of an "abstract"
&gt; &gt;category
&gt; &gt;as disjoint from "physical" at the highest level is in my view
&gt; &gt;unnecessry 
&gt; &gt;and highly undesirable, since it would preclude, for example, the
&gt; &gt;creation 
&gt; &gt;of a general concept "object" which subsumes both physical 
&gt; objects and 
&gt; &gt;abstract objects.
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, there is a general type Entity, which subsumes
&gt; both physical and abstract.  Second, I would place the
&gt; Physical/Abstract distinction on the same level as many other
&gt; top-level distinctions.  There is no reason why Physical/Abstract
&gt; should be considered more fundamental than several other
&gt; distinctions that might be placed at the top level.
&gt; 
&gt; PC&gt;There are other problems, such as if one wants to
&gt; &gt;define
&gt; &gt;a space or time as a set (or at least as a collection), it would be
&gt; &gt;impossible 
&gt; 
&gt; Space and time are not sets or collections.  Sets and
&gt; collections are representations.  Nothing physical can be
&gt; a representation, although it might be used to record a sign
&gt; of some representation (as a pencil mark may be used to
&gt; make signs that represent sets or collections or numbers).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;in the above classification to consider either as a 
&gt; "physical" concept,
&gt; &gt;even 
&gt; &gt;though space-time is as physical as my hand, as I understand current
&gt; &gt;theories
&gt; &gt;of cosmology.  One tactic is used by CYC, for example, where 
&gt; the concept
&gt; &gt;of
&gt; &gt;"set or collection" is at a very high level, allowing one to treat
&gt; &gt;groups of
&gt; &gt;physical objects to some extent like sets, but also allowing purely 
&gt; &gt;mathematical sets to be defined.
&gt; 
&gt; That is one reason why Lenat says that the upper level of
&gt; the Cyc ontology is not very important.  It is so totally
&gt; screwed up that there are no useful inferences that can be
&gt; derived from it.
&gt; 
&gt; PC&gt;The main motivating factor in my concern about a high-level
&gt; &gt;abstract/concrete
&gt; &gt;distinction is that this would nullify the common and very useful
&gt; &gt;process of 
&gt; &gt;creating more general ("abstract") concepts by removing spcific
&gt; &gt;attributes
&gt; &gt;or specific defining axioms from lower-level concepts.  It should be
&gt; &gt;possible
&gt; &gt;to remove the physical attributes from physical objects and 
&gt; processes to
&gt; &gt;get
&gt; &gt;more general concepts that are not physical, but are ancestors to the
&gt; &gt;physical concepts.
&gt; 
&gt; A general physical concept can only become abstract by removing
&gt; all physicality from it.  Generality and Abstraction are totally
&gt; orthogonal distinctions.
&gt; 
&gt; PC&gt;An outline of an alternative top few levels could be, just for
&gt; &gt;illustation
&gt; &gt;(concepts with a preceding ** have multiple inheritance in this short
&gt; &gt;classification):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Entity
&gt; &gt;    Object
&gt; &gt;       Physical Object
&gt; &gt;           Ordinary Matter

&gt; &gt;               Artefact
&gt; &gt;       Mental Object

&gt; &gt;        Semantic Relation
&gt; &gt;    Property (=attribute)

&gt; &gt;           Time

&gt; &gt;            Abstract space
&gt; &gt;            Physical space-time
&gt; &gt;    State
&gt; &gt;        Physical State
&gt; 
&gt; No.  There is too much here to criticize.  It would be better
&gt; if you suggested your distinctions one at a time, since every
&gt; one of them deserves a distinct thread that could take several
&gt; hundred e-mails to discuss.
&gt; 
&gt; PC&gt;Much of importance has been left out, and there are other concepts
&gt; &gt;in most of these categories that have been left out, this is 
&gt; &gt;just presented as an illustration of why high-level "abstract" is
&gt; &gt;unnecessarily constraining.  It is particularly a problem where
&gt; &gt;we hope that the SUO will be useful as a common basis for as many
&gt; &gt;lower-level ontologies as can fit into any one "ontological 
&gt; commitment".
&gt; &gt;The illustrative hierarchy here is not the only one that could be
&gt; &gt;created without an abstract/physical dichotomy, and many others might
&gt; &gt;be justs as useful or more useful.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I don't think so.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The justification of these choices and axiomatization to reflect 
&gt; &gt;the meaningful relations will require more time than I can provide in
&gt; &gt;the immediate future, but I believe that this classification is 
&gt; &gt;consistent and will be more useful than one with a highest-level
&gt; &gt;abstract/physical dichotomy.
&gt; 
&gt; As I said before, the abstract/physical dichotomy is only one
&gt; of many distinctions that could be applied at the top level.
