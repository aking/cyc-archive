Concerning the suggestions on procedure:

"Schoening, James R CECOM DCSC4I" wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt;         Since we may have some votes coming up, let's see if we agree on how
&gt; Robert's Rules of Order should apply to email votes.  The interpretations I
&gt; have always seen include:
&gt;
    I don't think that Robert's rules are very relevant to our 
proceedings, since Roberts is very largely concerned with determining 
who has the floor in a linear debate, and our email procedure is 
a free-for-all in which we all have the floor simultaneously; 
also, our voting procedure will be very different.  We have too many
important exceptions to Robert's Rules to formally adopt it as a
parliamentary standard.
 
&gt; 1.  The concept of 'quorum' does not apply to email votes, since everyone
&gt; (or at least far more than half) can be presumed to have received email
&gt; notification of the vote.   Another way to view this is as a 'letter
&gt; ballot,' for quick a 'quorum' does not apply (because they are sent to
&gt; everyone).     I believe this is the widely accepted practice for email
&gt; groups.  Comment?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. ABSTAINS are not counted in determining the outcome of a vote.  What
&gt; counts is the ratio of YES to No votes.
&gt;
   I think that the notion of a quorum is quite relevant, but needs to
be 
defined differently.  It is not enough to suppose that everyone has
received
a mailing, and is therefore aware of the issues.  Since the volume on
our list is so large, and the "subject" often uninformative or
misleading,
even one very highly motivated to participate (I am an example) may not
have
time to read all the postings, and may miss something of relevance to 
his/her interests.  That is why I think that the "abstain" vote may be
very effectively used as a "quorum" measure, to determine the number of
participants "present" in any given deliberation.  I would consider a
required "quorum", measured by the total number of votes for, against, 
or abstain, to be half the number of registered voters.
   The rationale for this is to be certain that formal decisions have 
received some level of meaningful consideration by the entire
membership, 
even if that consideration is in effect is to state "I am not interested
in
this issue or trust others to make the decision, and therefore abstain."
 
&gt; 3. I believe we should require more than one 'second' to conduct a vote.  A
&gt; vote in a physical meeting can take 15 seconds, but via email it can take
&gt; weeks. I suggest the level of support should be about half as many votes as
&gt; would be needed for that position to prevail.  I have previously posted a
&gt; complicated formula for determining this number, but I'm now thinking we
&gt; should just pick a number (about 5)  and change it later if the groups
&gt; wants.    The clause might (this is not yet a motion) read, "A total of 5
&gt; voting members must support a motion or amendment before it can be brought
&gt; to a vote."
&gt;
    No objection to this suggestion.

&gt; 4.  In the past, we have made many minor decisions without voting, by the
&gt; Chair saying, "Does anyone object to ..."  Once we have some documents in
&gt; development, the Technical Editors will also need to determine rough
&gt; consensus without taking numerous votes.    Under RRO, as Bob has educated
&gt; us, a single objection forces a vote.  I believer a greater number should be
&gt; required and suggest about 5.  The clause might read, "The Chair or
&gt; Technical Editor may determine consensus by asking if there are any
&gt; objections to a motion, proposal, or position.  If 5 or more object, the
&gt; item is not accepted."
&gt; Comments?
&gt; 
    If this "acclamation" procedure is used, I think a single objection
should suffice to force a vote, provided it is accompanied by
some rationale for the objection.  A simple "I object" should not
be sufficient.  If the SUO is to be taken seriously as the result of
careful deliberation, I think we should not try to find ways to
avoid formal votes.
