fyi...    thought this might be amusing (and maybe informative).

Comment on standards

&gt; The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4
feet,
&gt; 8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge
used?
&gt; Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S.
&gt; railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English build

&gt; them that way?Because the first rail lines were built by the same
people
&gt; who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used.
Why
&gt; did "they" use that gauge?  Because the people who built the tramways
&gt; used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which

&gt; used that wheel spacing.  So why did the wagons have that particular
odd
&gt; spacing?  Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon
wheels
&gt; would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England,
because
&gt; that was the spacing of the wheel ruts. So who built those old rutted
&gt; roads?  The first long distance roads in Europe  (and England) were
&gt; built by Imperial Rome for their legions.  The roads have been used
ever
&gt; since. And the ruts in the roads? The ruts in the roads, which
everyone
&gt; had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels, were first
&gt; formed by Roman war chariots.  Since the chariots were made for (or
by)
&gt; Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. The

&gt; U.S. standard railroad gauge of 4 feet-8.5 inches derives from the
&gt; original specification for an Imperial Roman war chariot.
Specifications
&gt; and bureaucracies live forever.  So the next time you are handed a
&gt; specification and wonder what horse's ass came up with it, you may be
&gt; exactly right, because the Imperial Roman war chariots were made just
&gt; wide enough to accommodate the back end of two war horses. Thus we
have
&gt; the answer to the original question.
&gt;
&gt; Now for the twist to the story. When we see a space shuttle sitting on

&gt; it's launching pad, there are two booster rockets attached to the side

&gt; of the main fuel tank.  These are solid rocket boosters, or SRB's. The

&gt; SRB's are made by Thiokol at their factory in Utah. The engineers Who
&gt; designed the SRB's might have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but

&gt; the SRB's had to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch
&gt; site. The railroad line from the factory had to run through a tunnel
in
&gt; the mountains. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track,
and
&gt; the railroad track is about as wide as two horses' rumps. So, a major
&gt; design feature of what is arguably the worlds most advanced
&gt; transportation
&gt; system was determined over two thousand years ago by the width of a
&gt; horse's ass!
&gt;
&gt; Don't you just love engineering?!
