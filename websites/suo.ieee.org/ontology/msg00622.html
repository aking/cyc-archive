Hi All,

	I've heard from David Whitten and Graham Horn on these proposed
changes.  Both argued for retaining  the part of the merged ontology that
covers the formal theory of holes and on one has objected to this, so, as I
mentioned in an email yesterday, I'll put this part back into the ontology.
As for the simplified upper-level classes and associated docu-strings, David
Whitten asked for a couple of clarifications, which I tried to provide.
Accordingly, if no one objects, I'll incorporate the simplified class
structure and docu-strings into the merged ontology as well.

&gt; Subject: Proposed Changes to Merged Ontology
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I am considering making three major changes to the 
&gt; version of the merged ontology document that I sent out on 
&gt; January 12th, and I would like to solicit comments.  The 
&gt; proposed changes are as follows.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Simplify the tip of the ontology so that it has the 
&gt; following structure.
&gt; 
&gt; (subclass-of Individual Entity)
&gt; (subclass-of Relation Entity)
&gt; (subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; (subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; (subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; (subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; 
&gt; (subclass-of Object Physical)
&gt; (subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; (subclass-of Process Physical)
&gt; (subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; (subclass-of Schema Abstract)
&gt; (subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; (subclass-of Script Abstract)
&gt; (subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; (subclass-of Structure Relation)
&gt; (subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; (subclass-of Situation Relation)
&gt; (subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; 
&gt; For reference, the original upper-level class hierarchy, as 
&gt; proposed by John Sowa, is as follows.
&gt; 
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Independent Entity)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Relative Entity)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Mediating Entity)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; 
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Actuality Independent)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Actuality Physical)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Form Independent)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Form Abstract)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Prehension Physical)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Prehension Relative)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Proposition Relative)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Proposition Abstract)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Nexus Physical)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Nexus Mediating)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Intention Abstract)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Intention Mediating)
&gt; 
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Object Actuality)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Process Actuality)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Schema Form)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Script Form)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Juncture Prehension)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Juncture Continuant)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Participation Prehension)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Participation Occurrent)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Description Proposition)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Description Continuant)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of History Proposition)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of History Occurrent)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Structure Nexus)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Situation Nexus)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Reason Intention)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Reason Continuant)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Purpose Intention)
&gt; ;;(subclass-of Purpose Occurrent)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Recast the docu-strings for the high-level concepts in 
&gt; non-philosophical language (so that their meaning is clear to 
&gt; engineers without a philosophical background).  The revised 
&gt; docu-strings follow.
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Abstract "Pure information as distinguished 
&gt; from any particular encoding of the information in a physical 
&gt; medium.  Instances of Abstract can be said to exist in the 
&gt; same sense as mathematical objects such as sets and 
&gt; relations, but they cannot exist at a particular place and 
&gt; time without some physical encoding or embodiment.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do 
&gt; not have spatial dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, 
&gt; grammars, and the data structures of computer science.  All 
&gt; the syntactic forms in natural languages, programming 
&gt; languages, and versions of symbolic logic are included under 
&gt; Arrangement.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Assembly "A CorpuscularObject whose discrete 
&gt; parts are completely separable. Whether something is 
&gt; considered an unstructured collection or a structured 
&gt; assembly depends on some agent's intention.  A car in working 
&gt; order is a highly structured assembly.  But if the parts were 
&gt; disassembled and spread out on some surface, it would be 
&gt; called a collection.  Yet if the parts were arranged to spell 
&gt; the word 'CAR', they would again form an assembly, although 
&gt; not one that could be used for transportation. Conversely, if 
&gt; a car were towed to the junk yard, the junk dealer might 
&gt; consider it a collection, even though the parts were in the 
&gt; same order they had been in while it was running.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Attribute "Primitive schemas, i.e. schemas 
&gt; that cannot be defined in terms of other schemas.  Some 
&gt; examples are:  colors, tastes, intensities, etc.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation CaseRole "The class of predicates relating the 
&gt; spatially distinguished parts of an occurrent. Case roles 
&gt; include the agent, patient or recipient of an action, the 
&gt; flammable substance in a burning process, or the water that 
&gt; falls in rain.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation ComponentRelation "An umbrella class for any 
&gt; binary relation that relates an Object to an aspect of that 
&gt; object.  The three elements of ComponentRelation are part-of, 
&gt; property-of, and stage-of.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Continuant "A continuant is an entity whose 
&gt; identity continues to be recognizable over some extended 
&gt; interval of time.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is 
&gt; indefinitely divisible to the limits of perception by the 
&gt; available sense organs or measuring instruments.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation ContinuousProcess "A process in which 
&gt; incremental changes take place continuously.  This is the 
&gt; normal kind of physical process.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation CorpuscularObject "An Object that has 
&gt; separable parts.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which 
&gt; is typical of computer programs or idealized approximations 
&gt; to physical processes, changes occur in discrete steps called 
&gt; events, which are interleaved with periods of inactivity 
&gt; called states.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals.  
&gt; This is the root node of the ontology.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation HomogeneousObject "A ContinuousObject in which 
&gt; every part is similar to every other in every relevant 
&gt; respect, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, 
&gt; etc.  An example would be a beaker of pure distilled water in 
&gt; a controlled environment.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Individual "An entity that can be 
&gt; characterized independently of any relationships it may have 
&gt; to other entities.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation KineticForm "Includes the information in a 
&gt; reel of motion picture film or the patterns and equations for 
&gt; generating motion in virtual reality.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Object "A Physical Continuant which retains 
&gt; its identity over some interval of time. Although no physical 
&gt; entity is ever permanent, an object can have stable 
&gt; properties over its lifespan. The type Object includes 
&gt; ordinary physical objects as well as the instantiations of 
&gt; classes in object-oriented programming languages.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a 
&gt; stable identity during any interval of time. Formally, 
&gt; Occurrent satisfies the following conditions:
&gt;    * The temporal parts of an occurrent exist at different times.
&gt;    * The spatial parts of an occurrent may exist at the same 
&gt; time, but an occurrent may have 	different spatial parts 
&gt; at different times
&gt;    * There are no identity conditions that can be used to 
&gt; identify two occurrents that are 	observed in 
&gt; nonoverlapping space-time regions.
&gt; A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different 
&gt; stages of a life cannot be reliably identified unless some 
&gt; continuant, such as the person's fingerprints or DNA, is 
&gt; recognized by suitable identity conditions at each stage. 
&gt; Even then, the identification depends on an inference that 
&gt; presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation OrganicObject "A CorpuscularObject such as a 
&gt; tree or flower that has parts that are not completely 
&gt; separable, even though there are discontinuities.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Physical "An entity that has a location in 
&gt; space-time.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent 
&gt; specification of actions and events: including: computer 
&gt; programs, finite-state machines, Petri nets, robot commands, 
&gt; cooking recipes, musical scores, conference schedules, 
&gt; driving directions, and the scripts of actions and dialog in 
&gt; plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent 
&gt; a dynamic process, it may have static parts.  In a movie 
&gt; film, for example, the sequence of images is a script that 
&gt; determines the motion, but each frame is a schema of a static image.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Process "A Physical Occurrent during the 
&gt; interval of interest. Depending on the time scale and level 
&gt; of detail, the same actual entity may be viewed as a stable 
&gt; object or a dynamic process. Even an entity as stable as a 
&gt; diamond could be considered a process when viewed over a long 
&gt; time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In logic, 
&gt; the assertion of a proposition is a claim that the 
&gt; abstraction corresponds to some aspect or configuration of 
&gt; the entity or entities involved. As an example, the statement 
&gt; cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat characterizes the 
&gt; entity named Yojo.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some 
&gt; other entity.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Schema "An Abstract form that has the 
&gt; structure of a Continuant and, thus, does not specify time or 
&gt; timelike relationships. Examples include geometric forms, the 
&gt; syntactic structures of sentences in some language, or the 
&gt; encodings of pictures in a multimedia system.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Script "An Abstract form that has the 
&gt; structure of an Occurrent and, thus, represents time 
&gt; sequences. Examples include computer programs, a recipe for 
&gt; baking a cake, a sheet of music to be played on a piano, or a 
&gt; differential equation that governs the evolution of a 
&gt; physical process. A movie can be described by several 
&gt; different kinds of scripts: the first is a specification of 
&gt; the actions and dialog to be acted out by humans; but the 
&gt; sequence of frames in a reel of film is also a script that 
&gt; determines a process carried out by a projector that 
&gt; generates flickering images on a screen.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Sign "A Sign is considered as representing 
&gt; something to some agent.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Situation "A Relational entity considered as 
&gt; an Occurrent. A situation relates the participants in some 
&gt; process, whose stages may involve different participants at 
&gt; different times.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation Structure "A Relational entity considered as a 
&gt; Continuant. A structure relates multiple objects whose 
&gt; connections constitute the structure.")
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject that 
&gt; nonetheless varies in, e.g., temperature, chemical 
&gt; constitution, density, etc.  An example would be a large body 
&gt; of water such as the ocean.")
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  The third proposed change is to eliminate the axioms of 
&gt; the "Theory of Holes".  As I see it, these axioms are very 
&gt; interesting, but they are also controversial and probably 
&gt; more relevant in a philosophical context than an engineering 
&gt; one like the SUO.
