Oops!  I must be tyred ...

I forgot to tip due credit for
that Google Search, its result,
or excerpt, so here t'ar, Mack!

In addition, if more incidentally, the article phonetically known as
"Plain Language In Documents And Paperwork Reduction Act" (PLIDAPRA)
requires me to rephrase my "Genreic Disclaimer" in a plainer manner:

| Who thinks that I'd be stealing his trash,
| Has sooner likely been stealing my Peirce.

&gt; 
&gt; GENREIC DISCLAIMER
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  The writer writes under the presumption that the substance,
&gt;     if any, of what he writes is characterizable under either
&gt;     one of two cases:
&gt; 
&gt;     a.  Wholly derivative subsidiary to the works
&gt;         of one Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914).
&gt; 
&gt;     b.  Wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  If the writer writes anything, the substance of which,
&gt;     if any, he presumes to originate with himself, he will
&gt;     be sure to make a special note of it, and to issue the
&gt;     appropriate notification.  Otherwise, the presumption
&gt;     may safely revert to that covered in Clause 1, above.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  If any other writer, or representative of a fictive
&gt;     entity, intelligent of otherwise, should presume to
&gt;     imagine that he, she, it sees in the writing of the
&gt;     present writer some reflection of his, her, its own
&gt;     original and proprietary thought, then the present
&gt;     writer suggests what is most likely the much safer
&gt;     presumption, in deed, he puts forth a claim as to
&gt;     what is most likely the much greater probability,
&gt;     that the other writer or representative exhibits
&gt;     thereby the lack of due diligence required to
&gt;     establish the truth of the matter, to wit,
&gt;     that the substance, if any, of what the
&gt;     other writer writes is characterizable
&gt;     under either one of two cases:
&gt; 
&gt;     a.  Wholly derivative subsidiary to the works
&gt;         of one Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914).
&gt; 
&gt;     b.  Wrong.

&gt; [ A whole lot of non-motor-city-related stuff,

&gt; &gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cars run on roads, but one doesn't do vehicle design by looking at tarmac.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, one does ...
&gt; 
&gt; Google Search on  &lt;vehicle design tarmac road asphalt&gt;
&gt; turned up 322 hits.  Not to be picky, I deal the card
&gt; off the top of the deck, which oddly enough turns out
&gt; to be on AI (Accident Investigation), very intriguing:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; AI's make increasing use of computer software packages to
&gt; &gt; process and analyse specific accident data and trajectories
&gt; &gt; accurately.  The data input is derived from:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -- mathematical models, formulas and calculations derived from the laws of physics
&gt; &gt; -- statistical correlations collected from previous RTAs and field test results
&gt; &gt; -- vehicle occupant crash models
&gt; &gt; -- pedestrian impact models
&gt; &gt; -- manufacturers' vehicle handling and tyre performance data
&gt; &gt; -- independent research investigations
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Forensic science, based on Locard's Principle
&gt; &gt; that states 'every contact leaves a trace' is
&gt; &gt; as important to road traffic accidents as it
&gt; &gt; is to murder scenes.  The difference is that
&gt; &gt; the AI is dealing with tyre marks and vehicle
&gt; &gt; damage rather than fingerprints and cloth fibres.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The maximum cornering speed a vehicle is capable of can be also be determined
&gt; &gt; by the friction value of the road surface.  Attempting to negotiate too tight
&gt; &gt; a corner or bend at a speed beyond the critical limit is one of the main causes
&gt; &gt; of vehicle occupant fatalities.  The front tyres remain on their steered course,
&gt; &gt; but the unsteered rear wheels loose adhesion, putting the car into a spin which
&gt; &gt; presents one side of the car, (the least protected part) to the front.  Should
&gt; &gt; the side of the car hit a lamp post, tree or another approaching vehicle the
&gt; &gt; chances of escaping injury are very low.  Impact depth is calculated at
&gt; &gt; one inch for each mph of impact speed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Now, this is about AI, but I think that
&gt; the impacts on vehicle design are clear.
&gt; I was going to invert the metaphormasis
&gt; to derive the bearing of this lesson on
&gt; the relation between logic and semiotic,
&gt; but, of course, Peirce already did that:
&gt; 
&gt; | 'On the Definition of Logic'.
&gt; |
&gt; | Logic will here be defined as 'formal semiotic'.
&gt; | A definition of a sign will be given which no more
&gt; | refers to human thought than does the definition
&gt; | of a line as the place which a particle occupies,
&gt; | part by part, during a lapse of time.  Namely,
&gt; | a sign is something, 'A', which brings something,
&gt; | 'B', its 'interpretant' sign determined or created
&gt; | by it, into the same sort of correspondence with
&gt; | something, 'C', its 'object', as that in which it
&gt; | itself stands to 'C'.  It is from this definition,
&gt; | together with a definition of "formal", that I
&gt; | deduce mathematically the principles of logic.
&gt; | I also make a historical review of all the
&gt; | definitions and conceptions of logic, and show,
&gt; | not merely that my definition is no novelty, but
&gt; | that my non-psychological conception of logic has
&gt; | 'virtually' been quite generally held, though not
&gt; | generally recognized.  (CSP, NEM 4, 20-21).
