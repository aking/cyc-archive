Jon,

I, like many other subscribers to SUO list, agree with
John Velman's request:

JV&gt; Can you possibly put aside the poetry
&gt;&gt;&gt; and word play for a while ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; and get succinctly to the technical
&gt;&gt;&gt; (or philosophical, if you will) point?

John was trying to make a constructive suggestion.

JA&gt;I really do not understand this conduct.
&gt;&gt;I do not make a practice of suggesting
&gt;&gt;prior constraints on what other people
&gt;&gt;choose to contribute, of telling them

He was not trying to constrain what you contribute,
but trying to suggest a way of writing that will encourage
people to read what you have to say rather than pressing the
delete button as soon as they see your name on a message.

JV&gt;I meant this with the best of intentions as advice on how to reach some of
your
&gt;audience more effectively.

And I believe that his points are shared by a great many
people who subscribe to SUO list:

JV&gt;Of course you are free to take my advice or not.  I also understand that

&gt;this is just my view, and I'm not claiming that my view is the consensus
&gt;view, or even a view shared by anyone else.   If you don't think the advise

&gt;is good advice, OK.

JA&gt;so I do not comprehend why other people
&gt;&gt;feel like they can take these unreciprocal
&gt;&gt;liberties with what I am given to do here.

John V. is saying politely what other people have said
much more bluntly.  He is not "taking liberties", but he
is making the point that your style is getting in the way
of substance -- i.e., your potential readers are tuning out.

&gt;&gt;I write the way that I think -- it is not
&gt;&gt;being made up to be anything else but that.
&gt;&gt;I do believe that I write in several diverse
&gt;&gt;styles -- could be it's only me who thinks so --
&gt;&gt;and some of them I believe are very detailed,
&gt;&gt;rigorous, succinct, even terse, to the point
&gt;&gt;that they bore me to tears if not everyone else.

I forget exactly where Chekhov said it, but in describing
his writing style, he made an excellent suggestion:
whenever he wrote a passage that he was especially proud of,
he realized that it was more an act of self-indulgence
than an effective way of communicating with his audience.
Therefore, he deliberately deleted it.

&gt;&gt;I am doing the best that I can,
&gt;&gt;I am tired of trying to be sorry,

I think you are capable of doing much better, but you need
some drastic self-editing.  If you can't bring yourself to
kill your babies, as Chekhov did, perhaps it would be best
to ask someone else to read your notes before you send them
-- perhaps your wife or a colleague -- and not to spare
the eraser.

John Sowa
