Jon, 
	.	I can summarise all your responses below by reacting to your
claim: 

*	"I have done nothing but tell you the upshot of the lessons I've
learned since I came on board.  The catch seems to be what it's always been,
that unless you have had a similar experience, then nothing resonates enough
to get through what you'll just go on believing till it happens to you".  

	.	My reaction remains the same it has been for a long time
now, and is that, unfortunately, you never give concrete examples that allow
verification of your claimed experiences.

	.	When you give examples, ones that are self­evidently
unarguable, or that the experts in the group mostly support you on, then we
will have to sit up and take notice.  

	.	Accordingly, I suggest you change your approach, and
concentrate on substantiating your claims, rather than just stating their
upshot. The more fundamental and self­evident the substantiations, the
greater the persuasive power they will have.

&gt; Jon,
&gt;
&gt; I believe you try to be far too complex too soon.
&gt; 
&gt; We are at the start of a significant project akin
&gt; to a baby learning about life.  The difference is
&gt; that we have been trained in language, logic, etc
&gt; to far greater extents than a baby.  That means
&gt; we can develop the structures far quicker if
&gt; we apply ourselves.

The evidence is against you.

&gt; Of all the fads you followed, have you ever catalogued the
&gt; stumbling blocks, and looked at how others got past them?
&gt; I suspect different projects stumbled at different points.

I have done nothing but tell you the upshot of the lessons
I've learned since I came on board.  The catch seems to be
what it's always been, that unless you have had a similar
experience, then nothing resonates enough to get through
what you'll just go on believing till it happens to you.

I never used to believe that stuff about paradigmatic
incommensurabilty, but this group has taught me a lot
about relative primality, and we seem to be headed
for a GCD of 1, where the outcome will be dictated
by the LCD of the relevant competencies.  I get the
feeling that it's the way some people want it to be.
Me, I will just chalk it up -- yet another screech
on the slate that nobody can hear -- to experience.

&gt; Furthermore, I suspect that insufficient application was
&gt; applied to overcome the quandaries.  If you're so sure
&gt; they're doomed, how about demonstrating actual cases,
&gt; and showing where they got to, and points they
&gt; COULDN'T get past?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not a fantasiser, and respect true show­stoppers.

Yes, and no.

&gt; However, I have succeeded at what others have assured
&gt; me were impossible numbers of times before.  It was by
&gt; developing solutions to problems others gave up on, or
&gt; else finding pragmatic ways to bypass them.

Dream on -- I wil try not to wake you up in future.

&gt; A key aspect of the sort of system that will work for
&gt; this project's sort of purpose is absolute pedantry
&gt; in the implementation.  Otherwise, of course, one
&gt; loses the unambiguity quality we require.  Many
&gt; people don't have that sort of patience or
&gt; persistence.

You are confusing pedantry with rhetoric --
I realize that they are closly akin ...

&gt; Another aspect is that, when a structure turns out to have
&gt; significant shortcomings, such as the ether theory in physics,
&gt; then one has to abandon previously developed structures incompatible
&gt; with an alternative structure that overcomes the identified weakness.

Typically, the conversion comes when those who believe the old myth die off.

&gt; To me, your approach is akin to the physicists and astronomers
&gt; of this world having given up and said:  "It's all too puzzling,
&gt; so we're going to abandon our work."

I've been telling you what I think it makes sense to do.
You do not hear.  You got your own buzz on.  So it goes.

&gt; Well, they're still at it, despite many abandoned "fads".
&gt; 
&gt; So are the software developers who have to take similar approaches
&gt; to provide additional features incompatible with their previous
&gt; structures.  Not all of them are Microsofts either.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why your songs don't ring true.
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Give me examples that are truly insuperable,
&gt; and then I'll stop until I find a practical
&gt; way round.

This is just talk.

So is this.

And this.

Ditto.
