Dear all, 
	.	I have recently had the chance to start looking at the
content we have so far. 

	.	Jim Schoening pointed me towards some lists Ian Niles and
David Whitten have posted. These contain mainly what I think of as
"structural", rather than "semantic" content. 

	.	Is there significantly more SUO content elsewhere, or is
this all we have so far?

	.	I fully recognise the need to have sound logical structures.
Nevertheless, I'd be more than a little surprised if the "structural"
content is going to have the applicability many users will want, or amount
to the "several thousand terms" specified for the SUO. 

	.	Is semantic content intended to be included in the SUO? If
so, has there been any thought given to the form and coverage of this area?
I would have expected the intention to include generic things. The AIHW main
interest would, naturally, be related to subject areas of likely relevance
to health and welfare matters. 

	.	For example, in the medical / animal biology area, I would
expect inclusion of each of the major organs and physical features common in
vertebrates, especially bearing in mind the general commonality of these
features and the frequency with which most people deal with them (eg at a
butcher's shop).

Graham,
     Try opening it in Word (or your word processing software).

Jim, 
	.	At long last I got to look at these. 

	.	My software asks me what application to associate with these
files. Basically, I feel it doesn't recognise the ".kif" extension. 

	.	Any suggestions?

Graham,
       I'll forward you some content postings from Adam and Ian.  I assume
you've seen the 'Start Ontology.'

Thanks Jim, 
	.		Because I have been concentrating on the SUO-CE
issue, I am unaware of any SUO content listings, other than possibly a
structure submitted by (I think) Adam Pease in a PDF format a few weeks ago.
Have any been developed, or has that stage yet to begin in earnest? 

	.	If it has, where would I find it. I would like to see what
opportunities there are for adding in health and community service related
matter suitable for the SUO level.


Cheers   				Graham Horn

Hi All,

	It has just come to my attention that the "defrelation" and
"deffunction" terms and constructs that I used in the KIF files I sent out
this afternoon are not (yet) part of SUO KIF.  I guess I was assuming that
they would be included at some point in the future.  These definitions can
of course be recast in official SUO KIF by removing the "defrelation" and
"deffunction" wrappers.  It has also been pointed out to me that the KIF
version of the Core Plan Representation would be easier to understand if
comments regarding the key constants of this theory were inserted into the
file.  Accordingly, I have now inserted these comments, and the revised file
is attached.  I hope this helps.

-Ian

Hi All,

	We here at Teknowledge have been working on converting ontological
content into SUO KIF.  The sources for this conversion are those listed on
the "Candidate Content to be Merged into a Standard" web page (linked to the
SUO web site).  Our hope is that these various SUO KIF formalizations will
eventually be folded into the overarching SUO.

	As the first instalment in this project, I'm attaching three files
which are SUO KIF translations of the definitions and axioms of,
respectively,
*	Barry Smith et Al's theory of bona fide/fiat boundaries/objects
(Smith.kif),
*	Nicola Guarino et Al's theory of physical objects (Guarino.kif), and

*	the Core Plan Representation (CPR.kif).  
	We would appreciate any comments/criticisms you might have about
these formalizations and/or the original content.

Sincerely,
Ian Niles
