Jim,

Note On Venu.   I was going to take this discussion off the SUO list,
as some people there appear to be annoyed by the idea that semiotics
might have a history that predates their venerable YOB, but a second
thought tells me that I ought not to arrogate to myself the right to
remove a subject line that was instituted there by another authority.
So the compromise I find convenient to strike with my own conscience
is to disluxate our wranglings to a neighboring setting specifically
designated by the SUO Folks as a place for matters too ontologically
generic to have immediate bearing on their e-mediate scope &amp; purport.
Who knows, someday this depository may serve to settle their account
on some issue that they incre-mentally recognize is already grounded.

Information about subscribing to the Ontology subsite can be found at:

JR: I think, in any case, it is clear from his
    early ambitions that are expressed frequently
    in Volume 1 of the new chronological edition that
    the import of the phrase "all thought is in signs"
    is to locate thought in the observable signs themselves --
    such as, say, the signs on the screen right now (if you are
    reading this from the screen) -- as a relational property thereof,
    rather than thinking of signs as taking on sign-value because a mind
    somehow infuses them with meaning from its own "inner" resources.

&gt; Dear Joe, John, Folks --
&gt; 
&gt; I'm reminded of the old issue of whether a tree falling in the forest
&gt; makes a sound if no one hears it.  I conceive of thought as requiring
&gt; movement of actual signs (whether they be publicly manipulated or done
&gt; privately in ones own brain), but it does not seem to me that the force
&gt; that animates this movement or the actual objects moved is what constitutes
&gt; thought.  Rather, what constitutes thought is the representation and forecasting
&gt; of events.  I understand the expression "all thought is in signs" as meaning that
&gt; signs are tools of thought (with thought itself being a tool for forecasting the
&gt; outcome of events).
&gt;
&gt; Or to return to my opening sentence, thought is like a tree falling in the forest.
&gt; Sound  and fury is what some particular individual might make of it;  but, though
&gt; the dogs bark, the caravan of thought moves on.  Lastly, I'm reminded of something
&gt; I heard on NPR today.  Seems some musician and wit has observed that the British
&gt; are not particularly fond of music but they love the noise it makes.  As usual
&gt; I've probably mixed apples and bobbing for them, but, hey, what are friends for?
&gt; And as for my point -- Well, again, that's something I was hoping you all might
&gt; tell me.

FYSMI, this very same question came up in another woods aways back --
but then, what's a recursèd question for? -- so let me append this

Don,

Your question betrays
a certain assumption,
the assumption that
a tree cannot hear.

But I have heard ...
a tree to scream ...
as a blade, or a blaze,
or a blight comes near.

And we grasp there to be
no advantage to a scream,
to adapt, appease, avert,
if a creature's compeers
have no sense of hearing.

&gt; Oh what the hell.  I'm trying to say three things.
&gt;
&gt; One, that thought is the forecasting of events
&gt;      though the manipulation of signs.
&gt;
&gt; Two, that thought lies in the act of representation
&gt;      and forecasting not in the energy that animates
&gt;      these processes nor in some mysterious process
&gt;      by which signs are materialized.
&gt;
&gt; Three, that signs (even when employed covertly as in one's private thoughts)
&gt;        are necessarily public artifacts.  Public because the consequence of
&gt;        events, which thought is designed to forecast, is itself public.
&gt;        Not only are the events public but any attempt to symbolized
&gt;        them in a communicable form must ultimately be rooted in
&gt;        shared public experience if the communication is to be
&gt;        successful.
&gt;
&gt; Do these three points seem correct to you?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Jim

I'm going to think about your Tripos
a bit more before I try to answer it.
I go Holiday in a couple of weeks --
and I have got about a month's worth
of busywork to do before I can go in
peace, so it may a summerlong effort
to respond to them all as they merit.

Cheers,

Jon
