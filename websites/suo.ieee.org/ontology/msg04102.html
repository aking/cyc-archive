&gt;Adam,
&gt;
&gt;As I said in my earlier email, I am not in any way trying to suggest that
&gt;Cyc has failed - or indeed failed in any of its stated objectives. I am also
&gt;not trying to single it out in any way.
&gt;The comment was in relation to the PAR requirement that Bill named 3).
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me uncontroversial that this requirement overlaps with the
&gt;semantic level requirements that appear in the EAI Journal
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.eaijournal.com/">http://www.eaijournal.com/</A> or the OMG's EAI working group. Or indeed the
&gt;work that groups such as Matthew West's EPISTLE have been doing for years.
&gt;It is also clear that enterprise application integration is a major area of
&gt;spending for many corporations.

I agree.

&gt;I agree with you that IT products can fail for the 'reasons' you note below
&gt;rather than that they are not applicable. I also note that many successful
&gt;IT products suffer from a number of the 'reasons' you list below, so these
&gt;are not absolute barriers. I trust you will agree that the relative
&gt;importance of these reasons will depend upon the nature of the market - and
&gt;the market for semantic integration is different from that for, say, drawing
&gt;applications.

I agree.

&gt;It seems to me that if you want to make your argument, you need to do what
&gt;you studiously do not do. That is to say which of the reasons you list has
&gt;been the barrier to entry. None of them seem to me particularly relevant -
&gt;but I am open to an argument that shows they are.

I'm not sure which argument you are ascribing to me.  I don't believe that 
any one of the business reasons I cited have been the particular barrier to 
entry for those working in upper ontology.  Since Cycorp has been at this 
the longest, you might ask them for a list of the factors they feel may 
have inhibited greater success.  Doug has often said (including recently in 
respond to John Sowa) he feels Cyc is on track with the agenda he set out 
years ago.

&gt;You wrote: &quot;Past failure of a particular system can only be attributed to a
&gt;particular
&gt;implementation at a particular time by a particular company and may not
&gt;bear any relation to the future success of that or other companies.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Does this mean that one cannot attribute 'failure' to problems with a
&gt;general approach? I suppose this means that any kind of strategic thinking
&gt;is misguided.

It means simply that one cannot ascribe failure of an approach to &quot;failure&quot; 
of a particular company employing that approach.  Bill's original message 
stated &quot;If you want anecdotal evidence then there is anecdotal evidence
that Cyc has not been successful at this task.  If it were, the whole IT
industry would be lining up to buy Cyc software and consulting.&quot;

That's the point I was responding to.  I believe Bill has conceded the 
point as well.  He raised a reasonable issue and got a good response from 
Pierluigi.

&gt;As I wrote below:
&gt; &gt;It is important to get this straight, because if we have the answer to this
&gt; &gt;problem then the issue is just a marketing one. If we do not, it becomes a
&gt; &gt;methodological one.
&gt;Or with your list, a hardware performance, a documentation, etc. one.
&gt; &gt;From a strategy point of view (if one is allowed to take this) it is useful
&gt;to know where one can effectively make ones efforts.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Chris

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Chris,
&gt;    There are any number of reasons why a company with a product that is
&gt;indeed capable of solving a certain technical problem might not have wide
&gt;acceptance.  I'm *not* ascribing any of these to Cycorp or any other
&gt;company, just trying to show why your argument does not appear sound to me:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Hardware isn't powerful enough yet to make the solution high performance
&gt;2.  Vendor is charging too much
&gt;3.  Customers aren't happy with Vendor's licensing
&gt;4.  Vendor doesn't have enough, or cheap enough, or talented enough
&gt;application engineers
&gt;5.  Product was over-hyped
&gt;6.  Product marketing not effective
&gt;7.  Product sales team not effective
&gt;8.  Product documentation is not sufficient
&gt;9.  Product lacks effective support
&gt;10.  Any one of the above was true in the recent past, even though it's
&gt;good now
&gt;
&gt;There are also semi-technical reasons why a product might &quot;fail&quot; even
&gt;though a core idea is a good one:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Poor coding resulting in bad system performance
&gt;2.  Poor coding resulting in reliability problems
&gt;3.  Bad user interface
&gt;
&gt;..and all of these &quot;X is not good enough&quot; issues might be simply in
&gt;relation to other vendors which present some solution which is better along
&gt;one or more of these non-technical dimensions.  IBM and Oracle do a lot of
&gt;systems integration for example, and have extremely strong attributes in
&gt;many of these non-technical areas as well as technical ones.
&gt;
&gt;Past failure of a particular system can only be attributed to a particular
&gt;implementation at a particular time by a particular company and may not
&gt;bear any relation to the future success of that or other companies.
&gt;
&gt;It's also a stretch to claim the Cyc has failed since they in fact have
&gt;lots of application success stories.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I am not sure that what Bill or I were assuming was &quot;that corporations,
&gt; &gt;customers, etc. (i) know what they &quot;really need&quot; &quot; in the sense you are
&gt; &gt;talking about. The corporations know they have a problem - they are not
&gt; &gt;stupid - and they know they really need a solution. What they do not know
&gt; &gt;yet is what that solution is - they know full well they have not yet found
&gt; &gt;what they &quot;really need&quot;. If the amount of money spent on integration
&gt; &gt;projects is any indication - they regard it as a serious problem. As far as
&gt; &gt;I am aware it has been &quot;empirically confirmed&quot; that with serious problems
&gt;of
&gt; &gt;this type, corporations are usually prepared to try solutions proposed to
&gt; &gt;them that can demonstrate that they work. And the proposition is that if
&gt; &gt;something like your employer (Cyc) has been reasonably visible for a while
&gt; &gt;and has tried to persuade corporations to use its product (which I
&gt; &gt;understand it has) then it cannot have demonstrated to their satisfaction
&gt; &gt;that it is the solution. The argument seems to me unimpeachable. BTW this
&gt;is
&gt; &gt;not meant to denigrate Cyc - merely clarify what is not good for.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is your underlying point that Cyc (or whatever) is the answer to 3)? That
&gt; &gt;this is obvious to you and the other initiates. And that for some reason
&gt;the
&gt; &gt;large number of corporations with projects in this area do not 'get it'
&gt; &gt;despite the publicity that surrounds Cyc. And despite attempts by Cyc to
&gt; &gt;explain to them, and demonstrate, that it will work. This seems to me the
&gt; &gt;odd position. It also seems to me to underestimate the acumen of the large
&gt; &gt;number of people with considerable experience working in the area.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It is important to get this straight, because if we have the answer to this
&gt; &gt;problem then the issue is just a marketing one. If we do not, it becomes a
&gt; &gt;methodological one.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I support the point underlying Bill's comment that:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It seems to be recognized by many people who have chosen to join this
&gt; &gt; &gt; group
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that SUMO, OpenCyc or any similar effort will not achieve (3).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange format whereby
&gt; &gt; &gt;       owners of existing applications will be able to map existing data
&gt; &gt; &gt;       elements just once to a common ontology. This provides a degree of
&gt; &gt; &gt;       interoperability with other applications whose representations
&gt; &gt; &gt;       conform to SUO. This entails the SUO being able to be mapped to
&gt; &gt; &gt;       more restricted forms such as XML, database schema, or object
&gt; &gt; &gt;       oriented schema.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As he says &quot;If you want anecdotal evidence then there is anecdotal
&gt; &gt;evidence
&gt; &gt; &gt; that Cyc has not been successful at this task.  If it were, the whole IT
&gt; &gt; &gt; industry would be lining up to buy Cyc software and consulting.  This
&gt; &gt;would
&gt; &gt; &gt; be an unfair point if Cyc hadn't been around for so long.  Based on the
&gt; &gt;fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; that SUMO is essentially a Cyc-like architecture, I don't expect any
&gt; &gt;better
&gt; &gt; &gt; outcome for it.&quot; Though I suspect the truth is a little more
&gt;complicated -
&gt; &gt; &gt; the basic point seems to me correct, and important to recognise.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Application integration is currently a big headache for enterprises -
&gt;with
&gt; &gt; &gt; millions if not billions spent on it. Enterprises are eager for a
&gt; &gt;solution,
&gt; &gt; &gt; so if Cyc-type efforts were the solution then there should be some
&gt; &gt; &gt; significant evidence that they are working - not just anecdotes.
&gt; &gt;Presumably
&gt; &gt; &gt; if SUMO is the answer, then corporations would already be using it to
&gt; &gt;solve
&gt; &gt; &gt; their problems, and asking for more. Note this is not to denigrate the
&gt; &gt;work
&gt; &gt; &gt; that has gone into SUMO, just the naive assumption that it will resolve
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of problems noted in 3) above.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Chris, Bill et al.,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;with all respect due to its proponents, this is a very odd argument
&gt; &gt;indeed. For one thing, it presupposes what has been long and often shown
&gt; &gt;to be an incorrect assumption, that is, that corporations, customers, etc.
&gt; &gt;(i) know what they &quot;really need&quot;, and (ii) unfailingly recognize &quot;it&quot;
&gt; &gt;when they see it. You don't need to be a raving Troskyite (not that
&gt; &gt;there is necessarily anything wrong with that) to believe that (i) and
&gt; &gt;(ii) have been over and over empirically disconfirmed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Moreover, it's obviously possible to conceive of other explanations of
&gt; &gt;the same fact: for instance, that &quot;Cyc-type efforts&quot; so far have not
&gt; &gt;really focussed on addressing primarily the &quot;desperate needs&quot; mentioned.
&gt; &gt;Usually people make the naive assumption that their efforts will solve a
&gt; &gt;problem they have identified, not one they have not clearly formulated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The interesting question can then be raised about whether similar efforts
&gt; &gt;could be retooled and exploited to address such needs. Well, can they? I
&gt; &gt;for one would be most interested in hearing while either Cyc or SUMO or
&gt; &gt;IFF or...  _cannot_ in your view be so retooled. This seems like a clear
&gt; &gt;question, both theoretical and practical, which many (though not I, sorry
&gt; &gt;to report) here seem well equipped to address, although not one that
&gt; &gt;benefits greatly from polling imaginary customers, or so I feel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So let me try to reframe the issue: what is it about an ontology that
&gt; &gt;_would_ make it suitable to address these needs? And what is it with
&gt; &gt;existing ontologies that makes them unsuitable? I look forward to reading
&gt; &gt;your opinions.
