Bill, as usual, I will be forced to shift over to
CG or ONT whenever it's a topic of vital import
that requires more than one-a-day as its MDR.

BA = Bill Andersen
JA = Jon Awbrey

JA: I am going to limit myself to trying to get one single point across
    before I even think about going any further.  All of this talk about
    the expressive capacity or the representational power of FOL, in any
    given syntax for it, is simply not being contested, nor is it of any
    relevance to the questions of efficiency and the integrity of inquiry
    that I have been trying to address here.  All that is computable is
    turing-computable, and there are times when we actually do write out
    turing programs for all sorts of theoretical investigations, and yet
    no one in their right might would try to write a turing program to
    do their taxes, not unless they want to finish up the job in jail.
    So, all of this stuff about &quot;Show me something of clear and present
    practical import that I cannot represent in FOL&quot; is just beside the
    point.  The question is &quot;How well can it be done within the limits
    of this or that concretely specific syntax for FOL?&quot;  And the answer
    is almost always &quot;Not well&quot;.  It's the same way with roman numerals:
    How do you multiply roman numerals?  You convert them to decimals,
    multiply them out in that medium, and then convert the answer back
    to roman numerals.  Which is exactly how almost all of the apparent
    progress &amp; success in Principian Mold systems is actually achieved.

I will need to repeat my address of this one issue until I am sure it is clear.
 
JA: So, all of this stuff about &quot;Show me something of clear and present
    practical import that I cannot represent in FOL&quot; is just beside the
    point.  The question is &quot;How well can it be done within the limits
    of this or that concretely specific syntax for FOL?&quot;  And the answer
    is almost always &quot;Not well&quot;.

BA: Jon, that's a sweeping claim.  And it deserves some substantiation.
    I've been doing a lot of stuff over my career -- first in AI, and
    for the past seven years doing DB/ontology work, that works quite
    &quot;well&quot; and uses the &quot;broken&quot; syntactic variants of FOL.  I'm not
    the only one.  All database systems in widespread use today are
    in one way or another based on some variant of FOL (of course
    the model theories differ substantially).

No, I was there as these DB systems developed at many sites,
and in a few of my student jobs I used some of the early ones
on real, funded &quot;large data base&quot; applied research projects.
In the early days it was utter common knowledge that these
&quot;Relational Data Base Management Systems&quot; (RDBM's) were
based on Peirce's &quot;Logic Of Relatives&quot; (LOR).  I do not
know what it was, maybe people just read more back then.
Certainly the stuff on TV is not any better nowadays.

But we are going to have to get a whole lot more concrete as to what
in the devil we are talking about under the aegis and banner of &quot;FOL&quot;.

Go haul out your 'Principia Mathematica'.  That syntax I will call &quot;PriMat&quot;.
Sorry for the lack of a brief acronym -- I reserve &quot;PM&quot; for Pragmatic Maxim.

Nobody uses PriMat.  Never did.  Not for real.  I once took a course
in mathematical logic from a philosophy department where we started
with a 1970's upgrade of PriMat, kept in a Zoo for the amusement of
philosophers, and spent the better part of a semester working our
way up to proving the PriMat equivalent of &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;.  No joke.
A task like that is several orders of magnitude worse than doing
the same thing on a turing machine.  Who does that?  Logicysts.

So nobody uses PriMat for any &quot;substantially useful theory routinely applied&quot; (SUTRA).
But what they do do with their voodoodoo is this:  They import a very &quot;particular&quot;,
that is to say, a very analytic and atomistic &quot;Philosophy Of Logic&quot; (POL) that
once got swept through the door along with PriMat, and they wrap that atomizer
miasma of mist around whatever it is that any sensible ordinary person would
use to do the actual work.  And then whatever staged wonder that they manage
to perform by means of the means that really do the trick, they attribute
to the almighty mystical powers of this PriMat POL.

BA: That said, you may certainly be correct in saying that there is a better
    syntax out there.  But why all the diatribe?  Why not just come out and
    say that's where your concern lies?  It only takes a sentence or two.

I have been doing that here, a sentence or two or three at a time, for two years.

JA: It's the same way with roman numerals:  How do you multiply roman numerals?
    You convert them to decimals, multiply them out in that medium, and then
    convert the answer back to roman numerals.  Which is exactly how almost
    all of the apparent progress &amp; success in Principian Mold systems is
    actually achieved.

BA: I will even grant that to some extent.  But why not just propose
    some alternative that you think will work better rather than
    directing desultory shotgun blasts at FOL?  That would make
    for much more entertaining (and useful) reading for me anyway!

I've been doing that, one alternative at a time, for a lifetime.
One, FOL itself is not something that you can point a phaser at.
Two, whenever I point a critique at a concrete detail of syntax,
folks wrap themselves in banners or cloaks of &quot;abstract ideals&quot;,
and disappear from the scene of pragmatic computational reality.

Jon Awbrey
