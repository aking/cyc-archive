&gt; [please pardon me if this topic has already been breached]
&gt; 
&gt; In reacting to Jon Awbrey's post to on the SUO list, sent
&gt; during a private discussion, it occurs to me that this is
&gt; relevant to the PORT discussions, at least insofar as I'd
&gt; like to understand (for myself) the relation between what
&gt; Peirce posited about reality and the ongoing strivings of
&gt; the wider ontology-designing community to design that One
&gt; True Ontology. It's really hard to imagine that among the
&gt; gamut of thinkers among us, none are aware of the develop-
&gt; ment of the past thirty or so years in fuzzy logic theory
&gt; and chaos theory. A number of list members have written a
&gt; bit about it. How does it relate to Pragmatism, about the
&gt; development of &quot;global&quot; ontologies? I think it also might
&gt; relate in strange ways to our usage of markup, insofar as
&gt; we commonly equate markup with meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; In responding to Jon's message:
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg08297.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg08297.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; I like your comment on syntax not being so separable from
&gt; semantics, contrary to that common mistaken meme. Looking
&gt; at the world that TimBL begat with his Web language HTML,
&gt; it seems that &lt;I&gt; has taken on its own life despite those
&gt; of us who had better ideas about the separation between a
&gt; bit of markup and its presentation, much less its meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; We often seem to be left hanging in the space between our
&gt; concept of the ideal and the &quot;real,&quot; with those who opine
&gt; that the ideal is obtainable oft being those designers of
&gt; our software systems, opprobrious of the rest who believe
&gt; that a more &quot;pragmatic&quot; (read: need to get something done)
&gt; approach are wrongheaded. I've found myself in both camps
&gt; over the years, but have of late desired to spend more of
&gt; my time smelling the umbelliferous opopanax, weaning that
&gt; tendency of mine to wax idealistic, desiring that a world
&gt; out of kilter be changed in my favour. With the beginning
&gt; of a next world war in the incapable hands of a bellicose
&gt; and almost illiterate, unelected leader, the chances that
&gt; the world some might have envisaged in the 1970s would be
&gt; realized within my lifetime are quickly waning, sadly too.
&gt; 
&gt; You seem to have that fire in the belly, the wish to make
&gt; the sorts of necessary changes in the fundamentals of our
&gt; concept of knowledge that might affect the interfemorally
&gt; demanded intermezzo, the jigger-the-cojones to dash those
&gt; hopes of the likes of Sowa et al to conceive of the total
&gt; interconnectedness of all #$Things in lieu of the reality
&gt; of the true interconnectedness of all things at the level
&gt; of the Tao and mitochondria, that we all contain a vastly
&gt; more numerous population of &quot;foreign&quot; particula within us
&gt; than the count of our &quot;own&quot; cells, that our interconnect-
&gt; edness is more complex and compleat than can be dreamt of
&gt; in your philosophy Horatio, to quote again the oft-quoted.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not to say I don't think the striding towards the
&gt; ideal to be unworthwhile, it's just that I don't think we
&gt; will succeed except at the cost of limiting our abilities
&gt; to express ourselves, limiting the diversity of ideas and
&gt; the freedom of their expression.
&gt; 
&gt; We all want life (and our understandings and descriptions
&gt; of it to be oh so much simpler, and to quote the Jurassic
&gt; Park quote about Chaos Theory: how life has a certain way
&gt; of eluding containment and categorization, and if ontolog-
&gt; ical endeavours are to succeed, we can't avoid, ignore or
&gt; deride fuzziness but embrace it. I'm beginning to realize
&gt; now that the times I've spent reading in Taoism and other
&gt; relativisms wasn't misspent, also knowing that this might
&gt; not gain me any friends among those threatened by a less-
&gt; than-tidy world. I guess this's what originally attracted
&gt; me to James' Pragmatism and what spurs me on to read more
&gt; of Peirce, the idea that there may be some reasonable way
&gt; between the heaven and hells of ideal and pragmatic views,
&gt; leaving each to determine which is heaven and which hell.
&gt; Is this also related to those arguments on nominalism vs.
&gt; realism?

murray,

i think i first ran into fuzzy set theory in 1972 --
it is starting to scare me how many things lately
seem to be harking &amp;/v flashing back to that year --
while i was smack-dab in the middle of one of my
periodic foundational &amp;/v identity crises, while
desparately seeking any alternatives to satandud
set theory.

but i was always leary of the real numbers that
obtruded on the fuzzy scene as i knew what many
connectionists still fail to grasp:  that human
brains contain no exact real computers built-in.

still, i saw a connection to 3-adic logic way back then,
though i have not gotten to explore it much further yet.
my dissertation advisor does fuzzy optimal control, and
so we have now &amp; then discussed doing something with it.

here is how i breached &amp;/v broached the subject on the
suo list a couple of years ago, as cued by some fillip:

&gt; &quot;Clearer Fuzzy Product Quests&quot;
&gt; Interactive Week (08/07/00) Vol. 7, No. 31, P. 18;  Cleary, Mike:
&gt; 
&gt; A National Retail Federation (NRF) project might soon allow consumers
&gt; to use common-sense descriptors when searching the Internet for desired
&gt; products, making it easier to find a &quot;fuzzy&quot; sweater or &quot;plush&quot; towel.
&gt; The NRF is designing a product attribute system (PAS), more simply
&gt; described as a shared language.  XML tags would be attached to the
&gt; product descriptions in company databases' product listings.
&gt; The PAS would likely be owned and controlled by the NRF.

&lt;snip&gt;

Be the first in your neigborhood to PUN, PAS, &amp; KIK
the uniformly consinuous Epsilon-NRF-Ball!

Strangely enough, there is a funny sort of relationship between
ontological relativity (multi-perspectives?  poly-ontologies?),
fuzzy sets, and triadic relations (I am still guessing), perhaps
of the sort that JS had in mind.

Consider a fuzzy set as a triadic relation of the form x €^r S
among an element x, a degree of membership r, and a set S.
You may, of course, substitute &quot;concept&quot; for &quot;set&quot; if
you prefer that way of thinking about things.

Ask yourself:  Where do these assigned degrees of membership come from?
Imagine that they come from averaging the results of many judges binary
{0, 1} = {out, in} decisions.

Now consider the more fundamental triadic relation from which this
data is derived, the relation of the form x €_j S that exists among
an element x, an interpreter (judge, observer, user) j, and a set S.

If we use these sorts of relations as the basic formal structures of
our representation, then there is enough elbow room, I am guessing,
to have all of our cakes and to eat them too.  In other words, if
we consider JS's questions (&quot;World's Largest Individual Organism&quot;,
17 Aug 2000 08:56 EDT):

JS: | Do you represent a chair as a construction of wood and metal?
    | Do you represent it as an enormous buzz of interacting atoms?
    | Do you represent it as an object for human beings to sit on
    | without considering the details of its construction?

Then it becomes possible to give them the Joycean answer:

Yes.  Yes.  Yes.

The not so Joyce-ful task is to keep each view parameterized by the
community of interpretation that finds it compelling, interesting,
practical, useful, or &quot;to their purpose&quot; at a given moment, and
to figure out how to maintain a not-too-chaotic form and medium
of communication among these diverse communities.

Yes?  No?  Indifferent?
