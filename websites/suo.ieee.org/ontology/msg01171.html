Dear Colleagues,

Some time ago now I proposed a number of documents that together could help
us to manage, guide, and provide information about our work. Please find
below a first draft of one of these. The content is based on what is
available in the EPISTLE Core Model. Comments are welcome.

An Outline for the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology
Version 0.1

Editor: Matthew West - Shell Services International

Introduction

This document identifies the content for the IEEE Standard 
Upper Ontology. As such it represents a map of what has been 
developed, or what has been proposed. It is not a constraint 
on what may be, or is in the SUO. It will need to be updated 
as development progresses.

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the 
SUO, and to provide a means to manage and co-ordinate effort in 
developing the SUO.

The target audience for this document is those who are thinking 
of using the SUO to give them an idea of what it covers, and 
those who are developing the SUO to help to structure and relate
the work of development.

This document provides a textual representation of the areas to 
be covered, and the dependency between them.

Subject Area Descriptions

This section provides an informal description of the subject 
areas outlined in the previous section. All the objects

Thing

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all things.

Individual

Contains axioms and relations for apply to all things that 
exists in space time.

State

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all individuals 
that have a non-zero temporal extent.

Period of Time

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all individuals 
that cover all of space between two points in time.

Activity

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all individuals 
that are something happening to bring about change.

Physical Object

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all individuals 
that is a distribution of matter, energy, or both. 

Materialised Physical Object

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all physical 
objects that have essential continuity of material or energy, 
e.g. Car N199FOW.

Functional Physical Object

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all physical 
objects that have functional, but need not have material 
continuity, e.g. the Chairman of Shell.

Stream

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all physical 
objects that is material or energy moving along a path, e.g. 
a traffic stream flowing on the freeway, some liquid flowing 
in a pipe.

Temporal Boundary

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all individuals 
that have a zero temporal extent.

Point in Time

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all temporal 
boundaries that are across all space, e.g. 3pm 20th February 
2001 UTC.

Event

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all temporal 
boundaries that mark the beginning or end of some state.

Collection

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all things that 
have members.

Class

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all collections 
to which we attach significance.

Class of Individual

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
have only individuals as members, e.g. pump, car.

Quantifiable Property

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all Class of 
Individual that can be mapped to a number and unit of measure.

Role

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
indicate the role some thing plays in an activity or relation.

Status

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
are characteristics or qualities that is described by discrete, 
unordered values.

Organisational Level

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
define the level of structure, e.g. atom, molecule, cell, 
organism.

Shape

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
indicate the form of one or  more individuals.

Information Pattern

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
define a pattern, in one or more individuals, that conveys 
information.

Class of Class

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
have only other classes as members.

Number

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
class that are real, imaginary, or integer numbers.

Class of Relation

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
class that are classes of relation.

Specialisation

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
relations that indicate all the members of one class are 
members of another class.

Unit of Measure Mapping of Property to Number Space

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
relations that indicate that objects that a property maps to 
a particular number according to a particular unit of measure 
mapping.

Class of Representation

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
relations that indicate that a thing is represented by an 
information pattern.

Identification

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
representation that indicates that an information pattern 
stands for a thing.

Definition

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
representation that indicates that a thing must conform to 
the information pattern.

Description

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes of 
representation that indicates that an information pattern 
describes.

Relation

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all classes that 
have tuples as members.

Classification

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all relations 
that indicate a thing is a member of a class.

Cause and Effect

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all relations 
that indicate that an activity causes an event.

Whole-Part

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all relations 
that indicate that one individual is a part of another.

Fusion Whole-Part

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations that indicate that the whole is precisely the sum 
of the parts.

Arrangement Whole-Part

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations that indicate that the parts are arranged, but not 
necessarily touching, in order to a create a whole that is 
more than the sum of the parts.

Assembly Whole-Part

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations that indicate that the parts are assembled in a way 
that leaves them touching to make a whole. The nature of an 
assembly relation is that assembly and disassembly is simple 
and non-destructive. E.g. the assembly of a spark plug as 
part of an engine.

Feature Whole-Part

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations that indicate that the part is contiguous with the 
whole. Feature whole-part is not necessarily separable, and 
if separated, it cannot necessarily be easily reassembled.

Temporal Whole-Part

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations that indicate that the part is all of the spatial 
dimensions of the whole, but only a temporal part of it.

Participation in Activity

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations that indicate that a state of a whole individual 
is a participant in an activity.

Temporal Bounding of State

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations that indicate that a temporal boundary bounds a 
state.

Containment of Individual

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all whole-part 
relations where the part is contained by the whole.

Connection

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all relations that 
indicate that one individual is connected to another 
individual.

Temporal Sequence

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all relations that 
indicate that one individual (i.e. its whole spatio-temporal 
extent) precedes another.

Involvement in Activity

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all relations that 
indicate that a thing is involved in an activity. The 
difference between involvement and participation is that the 
involved object is a class or not contemporaneous with the 
activity, e.g. a discussion today about World War II.

Set

Contains axioms and relations that apply to all mathematically 
defined sets.
