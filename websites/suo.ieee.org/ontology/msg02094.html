I was afraid of a flame and there is a crossfire, what a wonderful forum!

Thanks Pat for recognizing my vulgarization capabilities :-)

&gt;
&gt;The word "intended" was an unfortunate interpolation in Aldo's
&gt;statement.  Intentions are most definitely not included in the
&gt;definition, since they are something to be defined rather than
&gt;anything that can be used to define something else.
&gt;
&gt;AG&gt;'Sign' is primarily a relation between an item from some vocabulary
&gt;&gt;&gt;of a language (natural, formal, or artificial), and an intended
&gt;&gt;&gt;meaning.
&gt;
&gt;PH&gt;Wow.  No wonder I havent been able to follow what Peircians have 
&gt;been saying.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That is what I would call a semantic relationship, but a very special
&gt;&gt;one (because of the 'intended'). In fact, it is a notion which I
&gt;&gt;would argue is not only not central to the current business of
&gt;&gt;ontology, but is actively dangerous and should be studiously avoided.
&gt;
&gt;I agree that any definition that included "intend" or
&gt;"intention" as a defining term would be useless for the
&gt;purpose of the SUO or anything else that must be computable.
&gt;

OK, dear Pat and John, I suspect that here we are talking of quite 
disparate issues.
I did not want to make a position about the usefulness of semiotics 
for computational ontology, but only to explain _briefly_ what is a 
sign in a certain tradition. My statement is a simplification under 
various respects.
If you want me undertaking an effort to evaluate the relations 
between computational ontology and semiotics, this is another story, 
and maybe a paper would be the minimal context to start a discussion 
(I have some draft material and reports; if you want, I can send you 
some).

BTW: by 'intended meaning' I mean exactly what the 'producer' of a 
statement wanted to express in some context for some purpose. The 
representation (or sign) relation in the semiotic (or semiologic in 
saussurean terms) tradition means more or less that: a relation 
between something - linguistic item, icon, gesture, or anything an 
agent _intends_ to use to express some meaning - and a meaning (or 
conceptualization). In the recent developments of semiotics, a 
meaning is - to say the least - multilayered: for example, for a 
lexical item used in a conversation, there is the meaning of the 
producer, the meaning of the contextual receiver (e.g. someone 
participating in a conversation with the producer), the meaning of 
someone who is not participating in the conversation but tries to 
reconstruct it, the meaning of a text containing the transcription of 
the conversation for an average reader sufficiently aware of the 
topic, the meaning of that text for a reader who is out of topic, or 
even from a different historical context or culture, and so on.
No surprise that the main applications of semiotics have been to 
literary or art criticism and advertising!

IMO, what computational ontology (as far as lexical items are 
concerned) is trying to do is formally approximating the 
conceptualization that an average reader from our current dominant 
(or shared) culture assumes when reading a lexical item. In other 
words, only some possible models for a lexical item are committed to 
in a given ontology. The more general an ontology claims to be, the 
more it assumes the conceptualization of that average reader 
independently of any context of use. The more domain-oriented an 
ontology is, the more it describes the conceptualization of an 
average reader for a restricted community or context. In this 
perspective, intentions are not _disturbing_ or _dangerous_ to 
computational ontology per se, but they should be _neutralized_ under 
certain conditions in order to give machines something that they can 
share with humans.
This kind of investigation has been already formulated by structural 
linguists and semioticians at least from the seventies (ask me the 
references if you like), and Ferdinand de Saussure made a fundamental 
distinction between 'parole' (the use of language, carrying 
intentions), and 'langue' (the language as system, carrying shared 
conceptualizations within a culture).
Some work was also done, but it was afflicted by some problems: 
primarily a lack of customers ;-), then the sad fact that those who 
formulated the methodology of investigation often lacked a good 
logico-mathematical background, and usually refused to define 
something similar to a SUO.

A top level ontology is a good idea also because it is neither to say 
that the relation between a lexical item and a conceptualization is 
one to infinite (this is the so-called 'arbitrariness' claim, namely 
a 'radical polysemy' assumption), but obviously nor that it is a one 
to one relation (polysemy is widespread).
What the evidence from ecological psychology (Gibson), cognitive 
semantics (Lakoff, Talmy, ..), neurolinguistics (Damasio, ..), etc. 
suggests is that in natural linguistic systems, such as natural 
language used by humans in non-formally controlled settings, the sign 
relation is not arbitrarily applied, but limited by certain 
cognitive-schematic invariants. Moreover, formal ontology 
investigated some areas that can be used as a formalization of the 
invariants deriving from the interaction between humans and external 
world (identity, part, connection, dependence, unity, etc.).


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pat Hayes wrote:
&gt;&gt;The difficult points for its intuition are:
&gt;&gt;1) a sign relation requires some context and participants in a
&gt;&gt;communication event;
&gt;&gt;2) the relational notion of sign - due to Peirce as well as to the
&gt;&gt;linguist Ferdinand de Saussure - involves the very complex issues
&gt;&gt;related to the way organisms conceptualize the external world
&gt;
&gt;Quite. So it would be inappropriate to use these ideas when 
&gt;considering formalisms to be used by things other than organisms. I 
&gt;would argue, in fact, that it is inappropriate to used them when 
&gt;analysisng the internal concpetual representations of the organisms 
&gt;themselves (the 'language of thought', in Fodor's terminology), but 
&gt;that is a larger debate which would take us beyond the SUO area.

IMVHO, ontology engineers should not spend too much time asking if 
ontologies are cognitively adequate (possibly not in Fodor's terms 
BTW), but SUO developers should be superficially aware of the current 
limits (and current reaches) of scientific investigation as far as 
internal representation of conceptualizations is concerned.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pat Hayes wrote:
&gt;&gt;3) humans explain intended meanings by way of languages, namely by
&gt;&gt;applying the sign relation over and over
&gt;
&gt;That is a very controversial claim. People also attribute meanings 
&gt;to their utterances by ostention, by indexical refernce, by 
&gt;nonlinguistic displays of intent, and in many other ways. Lakoff 
&gt;argues that much linguistic meaning is rooted in proprioception, in 
&gt;fact (and he has a LOT of data to back this claim up, including a 
&gt;substantial amount of recent neuroscience.)

Humans _explain_ conceptualizations by applying the sign relation 
(ostention, meaningful silence, etc. are applied within some semiotic 
system), while the internal representation has various modalities, 
including proprioception.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pat Hayes wrote:
&gt;&gt;For all
&gt;&gt;these languages, the 'sign' relation founds their semiotic similarity.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Re 1)
&gt;&gt;The (formal) definition (or primitive description) of a lexical item
&gt;&gt;is only an approximation of the average shared intended meaning for
&gt;&gt;some (possibly huge) domain.
&gt;
&gt;I don't follow this. The description of a lexical item has nothing 
&gt;to do with its meaning. Eg the words I am typing (on my screen) are 
&gt;in a sans-serif 10-point font. That is part of the description of 
&gt;the lexical item.

Ok, I was sloppy here: I meant the definition of the 
conceptualization of a lexical item.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pat Hayes wrote:
&gt;&gt;An actual intended meaning is given in a
&gt;&gt;certain spatio-temporal context with someone who 'produces' a
&gt;&gt;linguistic expression for a certain purpose, usually taking into
&gt;&gt;account the expected conceptualization capability of a 'receiver'.
&gt;
&gt;Yes. I hear this kind of emphasis on the essential nature of the 
&gt;immediate context again and again. I am suspicious. It reminds me of 
&gt;the kind of anti-scientific moaning that I used to hear from 
&gt;ethnomethodologists about how everything is so 'situated'. This 
&gt;strikes me as a mealy-mouthed excuse for not having a proper science 
&gt;(the world is so *complicated*, doctor; how can I be expected to 
&gt;produce any *general* theory with any *detail* when everything is so 
&gt;*complicated*?) Rubbish. Very few things are more complicated than, 
&gt;say, an ecosystem, or a mammalian nervous system, or a main-sequence 
&gt;star; yet science does a pretty good job of describing the main 
&gt;features of things like this. If the best that semiotics can do in 
&gt;the century or so since Peirce and de Sassure is to moan about how 
&gt;complicated Signs are, it needs to get a better methodology.

While I am not sure that a mammalian nervous system is more 
complicated than human communication system (one of its byproducts), 
I agree with you: complexity is not an excuse to escape scientific 
investigation.
On the other hand, neutralizing some aspects of semiotic reality for 
the sake of investigation or for feeding machines with human 
semantics does not imply ignoring them at all. I suppose we will make 
a better job by expliciting what we are neutralizing.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Re 2)
&gt;&gt;Lexical structures only partially map conceptualization structures
&gt;&gt;that only partially map external world structures. There are
&gt;&gt;cognitive and concrete invariants though, which are being
&gt;&gt;investigated.
&gt;
&gt;By whom? The only people who have even a snowball in hell's chance 
&gt;of finding anything out about actual conceptual structures are 
&gt;experimental psychologists and neuroscientists, with active 
&gt;collaboration from computer modellers of one kind or another. All 
&gt;else is just handwaving.

I tell something above (cognitive semantics, formal ontology). 
Anyway, experimental psychos and neuroscientists have a chance about 
the internal representation of conceptual structures, but others may 
have a chance with external representation, after all. There is some 
intersection, and it could be relevant in developing a SUO (for 
example: systematic polysemy, metaphorical mappings, basic cognitive 
schemata).

Thanks for comments
