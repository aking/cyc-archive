"Horn, Graham" &lt;graham.horn@aihw.gov.au&gt;:
&gt;Hi Lee and Rob (Skydog),
&gt;	.			While I understand where you're 
&gt;coming from, isn't it better to just get on with it at this stage?

That is precisely what most of us want to do. Why then are we being
constantly badgered about voting? (Which is, in case you were wondering, NOT
getting on with it. [GH&gt;	Agreed.])



&gt;	.	Yes, I have problems with the voting method, too. 
&gt;However, I feel the later approval stages is the time to really address 
&gt;them.
&gt;
&gt;	.	Personally, I believe the call for a vote, and the way it
&gt;was done was a mistake, but even Jim has apologised for that.
&gt;
&gt;	.	Many of us agree Ian's work is worthwhile. Matthew
&gt;is prepared to contribute to it, including scoping and technical
&gt;documentation. Ian is prepared to take on board comments and
&gt;criticisms, and rectify problem areas and faulty portions.
&gt;
&gt;	.	Meanwhile, Robert Kent is working on a new project
&gt;that may be of relevance to the overall effort.
&gt;
&gt;	.	Where's the problem?
&gt;

The problems for me are (1) wasted junk in my mailbox, 

GH&gt;	I have actually raised the issue of the intensity of discussion, and
the impacts it has on the energy resources available for the project. When
we talked about forming subject areas, as a means for grouping things that
was an approach to reducing this problem. Unfortunately, attempts to come up
with an orthogonal structure were torpedoed (apparently with the best of
intentions), and the exercise rendered inherently useless accordingly. I was
very, very disappointed about that. It was a real lesson to me about the
problems getting robust information structures in a group where not all
participants are used to dimensional analysis of information. 

GH&gt;	More recently we have had some pretty intense discussions about some
of the technical aspects. My perspective in hindsight is that much, but NOT
ALL, of this discussion grew out of misunderstandings between what one
person was saying, and what another thought they were meaning. It is a pity
we don't have a structure for co-ordinating contributions on such matters in
a way that facilitates contributors editing and building on what's there
already, instead of having each to state their entire own approach
individually. I am sure this has drained the group's resources
unnecessarily. Having said that, I have to admit I am not an expert in
developing this sort of structure, though I do have a gut feel that there
are better ways than we are now using in this regard. 

but more seriously (2) a nagging feeling that I'm being conned, to put it
frankly. Imagine some enthusiastic salesman who keeps telling you to just
sign this document which looks awfully like a sales agreement. He insists it
isn't one: he says it doesn't actually mean anything, it's just for form's
sake, it's a meaningless piece of straw documentation, don't worry your head
about it, etc. Every time you insist on actually looking at what you are
supposed to be signing, it turns out to be slightly differently worded from
the last time you looked. You are happy to go on looking at the cars and you
do intend to buy one, eventually, but you want to take your time and make
sure you get the one you want. But the guy won't take no for an answer: he
just keeps on and on insisting that you sign this piece of paper; and when
you do sign it, you can hardly see his heels for dust as he takes it into a
room marked 'legal department'.

Wouldnt you be a little suspicious?

GH&gt;	Ah! I think the difference is that we have more flexibility here
than the average car purchase. To take the analogy further I suggest we are
more akin to a Formula 1 racing car team.  
*	We have the opportunity to modify the car quite significantly, as
participants identify shortcomings, using the team resources. 
*	We can also throw away, or completely restructure, the car, or
significant parts of it, the moment we find some major design flaw or
potential major beneficial alternative that vastly improves the quality
(taking the holistic approach: eg. scope, flexibility, performance, user
friendliness, etc). With commercially produced cars these are called new
models. With commercial off the shelf (COTS) software these are called new
versions. In both cases, some are minor upgrades, while others are complete
re-engineerings of the product; 
*	In our case, the effort expended is not wasted, since we learn
lessons from it, hopefully one of our project documentation items will be
some form of record of the changes made and the reasonings involved, so that
any subsequent revisiting of an issue is informed by the previous experience
rather than needing to rediscover the issues involved all over again; 

GH&gt;	This is why I feel we are not so dependant on the sales document. I
suggest we are far more masters of our own destiny than with buying an
ordinary car.
