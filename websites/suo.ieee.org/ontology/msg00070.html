Pat --
   My understanding of the purpose (or one purpose) of the SUO
effort was to create a defining vocabulary of basic terms that will
allow a user to define a concept in terms of the SUO and thereby
permit someone with a different ontology to use the same concept,
with the same axioms and inferences, when two ontologies want
to transfer information.   What this requires is a set of basic
concepts that will allow differing perspectives on the same issue to
be represented, and allow differing perspectives to be recognized as such.
    Your point, as I understand it, has been asserted previously:

&gt; My point was that there isnt going to be (for the 
&gt; reasons which Chris outlined so cogently in his original message) one 
&gt; Good Enough Ontology, if 'good enough' means that it will accomodate 
&gt; all ontological perspectives reasonably well. You seem to think that 
&gt; this is like choosing a standard notation, but it's more like taking 
&gt; a definite position on every deep question in philosophical analysis 
&gt; for the last two thousand years, and declaring that particular 
&gt; combination of philosophical perspectives to be 'good enough' for 
&gt; everyone to use for any reasonable purpose. Why do you think that 
&gt; people have been arguing about this for so long, if they felt that 
&gt; one or another position was 'good enough'? 

      The question, whether one defining vocabulary can be found to 
express any chosen perspective, does not require that every perspective be
accepted as true in the basic ontology.  A standard upper ontology can
be used to define many incompatible "possible worlds", which, if properly
documented, will be recognized as incompatible.  We can define Newtonian
and relativistic mechanics using the same language -- that's my hope for
the SUO.
      The question your comment raises is whether there are some pairs
of concepts so fundamentally different that no common set of defining axioms

can serve to define both.  If we define both time points and time intervals,
and allow the users to decide which representation of time is best for
their applications, will any logical contradictions occur within the 
defining vocabulary?  More generally, it would be very important to 
have examples of differing viewpoints that appear to be so
fundamentally different that no basic set of axioms can define both.
If you could provide some examples of such incompatible concepts it
would be a great help in clarifying the fundamental issue we have to
deal with.
	
    To consider one of your specific questions:

&gt;  Do the axioms refer to things which endure through time, and 
&gt; consider these a fundamentally different kind of entity than things 
&gt; which happen at a time? Do they assume that truths are asserted at a 
&gt; time (and hence are implicitly or explicitly tensed) or are the 
&gt; assertions themselves timeless, and asserted about temporally located 
&gt; things? 
     Certainly, axioms serving as assertions about specific material 
objects in space-time till be time-dependent, but axioms used for 
defining classes of concepts by their relation to other objects will not
necessarily be time-dependent. The axioms might look very similar
in many cases, except for an explicit time point or time interval 
in assertions about objects in the real world.  Is there some
logical contradiction in believing that we can have both time-
independent definitional axioms and time-dependent assertional
axioms?

&gt; When the properties of something change with time, does one 
&gt; indicate this by referring to the time at which they hold, or does 
&gt; one regard the relations and properties as holding of temporal 
&gt; 'slices' of the things, or does one refer to the changes explicitly? 

   Do you think it is impossible to create one set of defining concepts
that will allow a user to assert facts using any one of these methods,
as seems best suited for the task?  
    It can be anticipated that different users might well create
different ontologies in which the axioms are contradictory.   This is 
unavoidable with any defining vocabulary -- one user says "yes" when
another says "no".  The function of the SUO in such cases is to 
point out the differing definitions used for similar objects, which 
will allow one system to adjust its reasoning about objects defined 
in other ontologies, and in favorable cases to recognize the different 
inferences that the other system must generate using its different 
definitions.  With a common defining vocabulary, there is a mechanism 
to allow correct inferences can be drawn (provided the two systems
exchange their definition set), and without a common vocabulary the 
chances may be nil in many cases.


&gt; Some things are easier to say in some ways than others; some 
&gt; things are unsayable in some combinations of answers, but those 
&gt; combinations are recommended by weighty ontological authorities armed 
&gt; with truckloads of scholarship, so you are going to have some mighty 
&gt; battles ahead. (Guarino agrees with Aristotle that all events 
&gt; ultimately derive from enduring continuants; other living 
&gt; philosophers agree with Heraclitus that the primary mode of existence 
&gt; is flux, so things supervene on events. People will still be arguing 
&gt; about this two millenia from now. Practical folk use whichever 
&gt; viewpoint is handiest, but then they don't have to be logically 
&gt; consistent.)
    The SUO goal is to find the most basic logical vocabulary in which
everything
is "sayable".  You seem to have no trouble describing the differences above
in English.  My belief is that if something can be defined in English, it 
can be defined in a logical language -- provided that it is meaningful, 
and the English is unambiguous in its intended context.


&gt; Whatever you decide, you had better get it done soon, as 
&gt; most of these files of axioms being produced will need to be entirely 
&gt; re-written, since every author writes axioms based on their own 
&gt; idiosyncratic answers to these (and other) questions, and their 
&gt; particular assumptions are built into their very way of thinking, and 
&gt; not made explicit, but are inconsistent with other author's implicit 
&gt; answers. 
    Here I strongly agree.  We need to work top-down to create the
defining vocabulary for the most basic concepts, and use those to 
create more complex concepts, and so on.  The temptation is to try the 
more interesting middle-level concepts first, which has the risk you
point out.

&gt; 
&gt; Guarino's mereology isnt compatible with Simon's, and neither of them 
&gt; are compatible with Tarski (last time I looked), so y'all had better 
&gt; decide which you want to believe. Most of the mereological accounts 
&gt; of space do not allow things like lines, surfaces or points to occur 
&gt; in the domain of discourse, and rapidly generate inconsistencies if 
&gt; they are allowed in, so you had better not meet anyone who wants to 
&gt; talk about the length or shape of a boundary line.
   If others agree that the goal of an SUO is to allow anything to be
defined, then we need to accommodate lines and points and open and closed
intervals as well as regions of space.  If someone wants to define
some concepts without using lines or points, those concepts should still
be very well-formed and well-defined.  If inferences on the objects 
defined in that way differ from those using points and lines, then
the users need to be aware of the differences and choose the 
representation that provides the reasoning power they need.


&gt; (Check the Cyc geography axioms pretty carefully, and be prepared to 
&gt; re-think them one at a time;
   Do you think there are logical inconsistencies in the CYC base KB?
(I think there are gaps that need filling, but that's a different
question).

&gt;  Holes require something like pieces of space in the ontology. . . .
    One might find that different people want to define holes 
or some other concepts differently.  The SUO should provide the vocabulary 
for any definition, but if there is a serious difference of opinion,
multiple distinguishable definitions (with different names) can be 
provided, and SUO should not require that any one definition be used.

&gt; (For example, Cyc doesnt make any firm distinction between a thing 
&gt; and the space it occupies, whereas most mereologies make a very sharp 
&gt; distinction.)
   There may be cases where some choices have to be made in the SUO --
certainly distinguishing between a region of space and the matter
that occupies it is likely to be one of them.  But does CYC really
fail to make any distinction?  That doesn't seem to follow from the 
fragment of CYC available publicly -- is it in there and I missed it, or 
is it something embedded in the unavailable reasoning mechanisms?

&gt; There isnt going to be a single UO which allows them 
&gt; all to coexist, and if you try to take a bit from one and a bit from 
&gt; another you will just get incoherence and muddle.
    If one views the SUO as some set of assertions about the real world
we live in, it does seem likely that there will be incompatible theories.
But if it is considered to be the logical language that can describe the
real world, with enough well-defined content referencing objects in the
real world so that it is not merely a set of symbols, then it is not
immediately obvious that it will not be able to represent all reasonable 
theories about the real world.  Mass, time (what we measure on clocks),
and meter are well-defined and provide a grounding for the other 
definitional symbols. Where there are gaps, new concepts can be defined.
If some new concepts are logically incompatible with existing content, 
existing content can be changed to allow defining both old and new 
concepts.  We can hope that this latter necessity will become rare
as the SUO matures.


&gt; There isnt a single 
&gt; 'reasonably general and correct' ontology: there are many ontologies, 
&gt; all general and all with as valid a claim to be 'reasonable and 
&gt; correct' as all the others, but sharply incompatible with each other. 
&gt; Some ambitious folk want their ontology to include a distinct entity 
&gt; for every fact that can be asserted in the language (Jerry Hobbs 
&gt; calls these 'eventualities'), which is going to be inconsistent with 
&gt; any SUO that anyone produces.
     Is it possible to define eventualities without mandating their
usage?  I am unfamiliar with this aspect of Hobbs's work.  Certainly 
there should be no problem in contemplating many individual instances 
of the concept "assertion" -- but I presume this is a different matter.

&gt; So, in spite of your protests, you ARE 
&gt; going to have to decide on a one true ontology, or at any rate a one 
&gt; standard ontology; and if that word "standard" is going to have any 
&gt; real meaning, then it might as well be written "true", since 
&gt; obviously the point here is to say that you can have any ontological 
&gt; color as long as it's black.
&gt; 
   Not necessarily "absolutely true" but useful enough to be valuable, 
for all those whose theories are definable in SUO terms, which 
may eventually be almost everyone.

&gt; 
&gt; PS. [Actually an alternative strategy would be to explicitly include 
&gt; all the alternatives into the SUO, using some kind of 'context' 
&gt; mechanism, maybe (?) To be really useful however this would need to 
&gt; be more powerful than the 'micro-theory' notion used in Cyc, which is 
&gt; really only a namespace-management tool. You would want to have 
&gt; axioms relating the various notions of 'part' in different 
&gt; ontologies, or the various ways of referring to time and change, in 
&gt; the form of mappings between contexts. It would go way beyond 
&gt; SUO-KIF, for sure.]
&gt; 
    The SUO itself should not contain logically incompatible axioms,
but when assertions are made about objects in the real world, 
contradictions can be readily generated.  If there are incompatible
Microtheories that are all useful, they could be maintained as 
extensions to the SUO.
    Once again, examples of concepts that simply can't both be defined with
the
same set of basic concepts will be very helpful.  The examples you have
given thus far seem to mostly address the inconsistent content of
differing definitions of the same word or assertions about the real world,
and it isn't clear that in these examples you mean to assert that the
different representations can't use the same logical language.
