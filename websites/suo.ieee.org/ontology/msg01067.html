============================================
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I need to say that I mean "eliminating variables"
&gt; in the sense of "explaining them away", in other words,
&gt; more like "taking them off the list of basic concepts".

MW: Precisely, if you can explain them away, then you know they 
are OK, without having worry about what they are.
&gt; 
&gt; My particular worries here, to the extent that I can even remember
&gt; what they were all about from twenty or thirty years down the line --
&gt; though I do recall the appropriation of various phrases that I had
&gt; probably learned in numerous other contexts, where I described the
&gt; core feeling as "ontological insecurity" or a "semantic equivalent
&gt; of free-floating anxiety" -- but I think that all of that business
&gt; just meant that, whenever it came to "abstract algebraic subjects"
&gt; as abiding over and above "concrete arithmetic subjects", I simply
&gt; had no determinate sense of what all the equations and expressions
&gt; and formulas were ever supposed to be denoting, in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; So I am not exactly sure how to come up with a less abstract example,
&gt; as the whole problem only came up in the relatively abstract domains
&gt; of algebra and what we were once accustomed to call "symbolic logic",
&gt; as if it were some brand of purely and thoroughly modern methodology.
&gt; 
&gt; The satisfaction that arises from finding a relatively 
&gt; concrete denotation
&gt; for "open expresions", "patterns", "schemata", "templates", 
&gt; or whatever you
&gt; want to call them, whether in algebra or in logic, is simply 
&gt; the feeling of
&gt; being able to point to a definite "meaning", in the sense of 
&gt; an extensional
&gt; reference that abides, moderately contentedly, in the realm 
&gt; of instantiated,
&gt; constant-saturated expressions, each of which has, if 
&gt; evaluated, a constant
&gt; value in some ordinary domain of "arithmetic" values, say 
&gt; booleans or reals.
&gt; 
&gt; The sense in which one is successfully "explaining variables away"
&gt; is just this, that one comes to regard them as incidental devices
&gt; for getting down to the actual references of the open expressions.
&gt; 
&gt; This is and ought to be a fairly unsurprising solution to the
&gt; worry about variables, but it does involve a subtly different
&gt; attitude toward the subject matter than any of the approaches
&gt; I had previously taken up, as it takes regarding the level of
&gt; signs or syntactic entities, for instance, the above sorts of
&gt; constant expressions, as a distinct reality or real dimension
&gt; in and of itself.  And treating these significant expressions
&gt; as significant in their own right, not simply as something to
&gt; be cashed out as quickly as possible for the indicated values,
&gt; this marks the first stirring of a sign-theoretic sensibility.
&gt; It also means that one has to regard a whole set of instances,
&gt; not just a few of them, as being the real bearer of the sense.

MW: So variables are signs that refer to more than just one thing?
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of sense -- did this make any at all?

MW: Really quite clear - thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
