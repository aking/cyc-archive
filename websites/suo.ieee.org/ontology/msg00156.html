David,

I do not find your comment naive at all. Optimism, however I think, we need
in large quantities to deal with a mammoth size of this project. We have to
assume it is not an impossible mission and with a little perseverance, or a
lot is more likely, and few iterations we will succeed in laying out a
successful, and much needed framework for Standard Upper Ontology. 

I would like to quote Chris Partridge, from today's e-mail RE: SUO: RE: More
KIF-ified Ontology Content, who describes this process of iteration in the
following words: 
" As theories become richer, they become more interconnected. For example,
Aristotelian physics compartmentalized sub-lunary and super-lunary gravity.
Newtonian physics integrated them - so in both areas all three of Newton's
laws apply. So there is a trade-off between richness and
compartmentalization."


Optimistically yours

&gt; &gt; &gt; What worries me is that some of the pragmatic enthusiasts of
&gt; &gt; &gt; standardization have a very oversimplified vision of what the
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems are, and that they therefore are being led (or allowed) to
&gt; &gt; &gt; expect a lot more from the SUO than it can possibly deliver to them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If someone thinks of this as being like the choice of a standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; book-cataloging scheme, or a standard math notation, or a standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; paper size, then they really havnt understood what ontologies *are*.

&gt; &gt; MW:  I think this is the real concern.  I think you are right 
&gt; &gt; that some people here think we are going to make progress relatively
&gt; &gt; quickly (a year or two).  Whilst I hope we will achieve something in
&gt; &gt; a couple of years, the most likely result in that timescale is a 
&gt; &gt; better understanding of the size of problem we face.

&gt; Yes! 
&gt; You are right, Sir!  &lt;David Letterman doing Ed MacMahon voice&gt;
&gt; Say G'night E-verbody!  Drive Safely!

At the risk of sounding naive, and even optimistic, I would like to
suggest that if the only thing you see us accomplishing in the next
two years is to know that this is a huge project, perhaps we can cut short
the next two years worth of work and just agree right now that it is
big, really BIG, as well as hard, really HARD.

Unfortunately, in my mind, this doesn't get us much closer to our goal.
There are many people who take on large tasks, knowing they are large.
There are plenty of others who see how large a task is, and choose not 
to do it.  It is rare to find those who choose not to take on a task 
helping those who think it worthwhile.

I assume that anyone who is sending mail to this mailing list,
is interested in the existence of a Standard Upper Ontology.
The task is going backward from the goal to the actions necessary
to bring it into existence.
