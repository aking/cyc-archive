&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you want to put a label on me, then I think extensionalist
&gt; &gt; is probably your best bet. What I mean by this is taking as an
&gt; &gt; identity criteria for things, that any two things with the same
&gt; &gt; extension are the same thing. (It might be more proper to say
&gt; &gt; that there are not two (or more) things with the same extension).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The world then divides neatly into two basic sorts, sets
&gt; &gt; (including relations) and individuals (or particulars if
&gt; &gt; you prefer) where individuals are things that have an
&gt; &gt; extension in space time, and sets are things that
&gt; &gt; have members.

The terms "individual" and "particular" are not synonyms in classical logic.
A "particular" is that of which we can have enough information to say we know.
An "individual" is that of which we can only imagine having the power to grasp.

&gt; That rules out the empty set.  Also, I'm not sure it's wise to equivocate
&gt; on "extension" as you do:  the extension of an individual for you is (I take it)
&gt; something like a 4D chunk of space-time, while the extension of a set is the set
&gt; of its members (i.e., the set itself).  Granted, for you, both types of extension
&gt; are used to individuate objects of the relevant sort, but to avoid confusion perhaps
&gt; it's better to talk instead about, e.g., the spatio-temporal *extent* or *boundaries*
&gt; (or the like) of an individual, rather than its extension.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One thing to note about this position is that any piece of
&gt; &gt; space time is an individual, just as any collection of things
&gt; &gt; is a set.

Not sure exactly, but Matthew appears to be using the term "extension"
along the lines of a fairly established tradition, much in the manner
that Descates did, not that's its any recommendation to a Peircean,
but I think, on balance, that this is probably one of life's little
ambiguities and/or equivocations with which we are just plain stuck.

&gt; To say this, you need to make sure that your underlying set theory
&gt; doesn't yield the existence of proper classes, which are collections
&gt; that are *not* sets.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; POSSIBLE WORLDS
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One of the key challenges for any viewpoint is how to model what
&gt; &gt; could be (past present and future), as well as what is/has been.
&gt; &gt; This is done using a "possible worlds" approach, or more properly
&gt; &gt; possible universes, in which spatio-temporal parts can be shared
&gt; &gt; between different possible universes.  So my life up to today
&gt; &gt; can be part of any possible future I might have.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A consequence of this (I believe) is that modal logic
&gt; &gt; is not required.
&gt; 
&gt; That's true -- one can express the usual semantics of modal languages
&gt; in a nonmodal language by quantifying directly over possible worlds
&gt; and possible individuals.

Something about a man, a plan, and green fan?

&gt; &gt; So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction
&gt; &gt; if I am not) the key constructs in KIF are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - constants
&gt; &gt;  - variables (and more generally lambda calculus)
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, there is no variety of lambda calculus in KIF.
&gt; (And I am puzzled why you think the lambda calculus
&gt; is a generalization of the notion of a variable.)

Lambda Calculus was devised to embody a rigorous theory for the
previously informal notions about variables as substitution sites
in expressions, that is, a theory of abstraction and application
of formulae.  Any other formal theory of the same subject matter,
like Combinator Calculus, no matter what you may call it, will
have to deal with pretty much the same issues, consciously and
deliberately, or otherwise.  What else are variables for?

Have to break away --

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - predication
&gt; &gt;  - relation
&gt; &gt;  - some basic elements of logic
&gt; 
&gt; Well, this list (including the two elements above) sort of mooshes
&gt; together syntactic, semantic, and logical issues. The syntax, semantics,
&gt; and logic of KIF should be clearly expressed in the KIF spec forthcoming
&gt; Real Soon Now from the KIF working group.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The question is how do you choose to use these.
&gt; &gt; The only thing that is certain is that if you
&gt; &gt; are not consistent you will store up trouble
&gt; &gt; for yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; Not much content there that one couldn't deduce a priori!  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The choices I make are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - classes and individuals map to constants
&gt; 
&gt; I.e., both classes (sets?) and individuals are
&gt; in the domain of quantification (and, I take it,
&gt; your quantification theory is first-order).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - predication is used for set membership.
&gt; 
&gt; You mean you model predication in terms of set membership
&gt; in the usual way?  Ok.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - how one individual stands to another is modelled by relation
&gt; &gt;    instances
&gt; 
&gt; You mean you model one thing x standing in relation R to another thing y
&gt; by including the pair &lt;x,y&gt; in the set that represents (or, is identical
&gt; with) R (again, in the usual way)?  Ok.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    note: only binary relations are used.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems bizarre to me to limit oneself in principle to binary relations.
&gt; Giving, for example, is a very natural 3-place relation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    This is principally to minimise structural constraints
&gt; &gt;    where all places in a relation must be filled,
&gt; &gt;    when some are not known.
&gt; 
&gt; This makes no sense to me whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - lambda calculus is used for defining constraints.
&gt; 
&gt; There are two major varieties of lambda calculus -- typed and untyped --
&gt; and I don't see that either is needed, or even usable, for ontology.
&gt; The typed lambda calculus is basically just omega-order logic (i.e.,
&gt; roughly, there are in its intended semantics objects of every finite
&gt; order, and, in its language, variables that range over each order),
&gt; which takes us far beyond the expressiveness of first-order logic,
&gt; as well as the somewhat more expressive (proposed) extension of KIF
&gt; attained by the addition of row variables.  I had thought you wanted
&gt; to use a first-order framework.
&gt; 
&gt; The untyped lambda calculus (developed in by Church and Kleene in the 30s)
&gt; is an approach to computability theory (though, notably, has also been used
&gt; more recently in the semantics of natural language as the basis of a theory
&gt; of properties and relations).  The untyped calculus, while powerful and flexible,
&gt; is also mathematically very complex, and I haven't seen anything in ontology that
&gt; requires it.  Perhaps if you said what a "constraint" is.  Are you simply talking
&gt; about the ability to define a class or relation by means of some condition like
&gt; "x is red and x is an apple"?  That only requires a reasonable class theory.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;     In general these indicate how a member of one class must stand in
&gt; &gt;     respect to a member of another class.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see any connection between this statement and the lambda calculus.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; note:
&gt; &gt; relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are only allowed when the
&gt; &gt; nature of the constraint they define is defined by a lambda expression.
&gt; 
&gt; Relations don't define anything;  they are just (for you) sets of ordered pairs.
&gt; And it is looking more and more like a constraint is just a condition like the
&gt; one above.  I think you should leave "lambda" out of it!
&gt;
