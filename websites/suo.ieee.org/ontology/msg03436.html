To continue ...

Without insisting on strict determinism, we may say that the inquiry process is
lawful if there is any kind of informative relationship connecting the state of
cognitive discord at each time with the ensuing state transitions of the system.
Expressed in human terms, a difference between expectations and observations is
experienced as a surprise to be explained, a difference between intentions and
observations is experienced as a problem to be solved.  We begin to understand
a particular example of inquiry when we can describe the relation between the
momentary intellectual state of its agent and the subsequent action that the
agent undertakes.

These simple facts, the features of inquiry outlined above, already raise
a number of issues, some of which are open problems that my research will
have to address.  Given the goal of constructing supports for inquiry on
the grounds of systems theory, each of these difficulties is an obstacle
to progress in the chosen direction, to understanding the capacity for
inquiry as a systems property.  In the next few paragraphs I discuss
a critical problem to be solved in this approach, indicating its
character to the extent I can succeed at present, and I suggest
a reasonable way of proceeding.

In human inquiry there is always a relation between cognitive and affective
features of experience.  We have a sense of how much harmony or discord is
present in a situation, and we rely on the intensity of this sensation as
one measure of how to proceed with inquiry.  This works so automatically
that we have trouble distinguishing the affective and cognitive aspects
of the irritating doubt that drives the process.  In the artificial
systems we build to support inquiry, what measures can we take to
supply this sense or arrange a substitute for it?  If the proper
measure of doubt cannot be formalized, then all responsibility
for judging it will have to be assigned to the human side of
the interface.  This would greatly reduce the usefulness of
the projected software.

The unsettled state that instigates inquiry is characterized
by a high level of uncertainty.  The settled state of knowledge
at the end of inquiry is achieved by reducing this uncertainty to
a minimum.  Within the framework of information theory we have a
concept of uncertainty, the entropy of a probability distribution,
as being something we can measure.  Certainly, how we feel about
entropy does not enter the equation.  Can we form a connection
between the kind of doubt that drives human inquiry and the kind
of uncertainty that is measured on scales of information content?
If so, this would allow important dynamic properties of inquiry
driven systems to be studied in abstraction from the affective
qualities of the disagreements which drive them.  With respect
to measurable qualities of uncertainty, inquiry driven systems
could be taken as special types of control systems, where the
variable to be controlled is the total amount of discrepancy,
disparity, or dispersion in the knowledge base of the system.

The assumption of modularity, that the affective and the intellectual
aspects of inquiry can be disentangled into separate components of the
system, is a natural one to make.  Whenever it holds, even approximately,
it simplifies the task of understanding and permits the analyst or designer
to assign responsibility for these factors to independent modules of the
simulation or implementation.  However, this assumption appears to be
false in general, or true only in approaching certain properties of
inquiry.  Other features of inquiry are not completely understandable
on this basis.  To tackle these more refractory properties, I will be
forced to examine the concept of a measure that separates the affective
and intellectual impacts of disorder.  To the extent that this issue can
be resolved by analysis, I believe that it hinges on the characters that
make a measure objective, that is, invariant over many perspectives and
interpretations, as opposed to being merely the measure of a subjective
moment, an impression limited to a special interpretation or perspective.

The preceding discussion has indicated a few of the properties that are
attributed to inquiry and its agents, and has initiated an analysis of
their underlying principles.  Now we engage the task of giving these
processes operational definitions in the framework of mathematical
systems theory.

Let us consider the inquiry driven system as described by a set of variables:

x_1, ... , x_k, a_1, ... , a_m.

Here, the x_i, for i = 1 to k, are regarded as ordinary state variables
while the a_j, for j = 1 to m, are regarded as variables codifying the
state of knowledge with respect to a variety of issues.  Many of the
parameters a_j will simply echo or anticipate the transient features
of state that are swept out by the x_i variables.  However, in order
for the system to possess a knowledge base that takes a propositional
stance with respect to its own state space, other information variables
a_j will have to be utilized in less direct, that is, more symbolic ways.

The most general term that we can use to describe the informational parameters
a_j is to call them &quot;signs&quot;.  These are the syntactic building blocks that go
into constructing the various knowledge bases of the inquiry driven system.
Although these variables can be employed in a simple analogue fashion to
represent information about past, present, or prospective states of the
system, ultimately it becomes necessary for the system to have a formal
syntax of expressions in which logical propositions about states can be
represented and manipulated.  I have implemented one fairly efficient
way of doing this, using only three arbitrary symbols beyond the more
passive arrays that are used to echo the ordinary features of state.

A task that remains for future work is to operationalize a suitable
measure of difference between alternative propositions about the world,
that is, about the state space of the system.  A successful measure will
gauge the differences in objective models and not be overly sensitive to
unimportant variations in syntax.  This means that the first priority of
this measure is to recognize logical equivalence classes of expressions,
responding equally to each of their individual members.  This requirement
brings the investigation back within the fold of logical inquiry.  Along
with finding such a measure of difference I will have to specify how these
differences determine the state transitions of the inquiry driven system.
At this juncture a number of suggestive analogies arise, connecting the
logical, qualitative problem just stated with the questions treated in
differential geometry and geometric dynamics.

Trickster Treat!
