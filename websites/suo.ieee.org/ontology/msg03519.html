matthew, a few choice afterthoughts ...

JA = Jon Awbrey
MW = Matthew West

JA: Short answer:  To the extent that a concrete syntax for 
    FOL is built on the foundation of a concrete syntax for
    ZOL, and to the extent that the underlying concrete
    foundation is poured from the conglomerate mixer of
    PABloid logic, the entire superstructure of the
    logical edifice that is erected on this site
    will continue to rest -- if you can call
    that rest -- on the fault lines of
    a radically undermind neural plate 
    architectonics.  Furthermore, the
    PABlematic foundation presents
    a practical obstacle to
    constructing several
    other very useful,
    almost indispensable
    extensions to the basic
    infrastructure of ZOL, like
    the differential extension and
    the higher order propositional
    extension, which latter affords the
    mind with novel views on the vistas
    of a generalized quantificational logic.

MW: This boils down to FOL not being foundational enough
    for you, i.e. there is other stuff that it rests on.

JA: another reason to distrust short answers.
    and not really my strong point, anyway.
    so let me try to compound the fault.

JA: shorter answer:  no, i think everyone would agree
    that 1 is founded on 0.  but we are talking about
    numerals (the signs) not numbers (the objects),
    to unpack the metaphor, concrete formal languages
    or systems of syntax, or, returning to metaphor,
    we are trying to make comparisons among chinese,
    mayan, roman, arabic, binary, primes, and other
    systems of numerals, to ask which serves us better
    for a particular objective that we might name.

MW: So you are saying that as a matter of principle
    you need to be able to support different ways of
    representing a concept, because different ones are
    useful for different purposes? KIF is just one such,
    not all such.

JA: not sure.  more like this.  we are currently involved
    in a design task where we have to consider different
    ways of realizing an abstractly specified objective --
    notice that &quot;abstractly specified objective&quot; does
    not of necessity mean that the objective itself
    is abstract.  reverting to metaphor once again,
    let's say that we have to choose among several
    different concrete roads for getting to the
    real world locale to which the abstract
    symbol &quot;Dublin&quot; most commonly attaches
    and most frequently brings to most
    folks' minds.

JA: from a pragmatic perspective, languages are artifacts, implements,
    instru-mentalities, &quot;organs&quot; (in the original greek sense), that
    are designed to cover worlds of objectives.  in some cases the
    designer is nature's evolutionary geppetto, in some cases it's
    up to us.  if a thing is designed to a purpose, and if we are
    at all capable of thinking deliberately and rationally about
    design to a purpose -- instead of spending all of our time
    hiring fancy lawyers to write the disclaimers thereof --
    then it must be possible to compare different designs
    in regard to an object, and to ask if any of them
    are better or not.

JA: the question divides doubly at this point:

JA: 1.  intra-linguistic comparisons.

        a.  intra-linguistic comparisons in regard to one object.

        b.  intra-linguistic comparisons over a range of objects.

JA: 2.  inter-linguistic comparisons.

        a.  inter-linguistic comparisons in regard to one object.

        b.  inter-linguistic comparisons over a range of objects.

JA: notice that i speak &quot;in regard to&quot; (irt) objects, not concepts.
    that is not a slip, and it is not accidental.  in the pragmatic
    perspective -- actually the way that i'm using the term &quot;concept&quot;
    was the common understanding among educated folks until relatively
    recently, when a &quot;vast and growing literature of papers&quot; (vaglop)
    written by folks who are educated to disdain anything so basic
    in the way of actually practicing their espoused intellectual
    virtues as the simple doing of their homework has blown up --
    anyway, to a pragmatic thinker a &quot;concept&quot; is just a sign,
    and so a system of concepts is yet another language of
    the kind whereof we speak.

JA: ultimately, of course, we are interested in comparing whole systems of signs
    in regard to their differentially adaptive advantages and potentials, their
    &quot;fitness&quot;, to use the old evolutionary term, in the struggle to understand
    whole systems of existence, and thus, one would hope, to exist.

JA: &quot;let %b%!&quot;?  i will read it &quot;let peirce be peirce!&quot;.

i am going to make an effort from now on to criticisze kif
only for those features that are peculiar to kif or to the
kif-induced communities of (mis)interpretation and (ab)use.

that is why i introduced the name &quot;pentalphabet&quot; to denote the series of
logical symbols that commonly begins with the usual suspect gang of five:
&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ..., or any of the regional dialects thereof.

because this more generic issue is such a significant point --
not all of my acronyms are pointless! -- i will henceforth
leave off from kicking poor kif around and advert instead
to any form of logical system that takes this &quot;pab five&quot;
as the ostencile primitives of its sentential component
by placing one and all under the generic mark of &quot;pab&quot;.

no language is perfect, no language is sans criticism,
and no language can be apprized, criticized, evaluated,
probated, scathed, tested, unscathed, or whatever, but
in regard to a designated object, objective, or purpose.

what agon is proper to any concrete implement of zol, pab or not?
that is a good thing to think about.  i have myself thought away
many good years on it, but i do think that the question has been
discussed well enough in this, that, or the other forum for me
to be able to hazard a guess what others might say about it.

that in itself is a curious circumstance, but not the current business ...

so let us ask:  what is the object of logic?
in other wise:  what is the purpose of any logical language?

without even trying to give a complete answer to that,
i would be willing to venture, as i've always ventured,
that one object of logic is &quot;to denote objects&quot;, in the
many senses of the word &quot;object&quot;, in the objective world.

without even trying to say, just yet, how such an objective is possible,
let us take it for granted, for now, that such an objective is worthy,
and let us adopt it as one of our provisional objectives for logic.

if we now take the whole systems approach to this question,
roughly indicated in item 2b above, then we are led to ask:
what is the whole system of logical objects that we desire
to denote, in whole and in part, in general and in detail,
by means of the whole system of logical signs called &quot;zol&quot;,
or boolean algebra, or prop calc, or sent log, or whatever?

the answer to that happens to factor into a couple of parts:

1.  the object of zol is all there is.

2.  the object of zol is the set of boolean functions.

the point is that we use boolean functions of some type B^k -&gt; B
as an intermediate realm of &quot;transitional objects&quot; for describing
anything at all that we want to talk about, at least, to a limited
degree of approximation.

object 1 is the order of things that we need to leave open,
as open as any of us can possibly imagine how to let it be.

object 2 is the order of things that we have hope to close
our conceptual fists around, so it furthers to focus on it.

let us then call the intermediate object domain of zol, pab-based or otherwise,
by the independent name of &quot;zeroth order objects&quot; (zoo), a garden of boolean
functions that we may regard as being nicely sorted by types like B^k -&gt; B.

these contemplations bring us to the following consideration:
is it possible to make comparisons among different languages
for zol with regard to their differential practical adequacy
to represent the whole system of objects found in the zoo?

that is the brand of inquiry that i will carry forward here.
