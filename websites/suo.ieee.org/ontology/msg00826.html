&gt;Dear Pat, may I try to increase our mutual understanding?

By all means. I will try to correspond in kind.

&gt;My overall comment is that I believe the scope of the SUO requires us to
&gt;relate it in some way or other to the real world, whatever that may be,
&gt;else how does it ever get to be useful.  If you don't like the way I am
&gt;trying to do it, do have any alternative proposal?

This is a topic on which I have had many long debates (with John 
Sowa, among others), but I honestly do not think that we need to go 
beyond Tarski, most of the time. That is, the usual, boring, familiar 
mathematical model theory, which has been the 'standard' semantics 
for logic now for over half a century and is astonishingly 
well-understood, and is used throughout mathematics and formal logic 
(and is the basis on which the metatheory of logic such as 
completeness theorems, compactness theorems, etc., all rest), will do 
just fine to be the basis for how to connect our representations to 
the real world. This is not to say that it will solve all the 
philosophical problems or even all the technical problems, but only 
that it will serve as a perfectly functional theory as far as it 
goes, and moreover that for most of what we have to do that will be 
quite far enough. (The exceptions being perhaps where we need to 
consider an explicit ontology of signs and relate or connect that 
theory to our own logical language, if we ever get that far; and 
perhaps, though I am more sanguine than many of my colleagues about 
these problems, if we need to get deeply into questions of meaning in 
natural language. I personally will be happy to go to my grave 
without ever getting deeply involved in either of these topics, but 
others may have a different agenda, of course.)

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Pat, may I yet again suggest we can avoid a lot of problems if we are
&gt;clear
&gt; &gt;and consistent about whether we use any particular term to refer to the
&gt; &gt;real world or to a representation.
&gt;
&gt;By all means, but I wonder if you and I agree on quite what these
&gt;terms mean. I havn't been talking about representations at all;
&gt;relations are things in the semantics. (I do sometimes slip and
&gt;forget to say 'symbol' in 'relation symbol', mea culpa.)
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; I hope we could understand each other better if we could agree.  If I
&gt;suggest real world corresponds with Peirce's firstness, does this help you
&gt;understand what I mean?

Alas, no it does not. Let me confess to this list what many of my 
friends already know, which is that I find Peirce's writings and 
ideas about as opaque and unhelpful on these matters as, say, the 
Kabbalah. I have absolutely no idea what 'Nthness' means, for any N, 
and I wish, with the utmost sincerity and from the bottom of my 
heart, that everyone who wishes to promote or prosleytise Peircian 
numerological ideas would go away to an island somewhere, preferably 
one without internet access.

(All of which, let me hasten to add, is not meant to in any way 
denigrate the historical importance of this great and undeservedly 
neglected American philosopher, who was so far in advance of his 
brutish European contemporaries and whose reputation has been 
maligned and distorted by an evil conspiracy - left or right wing, Im 
not sure which - for so long. Much of his thinking has been unduly 
neglected, including his brilliant, if flawed, metaphor between 
logical variables and chemical valency - just imagine what Peirce 
would have done with quantum electrodynamics! - and his remarkable 
theory of the logical meaning of colors, among which he includes the 
traditional heraldic classifications including gold, silver and 
fox-fur. Now, can we get on with something more useful?)

&gt; If so, what would you call secondness or
&gt;thirdness?

I wouldn't. When we get to numerology, I will leave the room and go 
find a bar somewhere.

&gt;It would also help me if you could clarify what you mean by
&gt;"things in the semantics"; in particular the semantics of what.

Well, of the language in which we propose to write the SUO. (Isn't 
that what this is all about?) I tend to use KIF, but I don't have 
strong views about it.

&gt; &gt;In particular I use the word relation only to refer to a representation of
&gt; &gt;the real world, and in conformity with Ted Codd's definition.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; Perhaps I should have used two separate sentences here.  I did not mean
&gt;Ted Codd defined relation to be a representation of the real world.  In
&gt;fact, he defined it much as you do below.  He (and I) then applied the
&gt;concept as a way of representing things.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not familiar with Ted Codd's work, but this isnt the sense in
&gt;which the term is used throughout mathematics and philosophy, and I'm
&gt;afraid that I would find it impossible to adapt to this usage.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; See above and below.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;As such, I
&gt; &gt;see no problem in it only being a table of surrogates.  Conversely I use
&gt; &gt;the word relationship only to refer to the thing in the real world made up
&gt; &gt;of arbitrary entites.
&gt;
&gt;I am not sure quite what y'all consider to be "in the real world"
&gt;here. There is a very good sense in which the actual world consists
&gt;of nothing but stuff arranged in space and time, for example. Sorry
&gt;if I seem to be very academic and persnickety, but I tend to agree
&gt;with John Sowa that talk about what is 'real' is rather dangerous in
&gt;these contexts. I really do not know whether sets are 'real' in the
&gt;sense that, say, my desk is. They certainly arent *physically* real.
&gt;But I don't really care, either; my point about 'surrogates' is just
&gt;that sets can be sets of anything. The real things are the things in
&gt;the sets, not the sets themselves.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; It seems to me that the scope of the SUO requires us to relate it in
&gt;some way or other to the real world, whatever that may be, else how does it
&gt;ever get to be useful.  If you don't like the way I am trying to do it, do
&gt;have any alternative proposal?

See above and end. Basically I don't think it is something that needs 
to be done in any special way; I think it will come out in the wash, 
as my grandmother used to say.

&gt; &gt;In my experience, every relationship in the real world of whatever
&gt; &gt;arbitrary entities can be adequately represented using one or more
&gt; &gt;relations with suitable surrogates in its columns.
&gt;
&gt;Well now, that is obviously wrong. There are certainly relations that
&gt;cannot be represented using tables of surrogates: for example, the
&gt;property of being an uncomputable number, or indeed *any* interesting
&gt;arithmetic relation (such as addition). But more concretely, consider
&gt;the fact that there are galaxies we can see but we cannot see any of
&gt;the stars in them, and consider the relation (in the real, real
&gt;world) of being a star in a galaxy. You can't adequately represent
&gt;that one with a table of surrogates since we havnt got any surrogates
&gt;for all those invisible stars.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; It all depends on how we define relationship (which you agree below is
&gt;not defined in mathematics in the way relation is).  If I have identified a
&gt;particular star, and I have identified a particular galaxy, and I have
&gt;evidence that that star is in that galaxy, I call that an instance of a
&gt;relationship in the real world that I would like to represent in some way
&gt;in a model.

Sure. But what about if you havn't identified a particular star, and 
moreover couldn't in principle? You might still want to say something 
about the relation between stars and galaxies - for example, you 
might want to say that every visible galaxy contains millions of 
stars which are invisible (with the telescopes currently available). 
That is a perfectly reasonable thing to be able to assert - it 
happens to be true, and indeed is an important fact in any 
understanding of astrophysics or astronomy. But it cannot be 
represented as a fact about tables of surrogates.

The general point is that the sets of n-tuples which we want to allow 
in our semantics will usually have to be a larger collection than the 
sets of tables of surrogates which we could possibly store in a 
database. We need to be able to say things about realities which we 
could not possibly tabulate. Ontologies are more than just data 
models for databases. They have to be able to talk about the world, 
even those parts of it which can't be tabulated.

&gt; I believe asserting the existance of a tuple in a relation (or
&gt;adding a row to a table) is a good way to do this.  This may be useful
&gt;however many other stars, galaxies, and relationships between them may or
&gt;may not exist or be represented by other tuples.  I think your examples
&gt;(especially addition) are precisely why using the mathematical term
&gt;relation as if it were a synonym for relationship as used in natural
&gt;language to describe real world situations leads to high risk of confusion.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Does this help?
&gt;
&gt;Er...I didnt feel like I needed any help on this particular topic. A
&gt;relation is a set of tuples. Relations have been sets of tuples since
&gt;I was an undergraduate math major, and they will go on being sets of
&gt;tuples. Its hard to think of anything clearer than that.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; Your definition of relation is the way Ted Codd used it and I agree
&gt;with. I am, and in this context I believe Ted Codd is, an applied
&gt;mathematician. That is, having some established mathematical results, we
&gt;seek to apply them to some real problem.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Incidently, while I agree that the word relation is well defined in
&gt; &gt;symbolic logic and relational databases, I am not aware of the same being
&gt; &gt;true of the word relationship.
&gt;
&gt;No, it isn't, you are right. I will avoid using it for just that
&gt;reason, in fact.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; Please carry on preferring relation when what you are talking about is
&gt;the mathematical concept.  Please also consider if some different (and not
&gt;necessarily precisely defined) word like relationship is more appropriate
&gt;when you are trying to refer explicitly to things like stars, galaxies, and
&gt;other observable phenomena.

No, I won't, because I profoundly disagree with your philosophical 
assumptions here. Allow me to explain.

There is a widespread assumption about the 'meaning' of mathematics 
which might be called 'naive platonism': the idea that mathematical 
language is about a world of abstract mathematical 'things' which are 
essentially different from the things in the real, physical world. On 
this view, whenever we use 'formal' or mathematical concepts, we must 
be referring to this abstract world, so therefore cannot be referring 
to anything in the real world. To apply such mathematical talk to the 
real world therefore, on this view, requires yet another interpretive 
step to relate this abstract platonic world to the concerete, 
physical, world.

Now, I think this view is just plain wrong. When I use mathematical 
language to talk about the world (as for example when I say that a 
piece of wood is ten inches long), I am actually talking about the 
things in the world, not about abstractions that need to be somehow 
related to the world by yet another theory of representations. As I 
said in my comments (about a week ago) on Niles' revised upper 
ontology, when a shepherd counts his sheep he isnt saying anything 
about an abstract world of numbers: he is counting *sheep*.  When I 
talk about sets of things, I mean exactly that: sets of *things*. 
Things like sheep, for example. And this works even in more complex 
areas of mathematics. Algebra texts often say things like 'an example 
of the Klein group is provided by the rotations and flips of a 
rectangular card'. This is couched in typical mathematician's 
naive-platonist language ("the Klein group") , but what it really 
means is that those (physical) rotations and flips of a (physical) 
card provide a model - a valid interpretation - of the Klein group 
axioms. Similarly, when I say that a relation is a set of n-tuples, I 
do NOT mean to imply that a relation is some kind of ethereal 
abstraction completely removed from the real, physical, world. It may 
be - one can have relations on abstract things - but also might not 
be, since one can also have relations - in exactly the same sense - 
on concrete things. For example, consider the relation of owning. 
Among the pairs in that set are the one containing me and a certain 
Ford pickup truck (the grey one in the car park outside this 
building.) I really do mean me, the physical person, and my physical 
truck. Not datastructures or surrogates or entries in a table or 
'mathematical objects', but  two real, physical things. (In case you 
are going to ask: but is the *pair* a physical thing? I don't know, 
and I don't care. I'm not making any ontological claims about the 
pair, only about the things it pairs.)

So, to sum up, I will not use a different term for an 'abstract' 
relation and a real, in-yer-actual-world relation(ship), because I 
don't think these are fundamentally distinct. They are both sets of 
n-tuples; the only difference is the physical character of the things 
in those n-tuples. In brief: 'mathematical objects' may well contain 
'things like stars, galaxies, and other observable phenomena'.

(And, I might add, that while we can argue about this until the cows 
come home, this is the view that is embedded in the basic model 
theory of virtually every logical language ever studied, so if SUO is 
going to use any kind of extensional logic, then it had better either 
adopt this view or get busy rewriting a large part of 20th century 
formal logic. I would recommend the former, if only to get a head 
start on the competition.)

I can see that if you don't accept this view, then you will have a 
hard time following what I say. I'm not sure what to suggest to 
alleviate this problem, but one strategy might be for you to take 
everything I say with a grain of salt. I think I'm talking about the 
real world, but you think (maybe) that I'm suffering from a delusion, 
and that I'm really only talking about a kind of Platonic shadow of 
the *real* real world.  If that is more or less right, then interpret 
my position as that of being quite happy to be only talking about 
shadows.
