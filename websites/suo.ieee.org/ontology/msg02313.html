   I'm not at all sure that discussion of the "heap" paradox
per se is useful to advancement of the SUO, though I think that
the issue of granularity, especially as pertains to "stuff-like"
substances, connectedness,  and measurement is a critical 
related issue that should be discussed carefully at 
the earliest possible time.
   However, if anyone is interested in the sorites paradox,
there is still something more to say, interspersed below.

&gt; &gt;   Concerning contextualization and the heap paradox:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[Pat Cassidy]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   I can imagine using such precise limits in definitions [like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;heap and grain] as being problematic only in some rare cases of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;language understanding, but since multiple reiterative processes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;are seldom referred to in normal language, I suspect that using
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a limit will work in just about every practical situation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, come ON!  Engineers and practical folk have to reason about
&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple repetition all the time. Ask a blacksmith. Think of issues
&gt; &gt; &gt; of rate of wear of machine parts. Even biologists have to think about
&gt; &gt; &gt; cumulative error rates in DNA replication.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   Yes, I left out the implied qualifier in the phrase, it should
&gt; &gt;have been: "multiple reiterative processes **involving vague
&gt; &gt;concepts like a heap** . . .".  The types of physical reiterative
&gt; &gt;processes you mention present no problem because the systems
&gt; &gt;are among those "just about every practical situation" where
&gt; &gt;making vague concepts precise is beneficial.
&gt; 
&gt; I deeply disagree. If you read almost any technical manual, listen to
&gt; the ways people talk when teaching each other, and so on, you will
&gt; find 'vague' concepts. In fact I would go so far as to claim that
&gt; virtually *all* the concepts that people use in ordinary everyday
&gt; discourse are 'vague' in this sense. Concepts like 'person' and
&gt; 'bowl' and 'board' and 'table' don't have sharp definitional
&gt; boundaries. People even use small integers in 'vague' ways, as when a
&gt; recipe calls for '3 or 4  grains of salt', and it doesnt really
&gt; matter if you put in, say, 5, but it does matter if you put in 5000.
&gt; 

   I completely agree that people use vague concepts in language,
and often do so intentionally.   But it seems the comments above
are drifting very far from the question of how vagueness affects the
heap paradox, and how to formalize it.  I believe that there are
many vague concepts that can be formalized without paradoxes like
that of the heap.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems quite obvious to me both that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; antecedents of the paradox are correct - heaps are finite, may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; large, and removing a single grain from a large heap never, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself, makes a large heap small  - and that the conclusion is
&gt; &gt; &gt; absurd, and yet that the reasoning has no obvious flaws in it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I think it's clear that both can't be correct if both heap and
&gt; &gt;grain have unchanging definitions.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I insist. Stop being an engineer or a logician for a second and
&gt; imagine you are a kid again. Isnt is just *obvious* that heaps can be
&gt; large and can consist of humungous numbers of small grains, that
&gt; taking just one grain away is never going to make a large heap not
&gt; large, yet taking enough of them away will eventually do it. And that
&gt; combination of facts isn't at all puzzling or mysterious: its just
&gt; part of what we know about things like large heaps, part of what we
&gt; know about the world; it is kind of obvious. The fact that one can
&gt; derive a contradiction when this obvious thing is formalized suggests
&gt; to me that there is something wrong with the formalization, not that
&gt; there is anything wrong with the intuitions.
&gt; 
   Yes, yes.  The intuition is correct, but it is correct only because 
it is true of a *single* instance of removal of a grain from a heap,
and multiple iterations are not part of the intuition.
  In effect the intiuition is that 
     "take 1 grain from a big pile, and you still have a pile"
   And though people may use he same word "pile" to refer to the
big pile and the resulting pile, no one thinks that 
the original pile hasn't changed in the process of removing one grain.

    The paradox arises only because philosophers have decided to 
consider the result of iterative application of the original intuition,
and falsely equate the resulting pile with the starting pile, which
is not part of the normal intuition, regardless of how it may be 
expressed in vague linguistic terms.

   The formalized statement is false because thus taken out of context 
it is effectively a mathematical equation:
  heap - 1 = heap
  and if "heap" remains unchanged on both sides of the equaiton,
the result is that 1 = 0.

   So, yes, there is something wrong with the formalization,
in that it does not accurately reflect the normal intuition.

    The only formalization that I can think of that allows
reiteration requires that the grain size change -- but that is,
as you point out, not physically realistic, as grains do have
a minimum size. So formalization of the reiterative process 
with a single definition of "heap" is impossible (any attempt
results in an untrue statement), and formalization of the 
intuition must require that the resulting pile be different from 
the starting pile, regardless of whether at early iterations 
it might be possible to refer to the starting and resulting piles 
by the same linguistic term. (e.g. a "big pile" is a subtype of
"pile" and could be referred to as a "pile".)  So it is
possible to say that removing one grain from a pile leaves a pile,
but it is only true if the meaning of the first "pile" is
in fact "big pile" -- a formalization must disambiguate the
meanings of the first and second "pile" terms, which must be different
for the formaization to be true.


&gt; &gt;[Pat Cassidy]
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  "large" is very dependent on context,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and might need many different definitions depending on context.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; &gt; But then that begs the question. If truths can be dependent on
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'context' then we can just say that 'large heap' depends on context.
&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you cash out this contextuality in axioms?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   We can't avoid the contextuality of natural language; ignoring
&gt; &gt;*that* would be begging the central question of natural
&gt; &gt;language understanding. . . .
&gt; 
&gt; Who said we were doing natural language understanding? I certainly am
&gt; not, and I suspect most of the ontology effort is not devoted to
&gt; doing so. I do not regard NL as central to ontology design: on the
&gt; contrary, to make the connection is actively misleading, in my view.
&gt; . . .
    If the SUO is not sufficiently general to be useful as
the most fundamental set of concepts for NLU as well as other
applications, then it will be very much less useful than it can
be.  Natural Language Understanding is one of the potential
applications mentioned in the original statement of purpose.
I did not notice that it has been deleted from the list of goals
for the SUO.  I believe that a mechanism for including context in 
definitions is essential for NLU, and thus for the SUO.
