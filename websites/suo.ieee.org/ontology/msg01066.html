&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Are sets abstract?
&gt; 
&gt; I think there is some talking at cross purposes going on here.

MW: It sounds like it.
&gt; 
&gt; My original question was what makes something abstract - what 
&gt; is the basis
&gt; for the abstract/concrete distinction (as there seem to be a number of
&gt; possibilities). A standard answer (in some communities) with a long
&gt; tradition is that abstract things do not have spatio-temporal 
&gt; location - and
&gt; concrete things do. Pat suggested that sets were abstract (a 
&gt; position you
&gt; hold - from what you say below). Pat, I seem to recall, 
&gt; claimed that sets
&gt; were abstract because they could not have spatio-temporal 
&gt; location (sorry if
&gt; I have remembered incorrectly Pat). In other words, his 
&gt; 'definition ' of
&gt; abstract was 'having spatio-temporal location'. My point was that some
&gt; people (me and you included) are comfortable with regarding 
&gt; some sets as
&gt; having a spatio-temporal location. 

MW: I'm not sure its appropriate to count me in. I agree there are 
classes that have properties that indicate spatio-temporal location,
but that doesn't mean I think the class has a spatio-temporal location,
it is the members of the class that share a spatio-temporal location 
as a common property.

&gt; So for you and I the claims that
&gt; 'abstract means not having spatio-temporal location' and 'sets are
&gt; abstract' - are inconsistent. This is my original point.
&gt; 
&gt; As you do not hold to the first claim ('abstract means not having
&gt; spatio-temporal location') you can make the second claim ('sets are
&gt; abstract') without being inconsistent. But this leaves us 
&gt; without a notion
&gt; of what your idea of abstract is. Perhaps you can elaborate. 
&gt; A common claim
&gt; is that sets are by definition abstract (and sometimes (if one is a
&gt; materialist) that only sets are abstract) - in this case the two terms
&gt; collapse into one another.

MW: Well this would also be true for me. All abstract things are classes.
&gt; 
&gt; One place among many to look for a discussion of these 
&gt; problems is David
&gt; Lewis's on the Plurality of Worlds  - pp. 81-86 Concreteness.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Groups and Collections.
&gt; 
&gt; Again I think we are talking at cross purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; You say:
&gt; What I think you are doing is asking whether, given the one-to-one
&gt; relationship, is it not possible to merge the two objects?
&gt; 
&gt; My point was not that one could merge the notion of set and collection
&gt; (though some mereologists have tried this route).
&gt; My point was rather that one could have a third notion - of a 
&gt; group - with
&gt; its own way of working.

MW: What way is there between transitive and intransitive? But I guess you
can define some other behaviour, but I understood the range was relatively
limited.
&gt; 
&gt; To return to my question:
&gt; &gt; As you say, in different circumstances one might want to use
&gt; &gt; the set and the
&gt; &gt; fusion approach. However, what happens if you want to use
&gt; &gt; them both in the
&gt; &gt; same situation - or is this just impossible (as you seem to
&gt; &gt; suggest) and if
&gt; &gt; so why?
&gt; And my example:
&gt; &gt; There are examples where we appear to be using both
&gt; &gt; approaches. One of the
&gt; &gt; useful properties of sets (as Frege noticed) was that one can
&gt; &gt; count their
&gt; &gt; members. So if I say 'those two hundred bolts weigh 2 kilo'.
&gt; &gt; Or, that 'there
&gt; &gt; are around 500 nuts in that 10 kilo'. How do we explain this?
&gt; &gt; That we are
&gt; &gt; talking about two closely related things, the fusion and the
&gt; &gt; set? This is
&gt; &gt; possible but requires more work to explain than the surface
&gt; &gt; structure of the
&gt; &gt; phrases suggest.
&gt; 
&gt; I presume you would analyse each of these as two statements about two
&gt; different but intimately related things:
&gt; So 'those two hundred bolts weigh 2 kilo' is really saying - 
&gt; that class of
&gt; bolts has 200 members and the fusion of the members weighs 2 
&gt; kilo. So your
&gt; (our) approach involves some unpacking (revising) of the 
&gt; surface structure
&gt; of the sentence. The sentence seems to be talking about one 
&gt; thing with two
&gt; properties - but is really talking about two related things 
&gt; each with one
&gt; property. And you would say that one of these things is 
&gt; abstract, the other
&gt; concrete.

MW: Correct.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: this approach suggests that some properties are 
&gt; typically (always)
&gt; properties of individual and others of classes - a useful piece of
&gt; knowledge, if true (or if possible to believe consistently).

MW: Yes. Classes seem to me to have very few properties of their own. Count
is one of the few. Perhaps more interesting is the assertion that only sets
can have a count.
&gt; 
&gt; As you note:
&gt; &gt;MW: It is impossible because one is transitive and teh other 
&gt; transitive. So
&gt; &gt;it is OK to use each for different puposes, but not one for 
&gt; both purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; It is impossible (or maybe just very difficult) to get an 
&gt; interpretation of
&gt; the examples that respects the surface structure using just 
&gt; fusion (part)
&gt; and set (member).
&gt; 
&gt; But his does not mean it is impossible to come up with some 
&gt; interpretation
&gt; that respects the surface structure.
&gt; 
&gt; We said:
&gt; &gt; I think it would be difficult to prove option 3 is
&gt; &gt; inconsistent - what is at
&gt; &gt; issue is cost and benefits.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: OK, then is Option 3 transitive or intransitive?
&gt; 
&gt; CP: Part and group-member are transitive but the combination 
&gt; of them (the
&gt; union of their relation classes) part-group-member is not, neither is
&gt; class-member - as explained below.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the passage quoted, I mean *some* characteristics of both
&gt; &gt; - a sort of
&gt; &gt; middle way. Maybe it would work something like this. Groups
&gt; &gt; of groups would
&gt; &gt; share members in much the same was as super and sub sets do.
&gt; &gt; The National
&gt; &gt; Gallery Art Collection could be considered as a collection of the
&gt; &gt; collections that have been donated, along with stuff it
&gt; &gt; acquired itself. One
&gt; &gt; of the collections (the Wallace Collection?) would have a
&gt; &gt; painting as a
&gt; &gt; group-member, which would also be a group-member of the
&gt; &gt; overall work of
&gt; &gt; National Gallery Art Collection. So group-member is transitive - but
&gt; &gt; different from part. So a part of a group-member would not be a
&gt; &gt; group-member. We now need to tell a story about whether we
&gt; &gt; can have sets of
&gt; &gt; groups or, indeed, groups of sets.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note: under this scheme we can give an interpretation of the
&gt; &gt; nuts and bolts
&gt; &gt; examples above that respects the surface structure of the phrases.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Under this scheme - the group of 200 bolts (in the example) is a third
&gt; object (existing along with the fusion and the class) which 
&gt; behaves like a
&gt; physical object in having a weight (200 kilo) but also like a class in
&gt; having a specific number of members. So we can respect the 
&gt; surface structure
&gt; of the sentence - X is the group of 200 bolts, it has the 
&gt; property of having
&gt; 200 members and the property of weighing 200 kilo. We are 
&gt; trading in ontic
&gt; economy for the ability to be able to respect the surface 
&gt; structure of the
&gt; description - and have a thing that can have properties that we have
&gt; previously specified as belonging to disjoint categories.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that you are burdening your notion of fusion 
&gt; with too much -

MW: I don't follow this conclusion. I am using two very simple
concepts that will be there anyway, rather than creating some
third concept that will be inevitably relatively complex.

&gt; to return to my example:
&gt; &gt; I am a little unhappy with your explanation of fusion.
&gt; &gt; You say:
&gt; &gt; MW: A fusion is some unordered aggregate of members of some
&gt; &gt; "atomic" object
&gt; &gt; type. So for example, a glass of water is a fusion of water
&gt; &gt; molecules. Water
&gt; &gt; molecule is the "atomic" level. What this means is that for
&gt; &gt; any aggregate
&gt; &gt; above the molcular level, the fusion is transitive. When you
&gt; &gt; go below the
&gt; &gt; molecular level, there is a whole part relation, but it is
&gt; &gt; assembly not
&gt; &gt; fusion. The atoms of each water molecule are assembled in
&gt; &gt; some sense into
&gt; &gt; molecules, not roaming around in some soup.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This implies that fusions have some notion of the 'atoms'
&gt; &gt; they are composed
&gt; &gt; of build into them. It seems to me that we can regard the
&gt; &gt; 'glass of water'
&gt; &gt; as a fusion of water molecules, a fusion of atoms or a fusion
&gt; &gt; of (what?)
&gt; &gt; superstings. We could also regard it as an extended piece 
&gt; of atomless
&gt; &gt; matter. In each case we are talking about the same thing (it
&gt; &gt; seems to me) -
&gt; &gt; but under a different 'mode of determination'.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You are merely indicating different atomic levels that 
&gt; you could choose.
&gt; the one chosen is usually indicated by the name of the 
&gt; fusion, so "a glass
&gt; of WATER" implies water molecules, "a team of PLAYERS" 
&gt; indicates that player
&gt; is the atomic level.
&gt; 
&gt; In ordinary language we say 'a glass of water' and we can 
&gt; also say for the
&gt; sake of the example 'glass of atoms' - then we seem to have 
&gt; three things -
&gt; the fusion (of water molecules of hydrogen and oxygen atoms), 
&gt; the set of
&gt; water molecules and the set of oxygen atoms.
&gt; 
&gt; So how do we identify the atoms for a fusion? You say 'the one [atomic
&gt; level] chosen is usually indicated by the name of the fusion' 
&gt; - but this is
&gt; a statement about the language not what the language is referring to.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that the fusion by itself has no natural atomic level -
&gt; whereas the sets do, their members (and the group/collection 
&gt; - if we were to
&gt; introduce it, also does). Do you agree?

MW: For me I am quite sure that fusion needs to have one or more atomic
level. 
You can choose the level. So when I look at a car park, and can choose if 
I am looking at a fusion of cars, or of car parts. (Since the fusion is one
spatio-temporal extent, then we are talking about one object that is both
a fusion of cars, and a fusion of car parts).

MW: Mmmm. I think I may have just shot myself in the foot.
&gt;

&gt; Chris
