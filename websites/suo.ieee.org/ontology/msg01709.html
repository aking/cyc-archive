Mike,
   I'd be happy to facilitate transfer of summaries to the web site.  When 
step 4 in your process is reached, I'd suggest that the author send me a 
message with a subject line like "Summary for web site posting".

&gt;Everyone,
&gt;
&gt;I have not been following the details of the triadicity discussion, but I was
&gt;delighted to see Pat Hayes' detailed explication of it. I'm guessing that 
&gt;it is
&gt;to a significant extent, a condensed and synthesized view of this thread so
&gt;far.  When this issue dies down, and there is reasonable agreement on things,
&gt;including what to disagree on, then it would be possible to record this as an
&gt;'official' outcome of the SUO group.
&gt;
&gt;I propose that a kind of SUO bookshelf be set up on our web pages. It would
&gt;contain detailed technical summaries similar to what Pat has produced. This
&gt;would be an
&gt;
&gt;      EFFECTIVE VEHICLE FOR DISSEMINATION OF THE
&gt;      SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE ON MANY FRONTS,
&gt;
&gt;which to date is virtually inaccessible, buried in the discussion archives.
&gt;One can think of this as real-time knowledge mining of our archives.
&gt;This would affect many folk:
&gt;
&gt;1. The world at large can see our progress to date.
&gt;2. Newcomers can much more easily get up to speed.
&gt;3. Regulars can skip the details and be assured of a good summary, in time.
&gt;4. All participants can be more efficient in the time they spend reading SUO,
&gt;    being able to keep up to speed on things on their own time, without fear
&gt;    of missing key information.
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I have on many occasions been on the verge of getting off this 
&gt;list
&gt;because it is overwhelming. Yet, there are MANY things that are of great
&gt;interest and relevance to me, which I lack the time to follow and 
&gt;contribute in
&gt;detail to.  A kind of SUO bookshelf, I hope would make everyone make more
&gt;efficient use of their SUO-time.
&gt;
&gt;I propose the following process/format for how this might happen.
&gt;
&gt;1. Discussion threads take place in the usual fashion.
&gt;
&gt;2. When things settle down a bit, and points of agreement are reached, these
&gt;should be summarized and fed back to the group. This would also include points
&gt;where people agree to disagree.
&gt;
&gt;3. When the main participants in the discussion reach agreement on the
&gt;summary, then it could be submitted to the overall group for placement
&gt;on the 'bookshelf'.   The assumption is that things DO go on the bookshelf.
&gt;I don't think we want a formal voting process for this. The idea of going to
&gt;the group at large, is to see if there are any further suggestions or
&gt;improvements to the document.
&gt;
&gt;4. We announce the existence of each new entry to the bookshelf to a SUO
&gt;interest group which is only intersted in the outcomes and timely 
&gt;announements,
&gt;rather than the day to day discussions.  We may already have such list, I do
&gt;not know whether the creation of SUO sub-lists some months ago, actually
&gt;worked.
&gt;
&gt;I would hope or expect that in many cases, these summaries could be the basis
&gt;for quality technical papers that are publishable.
&gt;
&gt;Can we submit a journal arcitle with SUO as author? :-)

&gt;
&gt;I know I said I wouldnt say any more on this topic here, but several
&gt;people have asked me for the review I mentioned, so here is a brief
&gt;summary of the pith and essence, shorn of references to Burch's
&gt;formalism and terminology.
&gt;
&gt;On irreducible triadicity.
&gt;
&gt;There are three distinct domains to consider. The first is a purely
&gt;mathematical notion of a connected graph; the second is formal
&gt;relational languages; and the third, somewhat murkier, is concerned
&gt;with the metaphysical nature of relations. Peirce proved a simple
&gt;result in graph theory to which he and others attribute metaphysical
&gt;significance; but it does so only if one chooses a particular
&gt;connection between the first and third of our domains via the second.
&gt;Other connections are possible, under which the result, while of
&gt;course still true, seems to have much less significance.
&gt;
&gt;The result in graph theory is, roughly, that any connected graph can
&gt;be built using nodes of degree 1,2 and 3, but that one cannot do it
&gt;with nodes only of degree 1 and 2.  (Degree of a node is the number
&gt;of arcs connected to it.) More precisely, it is that every connected
&gt;graph can be 'expanded' to a graph built using such nodes, where one
&gt;expands a graph by replacing some of its nodes by connected subgraphs
&gt;whose external arcs are isomorphic to the arcs to that node in the
&gt;first graph. In effect, the expanded graph has a subgraph which can
&gt;be collapsed (by identifying all its nodes and any connections
&gt;between them) into a single node of the original graph. In modern
&gt;terms one might say that the expanded graph is an implementation of
&gt;the first graph in which some nodes are implemented by datastructures
&gt;which are themselves connected graphs: imagine using LISP to encode a
&gt;graph, for example.
&gt;
&gt;It is easy to see how to construct such a datastructure for any node
&gt;of degree n &gt;3; one simply takes n-2  degree-3 nodes and links them
&gt;together in a chain: (view the following in a fixed-width font)
&gt;
&gt;      |      |      |      |           |
&gt;   ---1------2------3------4---....---n-2---
&gt;
&gt;which has n outgoing arcs to which the nodes linked to the original
&gt;node can be attached. Also it is pretty obvious that you couldn't do
&gt;it with nodes of degree 2, since the process of linking them together
&gt;would itself use up all but the two spare 'ends', so you can only get
&gt;another degree-2 graph.
&gt;
&gt;That is the sum total of the notion of 'irreducible triadicity'. It
&gt;is an interesting result in graph theory, but why is it considered to
&gt;have any deep importance in semantics and semiotics? To see why
&gt;Peirce thought it did, one has to appreciate how Peirce would have
&gt;interpreted a semantic network.
&gt;
&gt;A semantic network is a way of interpreting labelled graphs as sets
&gt;of assertions: the nodes of the graph correspond to things, and the
&gt;arcs of the graph correspond to relations. Only binary relations can
&gt;be directly accomodated in this way, so to encode the fact that a
&gt;relation R of greater arity (eg a trinary relation) holds, one
&gt;introduces a new node to be an 'R-fact', and links it to the
&gt;arguments of the trinary relation by arcs (which can be labelled with
&gt;relations like 'first', 'second', etc., if no intuitively sensible
&gt;relation names suggest themselves.) This corresponds to the logic
&gt;translation I gave in an earlier message, and it has been widely used
&gt;in KR work for many years.  (To give a full translation of FOL into
&gt;graphs requires other devices, including some way to represent
&gt;quantifier scope. John Sowa's CG's are an excellent example; I will
&gt;ignore this from now on as it is orthogonal to the 'triadicity'
&gt;issue.)
&gt;
&gt;With this encoding of relational language into graphs, the
&gt;irreducible triadicity result is not important, since the degree of a
&gt;node plays no special role in the interpretation (it corresponds to
&gt;the number of times a name is used in a logical expression). Peirce
&gt;however had a rather different way of interpreting such a graph. In
&gt;Peirce's graphical notation, the nodes of the graph, not the arcs,
&gt;are thought of as indicating relations, so that the degree of the
&gt;node is the number of arguments the relation has. With this
&gt;interpretation the degree of a node is clearly of much greater
&gt;importance, and the graph-theoretic result takes on a new
&gt;significance. It is therefore interesting to investigate this other
&gt;'Peircian' way of interpreting of a graph.
&gt;
&gt;One might object immediately that if the nodes are relations, what
&gt;part of the graph indicates the things the relations hold between, ie
&gt;the things related by the relations? This question gets to the heart
&gt;of the Peirce/Whitehead notion of the world being in some sense made
&gt;of process, rather than things; 'things' are thought of here as a
&gt;kind of convenient illusion (one which arises, in fact, from noticing
&gt;relations.) The relations are seen as the the metaphysical ground on
&gt;which the notion of individual is itself built. I do not want here to
&gt;get involved in this metaphysical discussion, but will just remark
&gt;that it is completely divorced from what might be called the
&gt;intellectual mainstream of the last century, in which mathematics and
&gt;formal semantics have been based on set theory, which in turn is
&gt;rooted in the idea of collecting together things, a notion which
&gt;depends on the idea of one individual thing being distinct from
&gt;another. I mention all this only to partly motivate what would
&gt;otherwise seem to be a very odd answer to the question about what in
&gt;the the graph denotes the individuals, which is Peirce's answer:
&gt;nothing. There are no individuals being related; there are only
&gt;relations. The basic 'connection' between relations expressed by the
&gt;arcs in the graph is now rather mysterious, but it can be thought of
&gt;as a kind of existential connection: it says that the two relations
&gt;share a kind of factual bonding at this point; they are mutually
&gt;instantiated. In modern terms one would write this as an explicit
&gt;existential claim using a quantifier:
&gt;(exists x)(R1(...x...) &amp; R2(.....x...))
&gt;where the dots indicate that the other arguments are filled in with
&gt;other, different, variables.
&gt;The quantifier is not really needed, and one can just use 'anonymous'
&gt;names of free variables:
&gt;R1(...x...) &amp; R2(.....x...)
&gt;   This is what an arc in the graph translates into in Peirce's view of
&gt;graphs as assertions. Notice that this is an exact dual of the
&gt;semantic network view of the graph: here, the arcs are the 'things'
&gt;and the nodes are the relations.
&gt;
&gt;If one thinks of relations as atoms, then this bonding is rather like
&gt;chemical valency, and the connected graphs which result are analogous
&gt;to molecules; and logic becomes a kind of relational chemistry. This
&gt;metaphor is superficially attractive, and in particular it has the
&gt;merit, if one feels that these 'things' are best kept out of sight,
&gt;of disposing of the connections as real things in themselves.
&gt;
&gt;This view of what a graph means, however, has some limitations.
&gt;Notice that in the translation into logic sketched above, it is
&gt;possible to use any variable (or individual name) at most twice,
&gt;corresponding to the two ends of the arc in the graph.  This produces
&gt;a curiously attenuated logic, in which for example it is not possible
&gt;to say that something has three properties:
&gt;P(x) &amp; Q(x) &amp; R(x)
&gt;has no Peircian graph corresponding to it (it would need an arc with
&gt;three ends). To overcome this, Peirce introduces a special class of
&gt;relations, called identity relations. Then the graph which would say
&gt;that this P-Q-R-ish thing existed would have the following
&gt;translation:
&gt;P(x) &amp; Q(y) &amp; R(z) &amp; I3(x, y, z)  (notice each variable is only in 2 places)
&gt;where I3 is the special relation of three-way identity, which Peirce
&gt;called 'teridentity'. The graph looks like this:
&gt;
&gt;                 P
&gt;                 |
&gt;                 |
&gt;           R----I3 ----Q
&gt;
&gt;There can be such special relations I-n for all finite n, but in fact
&gt;we only need I3, since the others can be 'implemented' using I3 in
&gt;the way outlined at the beginning, by chaining enough (n-2) I3's
&gt;together. Using a modern translation, for example, I5 can be defined
&gt;as
&gt;
&gt;I5(x y z u v)  &lt;==&gt;  I3(x y A) &amp; I3(A z B) &amp; I3(B u v)
&gt;
&gt;where the A and B links are 'private' to this little subgraph. Peirce
&gt;attributed great significance to the identity relations, as well he
&gt;might, since once they are put in place they clearly play the role of
&gt;individuals. To assert a relation of identity is to say that
&gt;something exists, and linking the identity to other relations says
&gt;that they hold of thing that exists.
&gt;
&gt;The above reduction-to-I3 trick doesnt work if you try to use just
&gt;I2, ie good old equals. You might think that it would be easy, since
&gt;it is easy to write it in modern logic:
&gt;I3(x y z) &lt;==&gt; (x=y) &amp; (y=z)
&gt;but if you now try to use this rewrite, the 'y' has been used up
&gt;since it occurs twice in the definition already - no name can be used
&gt;more than twice -  so you can't say that anything else equals y; so
&gt;this is really just I2(x,z). The two-ended nature of graph arcs has
&gt;got you cornered.  Triadicity really is irreducible in Peircian graph
&gt;language.
&gt;
&gt;Notice that the only triadic relation we really need is I3 itself,
&gt;since we can string together a suitable implementation for any n-ary
&gt;node using copies of I3, and even string an extra link to a node
&gt;which holds the label of the original node as well, and use binary or
&gt;unary relations for everything else; so any claim that some
&gt;*particular* relation (other than I3) is itself irreducibly triadic
&gt;must be based on some other criterion.
&gt;
&gt;The interest of this irreducibility, however, is relative to how
&gt;seriously one views the metaphysical consequences of the Peircian
&gt;interpretation of graphs. I suggest that it isn't of much interest
&gt;(other than historical), for several reasons. First, there's an
&gt;obviously better interpretation available (semantic networks.)
&gt;Second, the triadicity result applies to graphs, but it doesnt apply
&gt;to a simple generalization which is just as mathematically
&gt;respectable, if harder to draw, and which provides a more natural
&gt;structure to interpret in the Peircian fashion. Hypergraphs are
&gt;graphs where an arc (called a hyperarc) can link more than two nodes.
&gt;These have a very direct Peircian-style interpretation which doesnt
&gt;require the rather artificial 'identity relation' nodes; but
&gt;triadicity is reducible in hypergraphs. Third, if one asks what the
&gt;'identity relation' really is saying, it is clear that it amounts to
&gt;what would be expressed in modern terms as an existential assertion,
&gt;ie it says that some THING exists; and if we can refer to that thing,
&gt;it is obvious that any n-fold identity can be expressed as a
&gt;conjunction of binary equality statements. The irreducibility of
&gt;triadicity arises from a curiously obtuse combination of insisting
&gt;that existence can be expressed by using an identity relation, and
&gt;refusing to allow any way of referring to the thing that exists.

&gt;  ---1------2------3------4---....---n-2---
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/fixed&gt;which has n outgoing arcs to which the nodes linked to the
&gt;original node can be attached. Also it is pretty obvious that you
&gt;couldn't do it with nodes of degree 2, since the process of linking
&gt;them together would itself use up all but the two spare 'ends', so you
&gt;can only get another degree-2 graph.

&gt;using a quantifier:
&gt;
&gt;(exists x)(R1(...x...) &amp; R2(.....x...))
&gt;
&gt;where the dots indicate that the other arguments are filled in with
&gt;other, different, variables.
&gt;
&gt;The quantifier is not really needed, and one can just use 'anonymous'
&gt;names of free variables:
&gt;
&gt;R1(...x...) &amp; R2(.....x...)
&gt;
&gt;  This is what an arc in the graph translates into in Peirce's view of
&gt;graphs as assertions. Notice that this is an exact dual of the semantic
&gt;network view of the graph: here, the arcs are the 'things' and the
&gt;nodes are the relations.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If one thinks of relations as atoms, then this bonding is rather like
&gt;chemical valency, and the connected graphs which result are analogous
&gt;to molecules; and logic becomes a kind of relational chemistry. This
&gt;metaphor is superficially attractive, and in particular it has the
&gt;merit, if one feels that these 'things' are best kept out of sight, of
&gt;disposing of the connections as real things in themselves.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This view of what a graph means, however, has some limitations. Notice
&gt;that in the translation into logic sketched above, it is possible to
&gt;use any variable (or individual name) at most twice, corresponding to
&gt;the two ends of the arc in the graph.  This produces a curiously
&gt;attenuated logic, in which for example it is not possible to say that
&gt;something has three properties:
&gt;
&gt;P(x) &amp; Q(x) &amp; R(x)
&gt;
&gt;has no Peircian graph corresponding to it (it would need an arc with
&gt;three ends). To overcome this, Peirce introduces a special class of
&gt;relations, called identity relations. Then the graph which would say
&gt;that this P-Q-R-ish thing existed would have the following
&gt;translation:
&gt;
&gt;P(x) &amp; Q(y) &amp; R(z) &amp; I3(x, y, z)  (notice each variable is only in 2
&gt;places)
&gt;
&gt;where I3 is the special relation of three-way identity, which Peirce
&gt;called 'teridentity'. The graph looks like this:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;fixed&gt;               P
&gt;
&gt;                |
&gt;
&gt;                |
&gt;
&gt;          R----I3 ----Q
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/fixed&gt;There can be such special relations I-n for all finite n, but
&gt;in fact we only need I3, since the others can be 'implemented' using I3
&gt;in the way outlined at the beginning, by chaining enough (n-2) I3's
&gt;together. Using a modern translation, for example, I5 can be defined as
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I5(x y z u v)  &lt;&lt;==&gt;  I3(x y A) &amp; I3(A z B) &amp; I3(B u v)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;where the A and B links are 'private' to this little subgraph. Peirce
&gt;attributed great significance to the identity relations, as well he
&gt;might, since once they are put in place they clearly play the role of
&gt;individuals. To assert a relation of identity is to say that something
&gt;exists, and linking the identity to other relations says that they hold
&gt;of thing that exists.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The above reduction-to-I3 trick doesnt work if you try to use just I2,
&gt;ie good old equals. You might think that it would be easy, since it is
&gt;easy to write it in modern logic:
&gt;
&gt;I3(x y z) &lt;&lt;==&gt; (x=y) &amp; (y=z)
&gt;
&gt;but if you now try to use this rewrite, the 'y' has been used up since
&gt;it occurs twice in the definition already - no name can be used more
&gt;than twice -  so you can't say that anything else equals y; so this is
&gt;really just I2(x,z). The two-ended nature of graph arcs has got you
&gt;cornered.  Triadicity really is irreducible in Peircian graph language.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Notice that the only triadic relation we really need is I3 itself,
&gt;since we can string together a suitable implementation for any n-ary
&gt;node using copies of I3, and even string an extra link to a node which
&gt;holds the label of the original node as well, and use binary or unary
&gt;relations for everything else; so any claim that some *particular*
&gt;relation (other than I3) is itself irreducibly triadic must be based on
&gt;some other criterion.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The interest of this irreducibility, however, is relative to how
&gt;seriously one views the metaphysical consequences of the Peircian
&gt;interpretation of graphs. I suggest that it isn't of much interest
&gt;(other than historical), for several reasons. First, there's an
&gt;obviously better interpretation available (semantic networks.) Second,
&gt;the triadicity result applies to graphs, but it doesnt apply to a
&gt;simple generalization which is just as mathematically respectable, if
&gt;harder to draw, and which provides a more natural structure to
&gt;interpret in the Peircian fashion. Hypergraphs are graphs where an arc
&gt;(called a hyperarc) can link more than two nodes. These have a very
&gt;direct Peircian-style interpretation which doesnt require the rather
&gt;artificial 'identity relation' nodes; but triadicity is reducible in
&gt;hypergraphs. Third, if one asks what the 'identity relation' really is
&gt;saying, it is clear that it amounts to what would be expressed in
&gt;modern terms as an existential assertion, ie it says that some THING
&gt;exists; and if we can refer to that thing, it is obvious that any
&gt;n-fold identity can be expressed as a conjunction of binary equality
&gt;statements. The irreducibility of triadicity arises from a curiously
&gt;obtuse combination of insisting that existence can be expressed by
&gt;using an identity relation, and refusing to allow any way of referring
&gt;to the thing that exists.
