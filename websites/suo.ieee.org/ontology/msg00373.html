&gt;SUO Participants,
&gt;
&gt;1. Attached is the latest version of Ian Niles'  Merged Ontology.
&gt;
&gt;2. This message is a call for a vote as to whether this document should be
&gt;approved as a 'Base Document' for IEEE P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology
&gt;Working Group.  Within IEEE, there is no official definition of a Base
&gt;Document; however, the definitions below from the IEEE Learning Technology
&gt;Standards Committee (our original sponsor) are as good as any.
&gt;
&gt;3. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of consensus we have
&gt;for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need to decide if we
&gt;are going to go down this path or not.  Multiple base documents are
&gt;possible, so anyone else is free to submit one.
&gt;
&gt;4. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose improvements to the
&gt;document, unless they are major enough for you to vote against focusing work
&gt;on this document.  However, such general improvement comments are welcome
&gt;and will be resolved (but not until after completion of this Base Document
&gt;vote).
&gt;
&gt;5. Since we are still in the process of establishing official voting rights,
&gt;I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw poll, such that
&gt;anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if consensus is not
&gt;clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote (once voting
&gt;rights are established).
&gt;
&gt;6. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), NO (comments
&gt;required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt;

I vote NO.

Comments: I don't mean to denigrate Niles' hard work, but it is 
ridiculously premature to adopt this (or anything else like this) as 
a base document. This document doesnt even come close to the 
requirement for a base document given in the accompanying text:

&gt;base document: Starting point for standards words (it's clear the document
&gt;*can* be transformed into standards words).

It has no overall coherent ontological model; it represents a melange 
of conflicting and incommensurate views on many basic ontological 
issues. Its axioms have no global coherence (for example: the 
intended meaning of the quantifiers varies from one place to another 
in the document; later axioms do not conform to the categories 
introduced in the earlier axioms; many, if not most, of the major 
classifications depend on questionable and controversial philosphical 
presuppositions.) It fails to address many of the basic ontological 
issues that ned to be got clear before we can put any ontology to 
practical use (how to represent time and change, how to deal with 
alternative courses of reality, for example. ) Moreover, it is clear 
that the more 'pieces' are added to it, the more these problems are 
going to get worse rather than better.

This methodology is fundamentally flawed. There is no way to achieve 
a coherent ontology by 'merging' axioms from incommensurate 
ontological perspectives in this simplistic way. It is rather like 
trying to create  a large piece of software by just adjoining pieces 
of code written by different authors in different computer languages, 
and expecting it to magically work.

Apart from the general issues of a lack of a coherent methodology, I 
have many particular problems with much of the actual content of the 
document. As it stands, the ontology it outlines would be unworkable 
for me for almost any practical purpose, even if it were globally 
coherent. But this is not the right place to go into details.
