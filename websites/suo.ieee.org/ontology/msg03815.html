Hello,

I will just for the moment make remarks about Jon's view of
Peirce ideas and will later only try to correct his overlooking
of Hillman's or mines's

Jon Awbrey a écrit :

&gt; When things get too confusing I need to draw a picture.
&gt; Peirce is implicitly working within a relational context
&gt; that will eventually come to be called a &quot;sign relation&quot;.
&gt; This is a 3-adic relation whose role-places or role-players
&gt; are conventionally appellated as the &quot;object&quot;, the &quot;sign&quot;,
&gt; and the &quot;interpretant sign&quot; (or &quot;interpretant&quot; for short).
&gt; In extension, then, a sign relation L would be a subset
&gt; of a cartesian product, L c !O!x!S!x!I!.

From what Peirce said:

| Thus every increase in the number of equivalents of any term increases either
| its extension or comprehension and 'conversely'.  It may be said that there
| are no equivalent terms in logic, since the only difference between such
| terms would be merely external and grammatical, while in logic terms
| which have the same meaning are identical.  I fully admit that.
| Indeed, the process of getting an equivalent for a term is
| an identification of two terms previously diverse.  It is,
| in fact, the process of nutrition of terms by which they
| get all their life and vigor and by which they put forth
| an energy almost creative -- since it has the effect of
| reducing the chaos of ignorance to the cosmos of science.
| Each of these equivalents is the explication of what there is
| wrapt up in the primary -- they are the surrogates, the interpreters
| of the original term.  They are new bodies, animated by that same soul.
| I call them the 'interpretants' of the term.  And the quantity of these
| 'interpretants', I term the 'information' or 'implication' of the term.

And:
| nothing in common except what belongs to all other mammals.  Hence in this case
| the particular one may be substituted for the disjunctive term.  A disjunctive
| term, then, -- one which aggregates the extension of several symbols, -- may
| always be replaced by a simple term.

And:
| 'spherical, bright, fragrant, juicy, tropical fruit'.
|
| Such a term, formed by the sum of the comprehensions of several terms,
| is called a conjunctive term.  A conjunctive term has no extension

And:
| all 'conceptions'.  Most combinations of words are also symbols.
| A proposition, an argument, even a whole book may be, and
| should be, a single symbol.

I conclude that what Peirce calls a &quot;term&quot; is not only a single word but also
disjunctions and conjuctions of such words with the provision of substituting
&quot;simple terms&quot; for disjunctions which happen to be &quot;true symbols&quot;.
Therefore I figure that the &quot;signs&quot; and &quot;interpretant signs&quot; are in fact
one and the same domain and that they include conjunctions and disjunctions.
So the cartesian product is !O!x!T!x!T! where T = !S! u !conj! u !disj!

&gt; One way to read these 3-adic sign relations is to recognize that
&gt; the 2-adic relations formed by the sign and interpretant columns
&gt; constitute equivalence relations, and this property allows us to
&gt; graph the pertinent facts as shown in the next couple of Figures:

Good idea!
Then why not just having two tables instead of the 'join' of them
which is much more bulky.

Table 1.  Object Sign Relation L(A)

o---------------o---------------o
| Object        | Sign          |
o---------------o---------------o
| A             | &quot;A&quot;           | 
o---------------o---------------o
| B             | &quot;B&quot;           |
o---------------o---------------o

Table 1bis.  Sign Interpretant Relation L(A)
o---------------o---------------o
| Sign          | Interpretant  |
o---------------o---------------o
| &quot;A&quot;           | &quot;A&quot;           |
| &quot;A&quot;           | &quot;i&quot;           |
o---------------o---------------o
| &quot;B&quot;           | &quot;B&quot;           |
| &quot;B&quot;           | &quot;u&quot;           |
o---------------o---------------o

And the symmetrical for L(B)

&gt; o-----------------------------------------------------------o
&gt; 
&gt; These are the kinds of pictures that we like to see when it comes to
&gt; the relationships between objects and signs.  A double arrow between

NO, not for me, this is not the kind of pictures I like to see because 
I find them much less readable than the plain tables.

SideNote: 
  This is just a matter of personal taste, since the visual and
  spatial components of the Visuo Spatial Scratch Pad (VSSP) are
  surprisingly distinct and have different preferred uses in 
  different people, see:  BADDELEY A.D. and LIEBERMAN K. (1980) 
  &quot;Spatial working memory&quot; in R.S. Nickerson (Ed.) Attention and
  Performance, Hillsdale N.J., Lawrence Erlbaum, vol 8, 521-539
  
&gt; a pair of signs indicates that they are equivalent to each other in
&gt; the associated equivalence relation.  Since an equivalence relation
&gt; on a set partitions it into disjoint and exhaustive parts, another
&gt; way of describing the situation in each of these Figures is to say
&gt; that L(A) and L(B), or their projections on the subspace !S! x !I!,
&gt; each partitions the set of signs into subsets that correlate with
&gt; the objects in !O!.  Except for the annoying circumstance that each
&gt; sign relation carries out this partition in a different way, leaving
&gt; us with two partitions instead of just one, this would be the perfect
&gt; picture of how we naturally tend to think that signs and objects ought
&gt; to behave in regard to each other.

You are already trying to tackle the problems of merging ontologies from
different sources (the A and B players) plus the problem of ellipsis (&quot;I&quot;
and &quot;You&quot; depending on the context of reference) and confusing the referents 
(&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) with the denotations of the referents (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;You&quot;).
Where do you think you are going?
Is this what you mean by an explanation?

&gt; Lest we get totally lost in the devilish details,

Well, *you* made up the &quot;devilish details&quot;

&gt; I think that it might be a good idea to remember
&gt; what I observed once before about the main theme
&gt; of this whole part of Peirce's discussion:
&gt; 
&gt; At this point in his discussion, Peirce is relating the nature of
&gt; inference, inquiry, and information to the character of the signs
&gt; that are invoked in support of the overall process in question,
&gt; a process that he is presently describing as &quot;symbolization&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; The links among the types of signs -- icons, indices, symbols --
&gt; the aspects of semiosis -- connotation, denotation, information --
&gt; and the types of inference -- abduction, induction, deduction --
&gt; are parts of a bigger picture that we should try to keep in view.

Are you sure &quot;trying to keep in view&quot; such a *big* picture is the good
way to improve our understanding of the matter?
Why not carving out carefully some consistent pieces of it and then
trying to glue those pieces with the proper relations?

&gt; 
&gt; That is to say, in the beginning there is nothing but words,
&gt; and the objective side of the universe is all form and void.

Ha, ha, pure bollocks (sorry, cannot resist that one...)
No one could build any kind of concepts if it were not for some
examples of objects out of which he will painstakingly try to
make some sense by ordering them along concepts.

&gt; .../...
&gt; Still nothing happening on the objective side of the world.
&gt; Our first inkling of a connection to the &quot;world of matter&quot;
&gt; comes with the notions of denotation and Peirce's &quot;sphere&quot;.

Same remark, you will meet with &quot;actual&quot; men, horses, kangaroos and whales
before you figure out how they relate to each other.

&gt; | It is important to distinguish between the two
&gt; | functions of a word:  1st to denote something --
&gt; | to stand for something, and 2nd to mean something --
&gt; | or as Mr. Mill phrases it -- to 'connote' something.
&gt; |
&gt; | What it denotes is called its 'Sphere'.
&gt; | What it connotes is called its 'Content'.
&gt; |
&gt; | Thus the 'sphere' of the word 'man' is for me every man
&gt; | I know;  and for each of you it is every man you know.
&gt; |
&gt; | The 'content' of 'man' is all that we know of all men, as
&gt; | being two-legged, having souls, having language, &amp;c., &amp;c.
&gt; 
&gt; The question is:  What sort of thing is a connotation?
&gt; Is it a sign?  That is to say, is it yet another term?
&gt; Or is it something like an abstract attribute, namely,
&gt; a character, an intension, a property, or a quality?
&gt; And while we're asking, does it really even matter?

NO.
Before trying to answer a question do you ever ask yourself
for which ultimate purpose you want to get an answer?

&gt; Hmmm.  Now that I think of it,
&gt; I think I'll leave that as an
&gt; exercise for the reader, till
&gt; tomorrow, then ...

My understanding of 'Sphere' is the set of all things which the 
word can possibly name.
My understanding of 'Content' is the set of attributes, properties,
predicates (whatever you name this, I hope you understand what I mean)
that applies to *all* of those things in the 'Sphere'.

But these are *not* the meanings of &quot;denotation&quot; or &quot;connotation&quot;,
I *really* don't need to talk about these provided I can talk about
what is denoted and connoted. That is another level of discourse.

Kind regards.
