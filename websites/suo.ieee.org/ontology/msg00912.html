&gt;Gentlemen,
&gt;
&gt;	I don't agree with Pat's claim that the upper level of the merged
&gt;ontology is 'fixed' or less subject to modification than the lower levels.
&gt;In fact, the upper level has undergone more revisions than any of the lower
&gt;level ontologies that were grafted on to it.

Yes, you are right, and I chose my words poorly: sorry. I didn't mean 
to accuse you of being overly rigid in not altering the upper levels. 
What I meant was that you see the process as one of fitting lower 
categories into supercategories: the typical basic operation is to 
take a concept and say 'where in the heirarchy should this go?', and 
then maybe alter things if you can't find a good place to put it. 
Whereas, I would suggest, the better strategy would be to simply 
defer that kind of 'where to hang this?' decision until one has a 
reasonably extensive collection of theories each of which has a 
reasonably clear statement of the kinds of 'thing' it claims to be 
about and the assumptions it is making, and *then* synthesise an 
appropriate heirarchy to hang them on. The idea being that the upper 
echelons of the heirarchy are more likely to be useful if they have 
been designed to fit the actual contentful ideas onto, rather than 
being designed a priori. Particularly when there seem to be tools in 
the offing which can do this latter job semi-automatically.

I think this strategy is particularly likely to be more productive 
for the SUO, since the actual things which engineers, biologists and 
folk like that actually need to be able to talk about are often quite 
different from the classifications that philosophers, no matter how 
insightful they are, tend to get all persnickety about, so that there 
is always going to be a mismatch betweeen any a priori high-level 
categorisation heirarchy and the actual things that are going to have 
to find a place on it. This mismatch has two dimensions, in fact: the 
philosophers make distinctions which the engineers don't need (like 
continuant/occurrent), and the engineers, biologists, etc. come up 
with entities which the philosophers havnt ever even thought about 
(like nonlinear coefficients of friction and lipid bilayer membranes) 
and which rip the conceptual fabric to pieces when one tries to put 
them into it.

&gt;Furthermore, it isn't true
&gt;that the lower level ontologies have been extensively modified to fit them
&gt;onto Sowa's upper level.  My strategy has been to locate a node in Sowa's
&gt;ontology which could reasonably be regarded as a most specific subsumer of
&gt;the highest level node of a lower level ontology or, failing that, creating
&gt;an intermediate structure of concepts between a node in Sowa's ontology and
&gt;the highest level node in the lower level ontology.  Accordingly, I haven't
&gt;altered the essential integrity of the lower level ontologies in
&gt;merging/aligning them with the upper level.  In general, I would prefer a
&gt;"reflective equilibrium" approach to ontology design.  Lower level concepts
&gt;will cast light on the question of which upper level concepts need to be
&gt;included, but the high level notions of philosophy and linguistics are
&gt;probably a pretty good approximation of the kinds of concepts we'll need at
&gt;the tip of the ontology.

Ah, there I absolutely and profoundly disagree with you. As I said 
above, I have severe doubts that one is going to get many useful 
practical distinctions out of philosophy (some, but not many; and 
they will all need to be altered in practice. Particularly if the 
philosophers are Peirce and Whitehead. I encourage anyone who thinks 
otherwise to actually try to read Peirce or Whitehead.); and as for 
linguistics, the conceptual distinctions it provides are actively 
harmful to any useful physical ontology. They are like sand in an 
engine. If you are using *linguistic* criteria to drive your 
upper-level classifying then it really is a complete waste of time to 
go on with this effort, in my view. I have better things to do. (BTW, 
if you really are serious about linguistics, then you ought to take 
linguistic data more seriously. Get hold of Jerry Hobbs' writings on 
language-inspired ontology design, and see where that line takes you.)

Pat Hayes

PS. Talking of reflective equilibrium, think what the equilibrium 
state is when you mix oil and water.
