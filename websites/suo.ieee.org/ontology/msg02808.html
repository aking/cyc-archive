In topic maps representations, we have the important notion of "scope" for
association roles and topic characteritics (including names), enabling to
make coexist in the same representation different views of the world, which
can for example be expressed as different truth values for a given sentence.
I don't know KIF very well so far - I begin to explore it a little deeper
right now - but it looks to me at first sight there is no obvious way to
make some equivalent of "scope" for a KIF sentence.

&gt; Matt and Bernard,
&gt;    I think these issues are quite relevant.  I like Matt's
characterization
&gt; of the options for resolving different approaches.  I would concur that
the
&gt; most useful approach to "the market" would be to make some arbitrary but
&gt; reasonable choices.  We also have an option of creating contexts within
the
&gt; SUO that encode different views although I'd advocate using that option
&gt; sparingly.

&gt; &gt;I don't feel your remarks and questions as off-topic. To know if
intention,
&gt; &gt;awareness, purpose versus random, instinct, physical process should be a
&gt; &gt;major ontological distinction is not IMO a minor question. And it is
really
&gt; &gt;a good example of where the cultural context does weigh on the ontology,
and
&gt; &gt;even if the global feedback (or absence of feedback) I got on this
question
&gt; &gt;lately seems to indicate that most people on this forum consider such
&gt; &gt;questions as being out of scope, I'll stick to the viewpoint that they
are
&gt; &gt;not.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you have an animist-pantheist view of the world, the intentionality is
as
&gt; &gt;present in the willow growth or constellations patterns than in the
building
&gt; &gt;of a temple. If you have a positivist-reductionist view of the world,
there
&gt; &gt;is no more intentionality in any of those than in any other, because the
&gt; &gt;notion of intentionality is considered as irrelevant altogether.
&gt; &gt;Between those two extremes is a middle path that most people today I
think
&gt; &gt;implicitly agree to walk on, where the frontier between "random physical
&gt; &gt;process" and "intentional process" is a very fuzzy one, depending on
one's
&gt; &gt;undecidable arguments about what one considers to be intentional.
&gt; &gt;Controverses on universe and life evolution, anthropic principle (weak or
&gt; &gt;strong), Gaia, Global Brain and others of the same kind show that even
&gt; &gt;physical processes in the early hot universe may be considered by some
&gt; &gt;people
&gt; as "early intentions".
&gt; &gt;One interesting cutting approach is to be found in Thermodynamics (works
of
&gt; &gt;Prigogine and others), a cutoff being possible between near-equilibrium
&gt; &gt;processes well described by statistical laws (first and second
thermodynamic
&gt; &gt;principles: a crowd in panic maybe in this case if people are considered
as
&gt; &gt;particles with random moves commanded by pression, temperature and
volume),
&gt; &gt;and far-for-equilibrium complex processes like air transport regulation,
&gt; &gt;football games, bird migrations and forest growth. Such a cutoff is maybe
&gt; &gt;the less culturally biased possible among the presently available
&gt; &gt;distinctions, in the sense that it can be grounded on somehow measurable
&gt; &gt;characteristics, not on undecidable judgments.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But the name we will give those categories will be loaded anyway. Not
&gt; &gt;mentioning purpose anywhere in the classification of processes - sticking
to
&gt; &gt;thermodynamics categories - would make this classification irrelevant
&gt; &gt;wherever the users will want to declare intentionality (because in their
&gt; &gt;view of the world, there is intentionality), and moreover would
implicitly
&gt; &gt;declare that intentionality in itself is a somehow irrelevant concept. So
&gt; &gt;maybe we have to keep intentionality as a (possible) attribute of
process,
&gt; &gt;but abstain to declare which classes of process - if any - have this
&gt; &gt;property, letting it open to every user.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is IMO just one aspect of the problem of cultural context. We have
many
&gt; &gt;undecidable propositions of that kind at the upper level. I would tend to
&gt; &gt;consider that undecidability is even a *characteristic* of the upper
level.
&gt; &gt;Otherwise, the work we are on would have been achieved centuries ago.
&gt; &gt;Culture is built on what a community agrees on about the major
undecidable.
&gt; &gt;So either we try to be the less culturally biased and build a
deliberately
&gt; &gt;ambiguous and fuzzy ontology, leaving open and available every choice
about
&gt; &gt;undecidable propositions, and letting every user choose whatever fits
one's
&gt; &gt;community view of the world, either we build a "unique thought" efficient
&gt; &gt;fit-all consensual ontology, cutting of the undecidable in an axiomatic
&gt; &gt;(dogma
&gt; &gt;tic?) way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My hunch is that the market would be happy with the latter, and the
&gt; &gt;civilization with the former ... but I digress :o)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm just curious about something.  If a flock of geese (in formation)
&gt; &gt; &gt; exhibits agency, what about:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; * a swarm of bees?
&gt; &gt; &gt; * a cult
&gt; ure of slime mold cells (collecting to form a stalk)?
&gt; &gt; &gt; * a crowd in a panic?
&gt; &gt; &gt; * a gameboard of Conway's 'Life'?
&gt; &gt; &gt; * particles in a multi-body physics problem?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm wondering about collective behavior or structure that looks
&gt; &gt; &gt; "organized" but that might have "intentionality" ranging from high to
&gt; &gt; &gt; none.  To me, "Organization" as a label implies intentionally-created
&gt; &gt; &gt; structure, rather than naturally-emergent structure.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is, if you would call a flock of geese an Organization, but you
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't call a willow tree an Organization (even though we can
observe
&gt; &gt; &gt; very rich and useful structure in it), it seems the difference is our
&gt; &gt; &gt; assumption that the geese are actively choosing to be in formation.
If
&gt; &gt; &gt; so, where is the cutoff between awareness, instinct, reflex, and
low-level
&gt; &gt; &gt; chemical/physical processes that tell us when we're looking at agents
or
&gt; &gt; &gt; organizati
&gt; &gt;ons?  Somewhat off-topic, I know; I just found it a curious
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem.
