Jon,

Below, you state "The mathematical and computational tools needed to
implement such a perspective goes beyond the understanding of systems and
their spaces that I currently have
in my command," to which this reply is directed.

The keywords 'manifold' and 'fiber bundle' attracted my attention here.  You
have moved the discussion into a topological space and I am reminded that
the Mathematical Biologist Robert Rosen has written two books (and a third
published post mortem) in the field of Relational Biology.  In his
_Anticipatory Systems_, he discusses fiber space.  In _Life Itself_, he
discusses Aristotle's causality, and rounds the discussion with an
exposition of Category Theory (CT) as a candidate mathematics for knowledge
modeling of complex systems.

CT,  a topological algebra, is far beyond my reach, and I am not capable of
extending Rosen's arguments in favor of looking at CT, but there certainly
are others who have seen the relationship between CT and knowledge modeling.
Indeed, Barwise and others brought it into their work.  My friend Howard Liu
and I have been discussing ways to map Peirce's thinking into a CT
framework, perhaps through extensions to John Sowa's work. Our primary link
to Peirce has been through discussions with Mary Keeler, coupled with your
writing.

Extending that field of thinking may not be appropriate to the SUO list.
Perhaps it warrants a separate venue?

Cheers

But there is another reason why the factorization problem presents an
especially
acute obstacle to progress in the system-theoretic approach to AI.  When the
states
of a system are viewed as a manifold it is usual to imagine that everything
factors
nicely into a base manifold and a remainder.  Smooth surfaces come to mind,
a single
clear picture of a system that is immanently good for all time.  But this is
how an
outside observer might see it, not how it appears to the inquiring system
that is
located in a single point and has to discover, starting from there, the most
fitting
description of its own space.  The proper division of a state vector into
basic and
derivative factors is itself an item of knowledge to be discovered.  It
constitutes
a piece of interpretive knowledge that has a large part in determining
exactly how
an agent behaves.  The tentative hypotheses that an agent spins out with
respect to
this issue will themselves need to be accommodated in a component of free
space that
is well under control.  Without a stable theater of action for entertaining
hypotheses,
an agent finds it difficult to sustain interest in the kinds of speculative
bets that
are required to fund a complex inquiry.

States of information with respect to the placement of this fret or fulcrum
can
vary with time.  Indeed, it is a goal of the knowledge directed system to
leverage
this chordal node toward optimal possibilities, and this normally requires a
continuing
interplay of experimental variations with attunement to the results.
Therefore it seems
necessary to develop a view of manifolds in which the location or depth of
the primary
division that is effective in explaining behavior can vary from moment to
moment.
The total phenomenal state of a system is its most fundamental reality, but
the
way in which these states are connected to make a space, with information
that
metes out distances, portrays curvatures, and binds fibers into bundles --
all this is an illusion projected onto the mist of individual states
from items of code in the knowledge component of the current state.

The mathematical and computational tools needed to implement such a
perspective
goes beyond the understanding of systems and their spaces that I currently
have
in my command.  It is considered bad form for a workman to blame his tools,
but
in practical terms there continues to be room for better design.  The
languages
and media that are made available do, indeed, make some things easier to
see,
to say, and to do than others, whether it is English, Pascal (Wirth, 1976),
or Hopi (Whorf, 1956) that is being spoken.  A persistent attention to this
pragmatic factor in epistemology will be necessary to implement the brands
of knowledge-directed systems whose intelligence can function in real time.
To provide a computational language that can help to clarify these problems
is one of the chief theoretical tasks that I see for myself in the work
ahead.

A system moving through a knowledge field would ideally be equipped with
a strategy for discovering the structure of that field to the greatest
extent
possible.  That ideal strategy is a piece of knowledge, a segment of code
existing
in the knowledge space of every point that has this option within its
potential.
Does discovery mark only a different awareness of something that already
exists,
a changed attitude toward a piece of knowledge already possessed?  Or can it
be
something more substantial?  Are genuine invention and proper extensions of
the
shared code possible?  Can intelligent systems acquire pieces of knowledge
that
are not already in their possession, or in their potential to know?

If a piece of code is near at hand, within a small neighborhood of a
system's place in
a knowledge field, then it is easy to see a relationship between adherence
and discovery.
It is possible to picture how crumbs of code could be traced back,
accumulated, and gradually
reassembled into whole slices of the desired program.  But what if the
required code is more
distant?  If a system is observed in fact to drift toward increasing states
of knowledge,
does its disposition toward knowledge as a goal need to be explained by some
inherent
attraction of knowledge?  Do potential fields and propagating influences
have to be
imagined in order to explain the apparent action at a distance?  Do massive
bodies
of knowledge then naturally form, and eventually come to dominate whole
knowledge
fields?  Are some bodies of knowledge intrinsically more attractive than
others?
Can inquiries get so serious that they start to radiate gravity?

Questions like these are only ways of probing the range of possible systems
that
are implied by the definition of a knowledge field.  What abstract
possibility best
describes a given concrete system is a separate, empirical question.  With
luck, the
human situation will be found among the reasonably learnable universes, but
before that
hope can be evaluated a lot remains to be discovered about what, in fact,
may be learnable
and reasonable.
