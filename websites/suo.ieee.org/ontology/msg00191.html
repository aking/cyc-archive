Matthew --
   Thanks for the clarification:
&gt; 
&gt; The port engine on a plane is an example of an object that 
&gt; can have periods of non-existance. When one engine is 
&gt; removed for maintenance, and replaced by another. 
&gt; However, your description of Pat's intent is sufficiently
&gt; unconstrained to cover that case.
&gt; 
   This is an important issue, and I will provide my
current thoughts on it.
   This phenomenon is not one I would represent as being
some form of intermittent "concrete_existence".  I would reserve 
"concrete_existence" for individual objects.  A specification of the
parts for some artifact, or protoypical natural object, is a definition
of some class of objects, which a particular object in the real world 
may or may not conform to.  To be consistent, I think such definitions
need to refer to prototypes or "complete" objects.  The individual 
parts may be classified as "vital", "essential" "typical", "optional",
"disjoint-alternate", or "accessory" -- for example.  The assertions of 
the "presence" or "absence" of some designed part of an artifact at 
some particular time and place, whether it is connected as intended in 
the design, and whether it is functional, are time-dependent assertions 
about specific instances of objects that don't change the definition of 
the complete artifact.   A particular artifact that can serve the role of
a part of a plane may or may not be designated as "belonging"
to some particular plane (e.g. while being repaired), which is 
not the same as saying that it is "in-place" and "functional".  I would
view these latter three assertions as time-dependent slots (or axioms) 
on the specific instance of a part itself.
   Assuming that some instance of an artifact such as a plane is 
sufficiently intact to be termed a plane, even though incomplete, it 
should have time-dependent attributes such as "complete", or 
"functional".  If "incomplete" there will be some list of parts that 
are "missing".  Whether an artifact can be pulled apart and 
cease its "existence" and then be re-assembled and said
to exist again under the same instance-name is a convention that
depends on "identity criteria", which Guarino has labored much
to clarify.  If there is some single vital part (fuselage?)
which by convention defines whether some object exists or not, 
regardless of the presence of other parts, then intermittent 
existence should not occur; the "incomplete" artifact would exist
as soon as the vital part came into existence, and cease to exist 
when that vital part ceased to exist (and recursively for the
"vital part").  Alternatively, existence could be said to begin only 
when some artifact has achieved functionality at some time, and 
subsequent existence might be defined as being existence of the 
vital part.
    This may not seem to conform to intuitive or linguistic
usage, but linguistic usage is fairly broad.  I've heard people 
say, e.g., that "John's car is scattered all over his driveway.  He's 
getting the heads planed."  The existence of John's car is not
questioned in such a case, but its physical state of division certainly
doesn't conform to a definition of a prototypical connected and
functional object.  I'd be interested to learn what you think
is the best way to represent all the possible permutations of
parts, including multiple alternative replacements, even sticking
only to artifacts.
    I think that to cover all bases, an "intermittent existence"
should be allowed, if it doesn't conflict with other desirable
properties of existence.  But I have no idea what conflicts may 
occur; it depends on how people may want to use the concept
of "concrete_existence".

-----------------------------
&gt; In the SC4 community we managed to develop incompatible models, 
&gt; even when starting from a common core. I see little chance that 
&gt; ontologies will be mergeable with anything other than 
&gt; a lot of hard work by humans without
&gt; that having been part of their design intent. 
    I don't disagree.  That argues for maximizing the size of 
the extension "Reference Shared Ontology".  Your experience in
developing different ontologies using a common basis should be
quite relevant to what the SUO is doing, and if there is some 
good synopsis of the experience you mentioned, it could be 
very instructive for us.   I wouldn't be surprised to discover
that over half of the terms intended to represent the 
same concept are defined differently by different ontologists,
even with an SUO.  Without an SUO, it would be closer to 99%.
    If an SUO and a Reference Shared Ontology existed, and I wanted
my ontology to communicate with others, I would bend way over 
backwards to use those ontologies, and contribute to the RSO any
new definitions I created myself.  If that was a common 
practice, the RSO could eventually handle a lot of different
specific domains.  We are nowhere near the point where that 
can be discussed in concrete terms, but since the goal
of interoperability is central to the SUO, it is worthwhile
recognizing that the more detail that is standardized, the greater
will be the interoperability, and true interoperability will 
require a rather large shared ontology, and that won't likely 
happen for a long time unless major funding is found.  Meanwhile 
building an SUO is a good starting point to explore the problems.

&gt; Dear Pat,
&gt; 
&gt; I think you are optimistic about how merging independent 
&gt; ontologies will
&gt; arise. In the SC4 community we managed to develop 
&gt; incompatible models, even
&gt; when starting from a common core. I see little chance that 
&gt; ontologies will
&gt; be mergeable with anything other than a lot of hard work by 
&gt; humans without
&gt; that having been part of their design intent. ISO18876 tries 
&gt; to set out an
&gt; architecture within which this is possible.
&gt; 
&gt; The port engine on a plane is an example of an object that 
&gt; can have periods
&gt; of non-existance. When one engine is removed for maintenance, 
&gt; and replaced
&gt; by another. However, your description of Pat's intent is sufficiently
&gt; unconstrained to cover that case.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Matthew --
&gt; &gt;     Your point about the difficulty of creating different extensions
&gt; &gt; to a common basic ontology without generating some kind of conflict 
&gt; &gt; is well taken:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: You seem to be making an assumption of minimal overlap. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My experience is this is generally not true. If we just 
&gt; &gt; &gt; look at these two cases some areas of
&gt; &gt; &gt; overlap are:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - Measurement of e.g. temperature, pressure, flowrate
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - chemical processes themselves, they go on in the body as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; well as chemical
&gt; &gt; &gt; plant
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - chemicals - the body is a bag of chemicals
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - process plant - e.g. dialysis machines are process plants
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - drugs are chemical products
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So the differing viewpoints on these (and probably other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; areas) would need to be integrated, rather than just added to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; each other.
&gt; &gt; [PC]:
&gt; &gt;     Yes, this will be especially true if detailed relations 
&gt; or axioms
&gt; &gt; are attached to newly-defined objects, so that there are multiple 
&gt; &gt; links to other objects, which will increase the chances of conflict.
&gt; &gt; There is a *possibility* of having different extensions of the SUO 
&gt; &gt; with no conflicts.  The more likely case is for two differently-
&gt; &gt; developed ontologies to have some conflicting definitions.  If the 
&gt; &gt; conflicting concepts have the same names, they can be easily 
&gt; &gt; recognized 
&gt; &gt; and some resolution may be possible.  If the same notion is defined
&gt; &gt; using different labels, that also can be recognized, if all
&gt; &gt; relations are the same.  When two application ontologies 
&gt; use different
&gt; &gt; labels *and* different logical terms to define the same 
&gt; notion, that 
&gt; &gt; will present a really tough case to recognize.  Using an SUO is
&gt; &gt; still light-years ahead of using no common defining vocabulary,
&gt; &gt; for recognizing similarities and conflicts.
&gt; &gt;     To minimize the chances of unnecessary conflicts of that 
&gt; &gt; kind I think we
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; do need to have a "Reference SUO extension" which contains 
&gt; all of the
&gt; &gt; *consistent*
&gt; &gt; concepts that contributors are willing to submit and are 
&gt; &gt; definable using the
&gt; &gt; concepts in the SUO.  The SUO itself, I hope, will have as much as 
&gt; &gt; possible of the basic logical and semantic elements as are 
&gt; &gt; necessary to 
&gt; &gt; define most or all of the specialized concepts that will be needed
&gt; &gt; for practical applications.  
&gt; &gt;    The SUO committee will probably have to make contentious choices
&gt; &gt; regarding the contents of both basic SUO and any extension.  At this
&gt; &gt; early point, I hope we can make some progress toward perhaps some 
&gt; &gt; significant fraction of an SUO, with an embryonic 
&gt; "Reference extension
&gt; &gt; containing enough defined concepts to make the SUO definitions
&gt; &gt; clear.
&gt; &gt;     But for the particular cases you cited above:
&gt; &gt;  (1)  I would expect basic units of measure to be part of the 
&gt; &gt; SUO itself.
&gt; &gt; Many object-specific or industry-specific attributes would be more
&gt; &gt; appropriate in an extension or a domain ontology.
&gt; &gt;  (2) chemical processes do indeed go on in the body as well 
&gt; as process
&gt; &gt; plants,
&gt; &gt; and everywhere else in the visible universe, except extreme 
&gt; &gt; environments 
&gt; &gt; like neutron stars.  I would expect a "chemical_process" to 
&gt; &gt; be part of the
&gt; &gt; SUO, and with a reasonable definition, I wouldn't expect any 
&gt; &gt; conflicts.  A "commercial_chemical_process" could be a subclass.
&gt; &gt;  (3) the body as a "bag of chemicals" (or more generally a 
&gt; structured
&gt; &gt; physical object as *solely* a "piece of some stuff") is 
&gt; &gt; unrealistic and
&gt; &gt; should not be allowed in the SUO.  Such objects have other essential
&gt; &gt; features.
&gt; &gt;  (4) I would expect a chemical "process plant" definition to exclude
&gt; &gt; small-scale reactors such as laboratory vessels and animal stomachs.
&gt; &gt; A "pilot_plant" would be an intermediate-scale case.  
&gt; &gt; Definitions by size 
&gt; &gt; would be fuzzy, which is why I think that for artifacts, 
&gt; &gt; definitions by 
&gt; &gt; intended use, with subclasses having some physical 
&gt; constraints,  are 
&gt; &gt; most stable.
&gt; &gt;   (5)  Most drugs are indeed chemical products, having a 
&gt; &gt; specific intended
&gt; &gt; use;
&gt; &gt; but some are processed natural substances.  I think there 
&gt; is a useful 
&gt; &gt; distinction to be made between artifactual substances and those 
&gt; &gt; extracted from nature, and I hope that such a distinction can 
&gt; &gt; be encoded 
&gt; &gt; in the SUO.
&gt; &gt; ------------
&gt; &gt; On time intervals:
&gt; &gt; [Pat Hayes (paper)}:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  A timeinterval is a connected piece of the time-plenum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Things that have a temporal extent, or which occupy time in some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way, must have a time interval which is their life-span.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Just a check on what you mean here. An object may also 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have many time intervals of existance, not just one. Right?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     That section is a quote from Pat Hayes's paper, and my 
&gt; &gt; interpretation of that sentence is that there is some 
&gt; &gt; timepoint before 
&gt; &gt; which a temporally-located object did not exist (in the 
&gt; real world), 
&gt; &gt; and a time after which it no longer exists.  I am unfamiliar with 
&gt; &gt; the concept you refer to as having "many time intervals of 
&gt; existence"
&gt; &gt; (unless you are thinking of observations by different 
&gt; observers using
&gt; &gt; different clocks in a relativistic framework).  Is there a 
&gt; reference 
&gt; &gt; to a discussion of that manner of representation?

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Pat C,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; A few comments.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; snip
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Clarification: "different" ontologies
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    To clarify a point about the goal of interoperability: Pat's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earlier note asked how ontologies using an SUO can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "different":
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Pat Cassidy]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;    My understanding of the purpose (or one purpose) 
&gt; of the SUO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effort was to create a defining vocabulary of basic 
&gt; terms that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; will allow a user to define a concept in terms of the SUO and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thereby permit someone with a different ontology to use the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; same concept, with the same axioms and inferences, when two 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ontologies want to transfer information.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Already this seems odd. If they are using the same axioms and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inferences, then in what sense are the ontologies 
&gt; different? An
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ontology only is a set of axioms. The key point is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different ontologies will not use the same axioms, not even 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same nonlogical vocabulary, and that the various 
&gt; &gt; vocabularies 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in use will be(and already are) profoundly 
&gt; irreconcilable with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each other.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Two ontologies can be "different" in the intended sense if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they both use the SUO, and differ by having different added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; definitions, not necessarily covering the same area of 
&gt; knowledge.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One ontology for example may have added definitions and axioms
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about health care, and another about some chemical manufacturing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process.  If these two ontologies are to be used to exchange
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conceptual information in one of those two specialized 
&gt; areas, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining axioms need to be exchanged, and unless there is some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conflict in one or more of the added definitions, both
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ontologies, *after* exchange of axioms, would in effect be the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same, and inferences that both systems make about the 
&gt; same topics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be identical.  This should be true even if not all added
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; axioms in both ontologies were exchanged, but only those
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; affecting the areas in which information is to be 
&gt; exchanged -- in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this case the resulting ontologies will only be "the same" with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respect to the common set of concepts, and otherwise 
&gt; "different".
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: You seem to be making an assumption of minimal overlap. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My experience is
&gt; &gt; &gt; this is generally not true. If we just look at these two 
&gt; &gt; &gt; cases some areas of
&gt; &gt; &gt; overlap are:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - Measurement of e.g. temperature, pressure, flowrate
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - chemical processes themselves, they go on in the body as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; well as chemical
&gt; &gt; &gt; plant
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - chemicals - the body is a bag of chemicals
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - process plant - e.g. dialysis machines are process plants
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - drugs are chemical products
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So the differing viewpoints on these (and probably other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; areas) would need
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be integrated, rather than just added to each other.
&gt; &gt; &gt; snip
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                 3. TEMPORAL THEORIES
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                 ____________________
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The theories we consider differ in several respects, both in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their axiomatic style and in the intuitions they support.  Most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theories are consistent with the following ideas:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  A timeinterval is a connected piece of the time-plenum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Things that have a temporal extent, or which occupy time in some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way, must have a time interval which is their life-span.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Just a check on what you mean here. An object may also 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have many time
&gt; &gt; &gt; intervals of existance, not just one. Right?
