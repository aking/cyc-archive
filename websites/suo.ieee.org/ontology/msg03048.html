Howard,

I sense that one of our difficulties understanding each other may involve
a question of just what a pragmatic philosophy of the Peircean persuasion
actually is.  For instance, I have noted, but do not yet quite understand,
a contrast that you make to pose between the way that a typical physicist
thinks, or perhaps is supposed to think, and the way that one I typically
call a &quot;pragmatician&quot; thinks, or ought to think.  In an effort to clarify
that aspect of the problem, I will try to set out a more positive account
of what it is, as exactly as my rough and ready description can render it,
that constitutes &quot;pragmatic thinking&quot;, that is, of this particular stripe.

If you seek the rule that a pragmatic thinker follows, then the name for
that would be the &quot;Pragmatic Maxim&quot;.  Now this maxim is an abstract rule,
and so there are, and will be more, many splintry ways of formulating it.
Peirce gave five or six among the set that I have studied most carefully,
but I think that it satisfices to begin with this, my own favorite motto:

| Consider what effects that might conceivably
| have practical bearings you conceive the
| objects of your conception to have.  Then,
| your conception of those effects is the
| whole of your conception of the object.
|
| Charles Sanders Peirce, 'The Maxim of Pragmatism', CP 5.438

Here is the context of this version, which also gives another variant:

| Pragmaticism was originally enounced in the form of a maxim, as follows:
| Consider what effects that might 'conceivably' have practical bearings you 'conceive'
| the objects of your 'conception' to have.  Then, your 'conception' of those effects
| is the whole of your 'conception' of the object.
|
| I will restate this in other words, since ofttimes one can thus eliminate
| some unsuspected source of perplexity to the reader.  This time it shall be
| in the indicative mood, as follows:  The entire intellectual purport of any
| symbol consists in the total of all general modes of rational conduct which,
| conditionally upon all the possible different circumstances and desires,
| would ensue upon the acceptance of the symbol.
|
| Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 5.438

Here is an incidental exegesis that I rendered on this maxim on another occasion:

| It is common to miss the indexical character of the pronouns
| in this statement, and to think that he said something about
| &quot;the conception&quot; rather than something about &quot;thy conception&quot;.
| There is another version that speaks of &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, but it
| changes only the poignancy, and not the point of this address.
|
| Whether this currently most popular misreading arises from the
| horror of relativism that most of us learned in the Academy --
| a force apparently so overpowering that it leads us to deny,
| formally speaking, the role of interpretive communities in the
| very pictures of &quot;what is&quot; that they themselves will formulate --
| and whether or not that was actually the lesson that any of us
| was supposed to derive from obeying the dictum to &quot;know thyself&quot; --
| I just hope that it will not be the ultimately persistent message.
|
| The world did not go away when relativity came to physics,
| and I do not believe we need to have fears about ontology.
|
| I bring this up now, not just because it is a recurrent issue, anyway,
| but because it is relevant to the nature of the interpreter that makes
| judgments about category assignments in formulating and implementing
| an ontology, and also to the quality of the inquiry that ensues when
| there emerges a lack of consensus about them.
|
| For this audience, it can be noted that the pragmatic maxim
| is basically a &quot;principle of representation&quot;, logically akin
| to the &quot;regular representations&quot; and the &quot;term models&quot; of all
| sorts of algebraic structures, from groups to lambda calculi.
| My memory is dim, but I believe that theorems on the subject
| of &quot;Peirce Representations&quot; are some of the few for which
| the Peirces, B. or C., still retain credit in mathematics.

To avert a host of other potential misreadings,
it might be noted that, for Peirce, a 'concept'
or a 'conception' is a special type of 'symbol'.

I will discuss a few of the logical implications
and practical consequences of this maxim as we go.
