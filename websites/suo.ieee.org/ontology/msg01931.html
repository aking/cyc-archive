<b><u>Draft</u></b> of motion for adoption by general (unanimous) consent
<p><b>Motion:&nbsp;</b> Request for adoption by general (unanimous) consent.
<p><b>Resolved:</b> Any voting member of the IEEE SUO Working Group may
post a document to the SUO web page as an "<i>Expert contribution<sup><font color="#FF0000">1</font></sup></i><font color="#000000">".&nbsp;</font>
The member who posts a document is presumptively the technical editor<sup><font color="#FF0000">2</font></sup>
of the document and by posting agrees to perform these duties or alternatively
name another member (either voting or candidate member<sup><font color="#FF0000">3</font></sup>)
who agrees to perform the duties of technical editor.&nbsp; No vote will
be required to post a document or name an editor.
<p>The statement&nbsp; "All documents posted are deemed to have equal status
and no document has any preferred position over any other document." will
precede the list of documents.&nbsp; No separate category of documents
may be created without an explicit vote of the members.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><sup><font color="#FF0000">1</font></sup><font color="#000000">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;
</i>This is a name suggested by John Sowa and I think it is an appropriate
one<i>.&nbsp; </i>It seems the IEEE SUO web page (suo.ieee.org) was changed
today (3/27/01) to eliminate the heading "</font><i>Document being worked
on by this Working Group" - t</i>he heading where the Teknowledge Merged
Ontology was previously listed.&nbsp; The Teknowledge Merged Ontology is
now listed (along with David Whitten's structural ontology) under <i>"Candidate
Content to be merged into a standard"</i>.&nbsp; This is probably not a
good choice as there may be submissions by members who do not wish their
contribution to be merged with other material. The material submitted might
not be content (in the sense of nodes, relations, axioms, etc.) but architecture,
structural considerations, tutorial materials, tools, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My main concern is not the name; it is that there be no difference in status
of any documents that are or will be listed.
<p><sup><font color="#FF0000">2</font></sup><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
I think it would be appropriate to list the duties of a technical editor
in a footnote to the motion.&nbsp; Some obvious duties occur to me (maintaining
a current version, logging issues, facilitating the resolution of issues
etc.), but I would appreciate suggestions.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><sup><font color="#FF0000">3</font></sup><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
I have tried to accommodate John Sowa's (and others) suggestions about
the types of membership and their privileges regarding document submissions.&nbsp;
The motion requires a voting member to submit a document, either a voting
member or a candidate member may serve as editor and non-members may apply
and wait for membership or&nbsp; alternatively persuade a voting member
to make the submission.&nbsp; This might eliminate the contribution as
editor of people who are subscribers to the list, but do not desire voting
privileges.&nbsp; I can accept either form, but invite comments if anyone
feels strongly either way.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><sup><font color="#FF0000">4</font></sup><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
Regarding filters to screen out "crank" submissions, I have adopted Matthew's
suggestions.&nbsp; Since one has to be a voting member for their submission
to merit any consideration this would seem to serve as an effective screen
for "crank" submissions.&nbsp; It is hard to see how any real harm could
result from a submission that is silly, out of the scope of the group,
etc.&nbsp; If the submission's language is obscene, contains spam or is
otherwise offensive a simple vote on whether or not it should be removed
is appropriate and can be done quickly.&nbsp; I accept Matthew's view that
considering the limited membership that may submit, it is better to deal
with exceptions than to apply a review process to all documents.&nbsp;
(Of course, most of the world would consider all of the members of this
group as cranks ;-)</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">I have tried to accommodate the suggestions that
have been made.&nbsp; If I have omitted some or you think of others please
comment (particularly on the duties of a technical editor).&nbsp; I will
wait a few days for other comments (not everyone reads the list every day).&nbsp;
If there are none, I will move for adoption by general consent.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Thanks for your advice and counsel.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
