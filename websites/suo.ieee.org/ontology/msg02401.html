Jon, I seem to remember that Peirce had a definition of "determination" which went
like: to determine is to cause something to not be what it could have been
otherwise. In the case of the sign, object and interpretant, you have to consider
their respective forms. Choose the form of O and it will cause the form of S to not
be what it could have been, had O not been what you chose it to be;. idem with I.
For instance a priman in O can only determine a priman in S; a secundan in O can
only determine a secundan or 2 primans in S, etc....

&gt;
&gt; I think that I have now done a sufficient amount of homework
&gt; on the meaning of "determination" to allow that facet of the
&gt; sign definition to rest for a while.  In hopes of being able
&gt; to pave the way of my extensional approach to sign relations
&gt; a little better, here is a part of an essay that I wrote way

&gt; Jon Awbrey, September 1, 1992
&gt;
&gt; 1.2.2.3  Pragmatic Theory of Signs
&gt;
&gt; The theory of signs that I find most useful was developed
&gt; over several decades in the last century by C.S. Peirce,
&gt; the founder of modern American pragmatism.  Signs are
&gt; defined pragmatically, not by any essential substance,
&gt; but by the role they play within a threeÄpart relationship
&gt; of signs, interpreting signs, and referent objects.  It is
&gt; a tenet of pragmatism that all thought takes place in signs.
&gt; Thought is not placed under any preconceived limitation or
&gt; prior restriction to symbolic domains.  It is merely noted
&gt; that a certain analysis of the processes of perception and
&gt; reasoning finds them to resolve into formal elements which
&gt; possess the characters and participate in the relations
&gt; that a definition will identify as distinctive of signs.
&gt;
&gt; One version of Peirce's sign definition is especially useful for
&gt; the present purpose.  It establishes for signs a fundamental role
&gt; in logic and is stated in terms of abstract relational properties
&gt; that are flexible enough to be interpreted in the materials of
&gt; dynamic systems.  Peirce gave this definition of signs in his
&gt; 1902 "Application to the Carnegie Institution":
&gt;
&gt; | Logic is 'formal semiotic'.  A sign is something, 'A', which brings
&gt; | something, 'B', its 'interpretant' sign, determined or created by it,
&gt; | into the same sort of  correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with
&gt; | something, 'C', its 'object', as that in which itself stands to 'C'.
&gt; | This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than
&gt; | does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies
&gt; | during a lapse of time.  (Peirce, NEM 4, 54).
&gt; |
&gt; | It is from this definition, together with a definition of "formal",
&gt; | that I deduce mathematically the principles of logic.  I also make
&gt; | a historical review of all the definitions and conceptions of logic,
&gt; | and show, not merely that my definition is no novelty, but that my
&gt; | non-psychological conception of logic has 'virtually' been quite
&gt; | generally held, though not generally recognized.  (Peirce, NEM 4, 21).
&gt;
&gt; A placement and appreciation of this theory in a philosophical context
&gt; that extends from Aristotle's early treatise 'On Interpretation' through
&gt; John Dewey's later elaborations and applications (Dewey, 1910, 1929, 1938)
&gt; is the topic of (Awbrey &amp; Awbrey, 1992).  Here, only a few features of
&gt; this definition will be noted that are especially relevant to the goal
&gt; of implementing intelligent interpreters.
&gt;
&gt; One characteristic of Peirce's definition is crucial in supplying
&gt; a flexible infrastructure that makes the formal and mathematical
&gt; treatment of sign relations possible.  Namely, this definition
&gt; allows objects to be characterized in two alternative ways that
&gt; are substantially different in the domains they involve but roughly
&gt; equivalent in their information content.  Namely, objects of signs,
&gt; that may exist in a reality exterior to the sign domain, insofar as
&gt; they fall  under this definition, allow themselves to be reconstituted
&gt; nominally or reconstructed rationally as equivalence classes of signs.
&gt; This transforms the actual relation of signs to objects, the relation
&gt; or correspondence that is preserved in passing from initial signs to
&gt; interpreting signs, into the membership relation that signs bear to
&gt; their semantic equivalence classes.  This transformation of a relation
&gt; between signs and the world into a relation interior to the world of signs
&gt; may be regarded as a kind of representational reduction in dimensions, like
&gt; the foreshortening and planar projections that are used in perspective drawing.
&gt;
&gt; This definition takes as its subject a certain three-place relation,
&gt; the sign relation proper, envisioned to consist of a certain set of
&gt; three-tuples.  The pattern of the data in this set of three-tuples,
&gt; the extension of the sign relation, is expressed here in the form:
&gt; &lt;Object, Sign, Interpretant, Object&gt;.  As a schematic notation for
&gt; various sign relations, the letters "s", "o", "i" serve as typical
&gt; variables ranging over the domains of signs, objects, interpretants,
&gt; respectively.  There are two customary ways of understanding this
&gt; abstract sign relation as its structure affects concrete systems.
&gt;
&gt; In the first version the agency of a particular interpreter
&gt; is taken into account as an implicit parameter of the relation.
&gt; As used here, the concept of interpreter includes everything about
&gt; the context of a sign's interpretation that affects its determination.
&gt; In this view a specification of the two elements of sign and interpreter
&gt; is considered to be equivalent information to knowing the interpreting or
&gt; the interpretant sign, that is, the affect that is produced 'in' or the
&gt; effect that is produced 'on' the interpreting system.  Reference to an
&gt; object or to an objective, whether it is successful or not, involves
&gt; an orientation of the interpreting system and is therefore mediated
&gt; by affects 'in' and effects 'on' the interpreter.  Schematically,
&gt; a lower case "j" can be used to represent the role of a particular
&gt; interpreter.  Thus, in this first view of the sign relation the
&gt; fundamental pattern of data that determines the relation can be
&gt; represented in the form &lt;o, s, j&gt; or &lt;s, o, j&gt;, as one chooses.
&gt;
&gt; In the second version of the sign relation the interpreter
&gt; is considered to be a hypostatic abstraction from the actual
&gt; process of sign transformation.  In other words, the interpreter
&gt; is regarded as a convenient construct that helps to personify the
&gt; action but adds nothing informative to what is more simply observed
&gt; as a process involving successive signs.  An interpretant sign is
&gt; merely the sign that succeeds another in a continuing sequence.
&gt; What keeps this view from falling into sheer nominalism is the
&gt; relation with objects that is preserved throughout the process
&gt; of transformation.  Thus, in this view of the sign relation the
&gt; fundamental pattern of data that constitutes the relationship
&gt; can be indicated by the optional forms &lt;o, s, i&gt; or &lt;s, i, o&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; Viewed as a totality, a complete sign relation would have to consist
&gt; of all of those conceivable moments -- past, present, prospective, or
&gt; in whatever variety of parallel universes that one may care to admit --
&gt; when something means something to somebody, in the pattern &lt;s, o, j&gt;, or
&gt; when something means something about something, in the pattern &lt;s, i, o&gt;.
&gt; But this ultimate sign relation is not often explicitly needed, and it
&gt; could easily turn out to be logically and set-theoretically ill-defined.
&gt; In physics, it is important for theoretical completeness to regard the
&gt; whole universe as a single physical system, but more common to work with
&gt; "isolated" subsystems.  Likewise in the theory of signs, only particular
&gt; and well-bounded subsystems of the ultimate sign relation are likely to
&gt; be the subjects of sensible discussion.
&gt;
&gt; It is helpful to view the definition of individual sign relations
&gt; on analogy with another important class of three-place relations
&gt; of broad significance in mathematics and far-reaching application
&gt; in physics:  namely, the binary operations or ternary relations that
&gt; fall under the definition of abstract groups.  Viewed as a definition
&gt; of individual groups, the axioms defining a group are what logicians
&gt; would call highly non-categorical, that is, not every two models are
&gt; isomorphic (Wilder, p. 36).  But viewing the category of groups as
&gt; a whole, if indeed it can be said to form a whole (MacLane, 1971),
&gt; the definition allows a vast number of non-isomorphic objects,
&gt; namely, the individual groups.
&gt;
&gt; In mathematical inquiry the closure property of abstract groups
&gt; mitigates most of the difficulties that might otherwise attach
&gt; to the precision of their individual definition.  But in physics
&gt; the application of mathematical structures to the unknown nature
&gt; of the enveloping world is always tentative.  Starting from the
&gt; most elemental levels of instrumental trial and error, this kind
&gt; of application is fraught with intellectual difficulty and even
&gt; the risk of physical pain.  The act of abstracting a particular
&gt; structure from a concrete situation is no longer merely abstract.
&gt; It becomes, in effect, a hypothesis, a guess, a bet on what is
&gt; thought to be the most relevant aspect of a current, potentially
&gt; dangerous, and always ever-insistently pressing reality.  And this
&gt; hypothesis is not a paper belief but determines action in accord with
&gt; its character.  Consequently, due to the abyss of ignorance that always
&gt; remains to our kind and the chaos that can result from acting on what
&gt; little is actually known, risk and pain accompany the extraction of
&gt; particular structures, attempts to isolate particular forms, or
&gt; guesses at viable factorizations of phenomena.
&gt;
&gt; Likewise in semiotics, it is hard to find any examples of autonomous
&gt; sign relations and to isolate them from their ulterior entanglements.
&gt; This kind of extraction is often more painful because the full analysis
&gt; of each element in a particular sign relation may involve references to
&gt; other object-, sign-, or interpretant-systems outside of its ostensible,
&gt; initially secure bounds.  As a result, it is even more difficult with
&gt; sign systems than with the simpler physical systems to find coherent
&gt; subassemblies that can be studied in isolation from the rest of the
&gt; enveloping universe.
&gt;
&gt; These remarks should be enough to convey the plan of this work.
&gt; Progress can be made toward new resettlements of ancient regions
&gt; where only turmoil has reigned to date.  Existing structures can
&gt; be rehabilitated by continuing to unify the terms licensing AI
&gt; representations with the terms leasing free space over dynamic
&gt; manifolds.  A large section of habitable space for dynamically
&gt; intelligent systems could be extended in the following fashion:
&gt; The images of state and the agents of change that are customary
&gt; in symbolic AI could be related to the elements and the operators
&gt; which form familiar planks in the tangent spaces of dynamic systems.
&gt; The higher order concepts that fill out AI could be connected with the
&gt; more complex constructions that are accessible from the moving platforms
&gt; of these tangent spaces.

&gt;
&gt; Maybe this will supply us with something more concrete to
&gt; talk about in regard to sign relations, extensional style.
