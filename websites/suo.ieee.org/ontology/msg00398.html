&gt; SUO Voters,

&gt; 	The definition posted for Base Document appears to be the cause of
&gt; some confusion.  Since IEEE does not provide a definition, we are free to
&gt; define it ourselves.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	How does this look?

In ISO, NCITS, IEEE, IETF, and elsewhere (Open Group, CommerceNet), the term "base document" is used consistently ... this definition is consistent with our original definition of a "base document".  Here's some URLs (search for "base document" once the page is opened):

&gt; Base Document:  Document a standards working group has agreed to work on.
&gt; Viewed at having potential for successful completion.  Has no official
&gt; weight (not a standard). Might not be in standards wording. Might contain
&gt; only small faction of planned content and scope. Might be multiple base
&gt; documents. Most base documents represent substantial work created outside
&gt; committee and introduced into the WG.  Changes to base document require
&gt; approval of group. 

The above definition describes a Working Draft (a base document is usually Working Draft 1).  I don't recommend that we use the above definition for Base Document.

Once a Base Document (in its original definition) is revised, it is no longer a Base Document, Revised Base Document, etc. -- it is now Working Draft 2.

A Base Document, as stated below, carries no official weight.  Just like a Working Draft: it carries no official weight.  The only implication for Working Drafts (which include Base Documents) is that the Working Group has agreed to work on improving the document towards developing a standard.  Changes to Working Drafts (which include Base Documents) are under committee control, i.e., by committee vote.

In many cases, the final standard is substantially different than the Base Document: the original document might only by 15-20% of the final standard, the document may be completely reorganized.

In many other standards activities, when a group is starting and many people aren't familiar with the standards process, they get a bit worried that things are moving too quickly.  In virtually all of these committees, everyone got caught up on the term "base document" because they thought (like participants in this Working Group) that it carried some official weight (it doesn't).

Later on, as more standards were developed in these other standards activities, virtually everyone felt comfortable with "base documents" because they recognized that (1) the work must begin as some point, and (2) the standards process allowed everyone to get all their comments incorporated ==&gt; not much to worry about on "base documents" (that is, assuming one is working constructively and positively toward developing a standard).

One reason for designating a working paper as a Base Document is that it is identified as a starting point, i.e., one does not need to provide Rationale (informative standards wording) for words prior to a Base Document.  Right now we don't need to worry too much about Rationale, but later on in the standards development we might consider publishing a Rationale as an Annex or a separate document.  Since we have a fine E-mail reflector to record every comment we make, we don't really need to concern ourselves now ... but a year or two from now, we will need to understand (roughly) where the starting point(s) began.

I'm suggesting we keep the original definition:

&gt; The prior definition was:
&gt; 
&gt; base document: Starting point for standards words (it's clear the document
&gt; *can* be transformed into standards words). Has no official weight (not a
&gt; standard). Might not be in standards wording. Might not be complete with
&gt; respect to the scope and/or final standard. Might be multiple base
&gt; documents. Automatically allocated agenda time since this is the main
&gt; product of the WG. Most base documents represent substantial work created
&gt; outside the committee and introduced into the WG.
