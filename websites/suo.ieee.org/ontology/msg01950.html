Jon,

Let me go back to good, old Peircean pragmaticism and explain
the primary implication of my definition of "proposition",
which is, I believe, of extreme importance to many practical
problems having to do with the SUO, the semantic web, and
many related issues in computational semeiotic.

On the SUO list, we have been discussing the KIF language,
the CG language, various versions of controlled natural
languages, such as ACE, and various stripped-down versions
of logic designed for the WWW, such as RDF, OIL, DAML, etc.

Each of these languages has its own peculiar syntax, but it
is a highly desirable, even the primary purpose of the SUO to
facilitate the transfer of information from one to the other
that satisfies the following four requirements:

 1. Invertible:  If sentence s1 expressed in language L1 is
    translated to a sentence s2 in language L2, it should be
    possible to translate s2 to a sentence s3 in L1.

 2. Proof preserving:  The sentence s3 in language L1 should
    either be identical to the original sentence s1 or it
    should be provably equivalent (in the sense of "if and
    only if") according to whatever rules of inference are
    used in language L1.
    
 3. Vocabulary preserving:  The nonlogical vocabulary (i.e.,
    the "content" terms) of the sentences s3 and s1 should be
    the same or synonymous (i.e., if t1 in s1 is replaced by
    t3 in s3, there should be some definition in L1 that says
    that t1 is a synonym for t3).

 4. Structure preserving:  When s1 and s3 are converted to
    Peirce Normal Form (with negation, conjunction, and the
    existential quantifier as the only logical operators),
    the number of negations and quantifiers is the same, and
    they are nested in isomorphic syntactic patterns.

These are the four requirements for what I called "meaning-
preserving translations".  For a refresher, following is
the excerpt from Ch 5 of my KR book in which I define and illustrate the definitions:


   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/logic/meaning.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/logic/meaning.htm</A>

The purpose of those translations is to enable us to give
a formal and efficiently computable definition of what it
means for two sentences in different formal languages to
"mean the same thing".  For the sake of the traditional use
in logic over the past 700 years (see, for example, Peirce's
comments about the ethics of terminology), I call that "thing"
a proposition.  So far, nothing you have said has indicated
to me that there is anything wrong with either (1) the goal
that needs to be addressed or (2) my proposed way of reaching
that goal.

Your primary objection seems to be to my choice of the word
"proposition" for the "meaning of a sentence".  However,
nothing you have said convinces me that there is anything
wrong with my choice.  Nor have you showed how anything that
you are doing would satisfy the four requirements that I
was trying to address.

Some comments:

&gt;It is, of course, far more efficient to carry out all
&gt;of the needed transformations on the pointer-structure
&gt;rather than on the text string, so it is convenient for
&gt;practical purposes to recognize the resulting parse-graphs,
&gt;much like the function of diagrams in mathematical thinking,
&gt;as a theoretically respectable species, family, clan of signs.

Yes.  I would say that the graphs represent just one more
formal language, which could be added to the list mentioned
in the second paragraph of my note above.

&gt;So, just the way I see things, and was able to teach a computer to do so,
&gt;a name like "g", an expression like "((p(q))(q(s))((pq(rs))))", and a graph

&gt;like the one shown above are all just as capable, given a suitable interpreter

&gt;to bring them to life, of being the signs of this sort of more or less abstract,

&gt;formal, ideal, logical, mathematical object that most folks...

Which folks?  I use the term "proposition" in the way I defined
above.  If there are any folks who need education, please ask
them to read my KR book.

&gt;1.  p = paitrick, q = quail,   r = rooster,   s = sandpiper.
&gt;2.  p = particle, q = quantum, r = radiation, s = static.
&gt;3.  p = person,   q = quorum,  r = rule,      s = standard.

Please note requirement #3 of vocabulary preserving.  When
you translate from L1 to L2, the words may change, but when
you translate back to L1, you must recover exactly the same
vocabulary (or something defined to be synonymous).

John Sowa
