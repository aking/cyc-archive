In the ongoing dicussion between Pat and Ian,
I have decided to attempt to slice a tiny part of their issues and
see if we can start a separate thread on the issue of axioms for 
granularity. First, the discussion in progress.

Pat Hayes said:
 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The explanation for continuousObject does not make sense. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; starts "A ContinuousObject is an object in which every part is
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar to every other in every relevant respect." which is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; contradiction in itself, since some parts presumably contain other
&gt; &gt; &gt; parts as parts.

Ian Niles answered:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This would be a contradiction only if one assumed that the relevant respects
&gt; &gt;apply to all of the parts of the original parts, and I am not making this
&gt; &gt;assumption.  Generally speaking, when one distinguishes stuffs from objects,
&gt; &gt;one claims that the stuffs are stuff-like only at or above a certain level
&gt; &gt;of granularity, and, hence, parts of things at this level of granularity
&gt; &gt;will not be stuff-like.

Pat Hayes replied:
&gt; 
&gt; But that is not what the text I cited says. It says "..in which EVERY 
&gt; part is similar...".  My point wasnt about the granularity issue, but 
&gt; about the fact that a part is not similar to the whole of which it is 
&gt; a part in every respect.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, that idea of "down to a certain level of granularity" is 
&gt; a fine aspiration for an ontologist, and everyone sees that we need 
&gt; it, but nobody has actually managed to do it. I don't know of anyone 
&gt; who has axiomatized the idea satisfactorily (yet). The nearest is 
&gt; Jerry Hobbs, and he had to hack round the basic problem by assuming 
&gt; that approximation is transitive (which of course it isnt, as every 
&gt; engineer, builder and carpenter knows in detail.) Ive been trying to 
&gt; do this, on and off, for about 30 years and I havnt managed it yet, 
&gt; but I do have a very finely honed sense of how not to do it and why 
&gt; all extant ideas don't work.
&gt; 
&gt; The central problem is that the heap paradox has a very nasty 
&gt; interaction with logical inference: it violates the transitivity of 
&gt; correctness.  About every decade or so someone publishes a paper 
&gt; about granularity or approximation which fails to solve the basic 
&gt; problem.
&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; You are relying on this notion of granularity to do a lot of your 
&gt; work here. I would urge caution, since you will have a very hard time 
&gt; cashing out this intellectual loan.

the heap paradox, as i understand it, says something like:

Assume you have a heap of sand, and start the process of removing
one grain of sand at a time from that heap.

When you have a trillion grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
As the process continues, you have a smaller and smaller heap.
When you have a million grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
As the process continues, you have a smaller and smaller heap.
When you have a ten thousand grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
As the process continues, you have a smaller and smaller heap.
When you have a few hundred grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
Suddenly as the process continues, you don't have a heap left,
but just a a few grains.

This paradox has a temporal analogue as well.
lets say you have a film of a man walking from New York to L.A.
(admittedly a very long film).  I am going to refer to the film
for clarity, but the actual process of walking is what I'm going
to say has heap-like aspects.
As you shorten the film from a trip to L.A. to a trip from the front
door to the first stop-light, the temporal heap-like aspects lessen.
eventually, you don't have a heap of walking, but just a few steps.

Now it seems to me that this change from heap-ness to non-heapness
is very similar to the change from countable sets to finite sets.
According to my understanding, it is impossible to say that
a set is finite using only First order predicate logic.

So approaching this from that perspective would be ill-advised.

However this issue seems to be related to limits too, so maybe
it will be necessary to meet it head-on.

The change-over from heap-ness to non-heap-ness seems to be 
related to 'size'. When the size of the heap gets within a
a few orders of magnitude of the size of the granules, 
the change-over occurs.

So what seems to be necessary for the axioms
is a general idea of a heap of something,
a general idea of the size of the heap of something,
a general idea of the granule of something,
a general idea of the size of the granule of something,
a general idea of order of magnitude between sizes,
and the idea of adding a granule to a heap, or removing one.

So what are the problems with this process of axiomizing?

David
