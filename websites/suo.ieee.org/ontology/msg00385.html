Pat and John,

&gt; Subject: Re: SUO: Vote on Merged Ontology as a 'Base Document' for SUO
&gt; WG
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I endorse Pat Hayes' vote:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I vote NO.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Comments: I don't mean to denigrate Niles' hard work, but it is 
&gt; &gt;ridiculously premature to adopt this (or anything else like this) as 
&gt; &gt;a base document. This document doesnt even come close to the 
&gt; &gt;requirement for a base document given in the accompanying text.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with Pat that Niles has done some hard work in putting
&gt; together the work of several other people whose efforts have
&gt; been merged (including some of my own).  But the act of
&gt; translating those independent collections of axioms into a
&gt; common notation does not cause them to be integrated.

I agree that reformulating a bunch of different ontologies in the same
syntactic notation is not very useful.  However, what I have offered to the
group in both versions of the merged ontology goes way beyond this.  It
attempts to integrate the SUO sources into the same semantic base by linking
their primitive concepts into a simplified version of your (John Sowa's)
upper-level ontology.  If you could point to some examples where I have
failed to do this sort of alignment or have done it incorrectly, I could use
this information to produce an ontology whose concepts are better
integrated.

&gt; 
&gt; Pat continues:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It has no overall coherent ontological model; it represents 
&gt; a melange 
&gt; &gt;of conflicting and incommensurate views on many basic 
&gt; ontological issues.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with the first line above, but I disagree with the
&gt; second line that those collections are "conflicting".  On the
&gt; contrary, they are consistent with one another for the very
&gt; simple reason that they are unrelated to one another.  Whether
&gt; they become "conflicting and incommensurate" would depend on
&gt; how they are used together.  But the really hard work involves
&gt; determining how or when they could or should be used together. 

I don't agree that the merged ontologies are conflicting or unrelated to one
another.  As I mentioned above, I have tried to tie all of them into a
simplified version of your (John Sowa's) upper-level ontology.  If you can
indicate to me where I have failed to relate (part of) a merged ontology to
the superstructure, I will revise the document accordingly.

&gt; 
&gt; I agree with the general tenor of Pat's further criticisms,
&gt; but there is much more to be said about the details of the
&gt; issues involved:

I agree, but without detailed comments/criticisms, I have no basis for
correcting/extending the original two versions of the document.  

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Its axioms have no global coherence (for example: the 
&gt; &gt;intended meaning of the quantifiers varies from one place to another 
&gt; &gt;in the document; later axioms do not conform to the categories 
&gt; &gt;introduced in the earlier axioms; many, if not most, of the major 
&gt; &gt;classifications depend on questionable and controversial 
&gt; philosphical 
&gt; &gt;presuppositions.) It fails to address many of the basic ontological 
&gt; &gt;issues that ned to be got clear before we can put any ontology to 
&gt; &gt;practical use (how to represent time and change, how to deal with 
&gt; &gt;alternative courses of reality, for example. ) Moreover, it is clear 
&gt; &gt;that the more 'pieces' are added to it, the more these problems are 
&gt; &gt;going to get worse rather than better.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This methodology is fundamentally flawed. There is no way to achieve 
&gt; &gt;a coherent ontology by 'merging' axioms from incommensurate 
&gt; &gt;ontological perspectives in this simplistic way. It is rather like 
&gt; &gt;trying to create a large piece of software by just adjoining pieces 
&gt; &gt;of code written by different authors in different computer 
&gt; languages, 
&gt; &gt;and expecting it to magically work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Apart from the general issues of a lack of a coherent methodology, I 
&gt; &gt;have many particular problems with much of the actual content of the 
&gt; &gt;document. As it stands, the ontology it outlines would be unworkable 
&gt; &gt;for me for almost any practical purpose, even if it were globally 
&gt; &gt;coherent. But this is not the right place to go into details.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that Pat and I agree on one fundamental point:
&gt; much more work is needed on the foundations and methodology.
&gt; 
&gt; John Sowa
