&gt; What I believe you are forgetting is that the core of
&gt; natural languages, and of how human societies function,
&gt; are very stable, and strikingly similar, even from very
&gt; different roots.
&gt; 
&gt; The motility you speak is mainly around the edges.
&gt; We don't have to deal with that till much later.
&gt; 
&gt; If we can capture the stable core of information/knowledge
&gt; structures for interchange, we will still have something
&gt; to be proud of.

Graham,

I cannot imagine what it was in my initial note,
offered by way of proposing to Jim and the group
a parallel strategy for possibly productive work,
by focusing on problems rather than straw targets,
that evoked the tune of "Ord Lang Syne" in your mind.
But on that same theme, and to that same tune, let me
thank you for the trip down Memory Lane -- I took a look
at IDEF #5 at the site that you sent me -- <A  HREF="http://www.idef.com">http://www.idef.com</A> --
and it really has a lil' something for everyone, don't it, though!? --

| A little bit of EPAM in my life,
| A little bit of ELINOR by my side. 
| A little bit of FRAN all I need, 
| A little bit of Flowchart all I see. 
| A little bit of EURISKO in the sun, 
| A little bit of STELLA all night long.

I am really looking forward to seeing the whole dog'n'pony act
on "Antique Roadshow" anytime soon.  You note that I have gone
back to being subtle.

More seriously, Graham, I kept up with just about
all of the new dance crazes that hit the charts
in AI, CogSci, Computational Learning, DataBases,
Discovery Programs (No, not the Disney Channel),
Language Design, Logic Programming, and all-around
Theory of Computation -- between 1982-1992, when
I finally got tired of the cyclic nature of most
of the fads and decided to go back to work on the
fundamental mathematical tools that it would take
to beat the band.

I do not like using the progressive fallacy jazz,
but you are the one who used the word "modern",
like so many do, as if it were a guarantee of
not only freshness, but truth and utility,
so I feel obligated to fight pop with pop.

The sample of the "IDEF Five" that I saw is
very typical of the the sort of hip hop mix
that I was very hype to in the middle Disco
years, and the very sort of thing that made
me quit the band.  But thanks for the LTM.

With respect to your off-key note on Nat Lang,
the thing that you have constantly ignored is
what every school child in formal linguistics
since the early days of Chomsky, if not before,
learns along with their *"See Spot Parse Puff"*,
to wit, that aside from the crucial distinction
between Competence and Performance, there is the
critical third party to the dance, the one that
really calls the tune, and that is what we might
call "Reflective Knowledge" of the language, such
as would be reflected in an explicit grammar for it,
which is, after all, when the party's over, just what
the Filed Linguist seeks, and what the Field Linguist
does not yet have.  Nor do we.

Jon Awbrey
