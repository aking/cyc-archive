I have waded through the collection of materials that you posted and indeed
can find one or two statements that resonate with my perception of
&quot;reification&quot; or &quot;hypostatic abstraction&quot; (they took some finding but then,
as you say &quot;JA: Four short paragraphs and I have already put myself to
sleep --&quot;!)

In particular:

| Intuition is the regarding of the abstract in a concrete form,
| by the realistic hypostatization of relations;  that is the one sole
method of
| valuable thought.  Very shallow is the prevalent notion that this is
something
| to be avoided.  You might as well say at once that reasoning is to be
avoided
| because it has led to so much error;  quite in the same philistine line of
| thought would that be;  and so well in accord with the spirit of
nominalism
| that I wonder some one does not put it forward.  The true precept is not
to
| abstain from hypostatization, but to do it intelligently ... (CP 1.383).
|
| Charles Sanders Peirce, &quot;A Guess at the Riddle&quot;, circa 1890,
| 'Collected Papers', CP 1.354-416.

and:

&quot;CP: CP 4.332  [Subjectal Abstraction = Hypostatic Abstraction]

    | ... The logical term 'subjectal abstraction' here requires a word
    | of explanation;  for there are few treatises on logic which notice
    | subjectal abstraction under any name, except so far as to confuse
    | it with precisive abstraction which is an entirely different logical
    | function.  When we say that the Columbia library building is 'large',
    | this remark is a result of precisive abstraction by which the man who
    | makes the remark leaves out of account all the other features of his
    | image of the building, and takes [to represent the size] the word
    | &quot;large&quot; which is entirely unlike that image -- and when I say the
    | word is unlike the image, I mean that the general signification
    | of the word is utterly disparate from the image, which involves
    | no predicates at all.  Such is 'precisive abstraction'.  But now
    | if this man goes on to remark that the largeness of the building is
    | very impressive, he converts the applicability of that predicate from
    | being a way of thinking about the building to being itself a subject
    | of thought, and that operation is 'subjectal abstraction'.  (CP
4.332).
    |
    | Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 4.332
&quot;

The RDF specification talks about reification in the following terms:

&quot;Statements are made about resources. A model of a statement is the resource
we need in order to be able to make new statements (higher-order statements)
about the modeled statement.

For example, let us consider the sentence

	Ora Lassila is the creator of the resource <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila">http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila</A>.

RDF would regard this sentence as a fact. If, instead, we write the sentence

	Ralph Swick says that Ora Lassila is the creator of the resource
<A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila">http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila</A>.

we have said nothing about the resource <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila">http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila</A>;
instead, we have expressed a fact about a statement Ralph has made. In order
to express this fact to RDF, we have to model the original statement as a
resource with four properties. This process is formally called reification
in the Knowledge Representation community. A model of a statement is called
a reified statement.&quot;

This seems to me to fit in with CSP's notion of 'subjectal abstraction', as
indeed does the usage in the case of XTM (Topic Maps).

In the case of XTM the use of the term 'reification' had been abandonned
because of its perceived general misuse.  It came back into use at the Paris
meeting (as indicated by Steve Pepper) because it appeared to more
accurately reflect what part of the conceptual model needed to say.  In a
topic map topics exist, but the subjects that they represent are themselves
abstract (although they may have physical manifestations).  We can form
associations between topics, we may also want to refer to some associations
between topics as if they were topics.  At a data modelling level this can
lead one to simply treat 'association between topics' as a subclass of
'topic'.  But this leads to problems, in particular it is not necessarily
appropriate to have an association inherit from topic because, in a general
case, properties of a topic are not all applicable in the case of an
association.  What it really comes down to is that the association can rank
alongside other subjects and can be converted to (or reified into) a topic.
The topic and the association are thus distinct and one is not a subclass of
the other.

To me the process of reification is that of converting a statement (which is
an abstraction) into a thing or entity in its own right in order that it may
become the subject of some other statement.  It is often the equivalent of
the device of placing a statement in single quotes in order to distinguish
between that part of a sentence that is in the metalanguage and that which
is in the object language.

Do you think that I am 'barking up the wrong tree'?

&gt; &gt; I am not clear whether you are simply making the point that the term
&gt; &gt; 'reification' has become rather overused and abused, or whether you are
&gt; &gt; stating that you believe it is being incorrectly applied in the case of
&gt; &gt; Topic Maps and XTM 1.0.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe that the intended usage in XTM is fully consonant with its
&gt; &gt; traditional usage in philosophy and linguistic semantics.  If you do
&gt; &gt; not agree perhaps you might like to explain why.

&gt; Chris,
&gt;
&gt; I have posted a collection of materials on the intertwined matters
&gt; of hypostatic abstraction, reflection, reification, subjecture, and
&gt; thematization, and I will post more later as I find it.  This ranges
&gt; from tidbits that I have collected over many years, to discussions
&gt; that I had last year on the Peirce, CG, SemioCom, and SUO Lists,
&gt; to links that I have run across more recently.  In character it
&gt; crosses the spectrum from standard definitions, as used in the
&gt; human sciences and philosophy, from hermeneutics to logic, to
&gt; my own ideas worked out in dialogue, to recent uses in web
&gt; and computer science settings.  My sense that the words in
&gt; question have begun to be corrupted in their meaning is an
&gt; impression that I get from what I hear a whole lot of folks
&gt; saying of late, and not from what might be writ in specs.
&gt; It is prefectly possible that there remains a common wit
&gt; here that is yet to be saved, but the odds are against it
&gt; from what I have seen.
&gt;
&gt; The place of &quot;hypostatic abstraction&quot; (HA) in forming the creation
&gt; of formal objects and mathematical ideas is an especially important
&gt; topos for me to defend.  No doubt it is destined to be my Alamo,
&gt; under any name.
&gt;
&gt; Let me know if any of these notes resonate with your own
&gt; sense of what is crucial in the concept of reification.
