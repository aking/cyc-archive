Dear Chris,

Thanks for the new set of responses.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello Matthew, thanks again for your comments.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I feel rather like someone who has just been given the answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (which we all know is 42) but not the question.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have the same feeling about every other proposed 
&gt; ontology?  If
&gt; &gt; &gt; not, why not?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Well not what we are about to produce as ISO15926-2. 
&gt; This will be
&gt; &gt; essentially the EPISTLE Core Model V4.0, with a variation of "some
&gt; &gt; notes on the nature of things" tacked on the front. The EPISTLE Core
&gt; &gt; Model gives the reference version (similar to your ontology) whilst
&gt; &gt; the introductory material explains what we were trying to 
&gt; achieve and
&gt; &gt; about some key choices we made and why, and a little about 
&gt; how it can
&gt; &gt; be used.
&gt; 
&gt; Fair enough.  It is good to provide lots of introductory material to
&gt; supplement axioms.  But this was a posting of an evolving, working
&gt; ontology to a *discussion list*.  Moreover, the front matter to the
&gt; document I sent out along with all the documentation statements go at
&gt; least some some distance toward providing introductory material.  I
&gt; suspect people differ greatly as to how much of this they like/need.

MW: I'm sure you are right about this. You will gather I am a little 
bit more man.

&gt; From what I see of the Core Model, however, it seems to me that you
&gt; might be guilty of the opposite error:  Lots of background, 
&gt; explanation,
&gt; and examples, but not much in the way of axiomatic content beyond a
&gt; simple inheritance hierarchy.  For example, it might be all well and
&gt; good in principle to tell us that "a &lt;class&gt; is a &lt;thing&gt; that is an
&gt; understanding of the nature of things".  However, I think this sort of
&gt; thing hinders more than it helps -- a class is an 
&gt; *understanding*?  Just
&gt; what sort of thing is an understanding?  I don't mean to be bashing
&gt; the work here (though it certainly can use some tightening-up).  The
&gt; point is that I'd much rather just see just your theory of 
&gt; classes and a
&gt; semantics for your language than to try to slog my way through a bunch
&gt; of natural language explanations like that one.

MW: You are completely correct. It is precisely this criticism of what we
are sensibly able to do in an entity-relationship environment that brings 
me here. Even the English definitions are lacking due to time constraints.
Suggestions fro improvements are welcomed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure what you're asking for, Matthew.  The notions of class,
&gt; &gt; &gt; relation, number, and sequence are fundamental to ontology.
&gt; &gt; &gt; If they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be useful, they have to be axiomatized.  Here are some 
&gt; axioms for
&gt; &gt; &gt; review -- use them, criticize them, refine them, etc.  
&gt; Isn't that just
&gt; &gt; &gt; what we do in ontology?  What more are you looking for?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I'm looking for
&gt; &gt;  - A scope statement (what you have included and what you have
&gt; &gt;  excluded).
&gt; 
&gt; What do you mean by "included" and "excluded"?  Does a 
&gt; concept count as
&gt; included if you have an axiom that refers to it?  Is a 
&gt; concept excluded
&gt; if you don't axiomatize it?  But what if it is compatible with one's
&gt; axioms to add an axiom for it?  "Exclusion" is too strong for 
&gt; that.  Do
&gt; you have a theory of inclusion and exclusion?

MW: We are talking about informal material here so a theory would be
a bit over the top. Excluded simply means "not dealt with here" with no
commitment as to whether it will or will not be dealt with elsewhere.

Included means it is dealt with here and it would be axiomatized.

If it is referred to, I would expect either a reference to where it is
axiomatised, or a "to be done" acknowledgement.

However, I would accept that this much is a high standard to expect of 
an initial document (I can ask though).
&gt; 
&gt; By my lights, rather than asking ill-defined questions about inclusion
&gt; and exclusion, ask what terms are axiomatized, ask for the axioms, and
&gt; read the documentation.  It is clearly stated, in this case, that the
&gt; ontology axiomatizes classes, relations, integers and sequences and
&gt; necessary ancillary concepts.  I'm really not sure what else you want.

MW: I am really reflecting engineering design practice of developing a 
specification before building the product. If we are going to develop
the SUO in anything like a reasonable time we will have to build it in 
modules, where the modules are developed in parallel.

So hypothetically taking what you have done as an example, there should 
have been a short proposal outlining what you were going to do and its
boundaries/interfaces. Others might do the same in other areas, and thus
reduce the risk of duplicating the work of others, whilst being aware of 
its general shape.

I know I might seem over-critical, but this is actually because what you 
have done is sufficiently close to what I think we ought to be doing
that I think the gaps are worth drawing attention to.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This would have saved some of the questions I have asked below - and
&gt; &gt; others asking them.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, maybe it'll help when I read your questions below more carefully.
&gt; (Added later: it didn't help.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - A little something about rationale, approach and 
&gt; choices, e.g. why
&gt; &gt;  did you introduce @arg,
&gt; 
&gt; You mean, why did I introduce row variables?  Well, there's four
&gt; paragraphs on row variables there, including an explicit semantics for
&gt; them, but the simple answer is that they give KIF a great deal of
&gt; additional expressive power (noted at various points in the
&gt; documentation statements).

MW: I agree, but I don't think I was in the intended audience for them.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; what choices did you reject and why?
&gt; 
&gt; I really don't understand the question.  Do you mean I should 
&gt; have tried
&gt; to consider other kinds of variables besides row variables?  Why is it
&gt; not enough just to provide justification the apparatus I use?  Why
&gt; should I consider the apparatus I didn't use (unless there is some
&gt; widely used option that is explicitly rejected, perhaps)?

MW: Well there you have it. I didn't even know there wasn't some 
alternative.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why did you stop short of extensional classes?
&gt; 
&gt; Because people often talk about classes in a way that does not
&gt; presuppose extensionality.  Seems to me to be a good methodological
&gt; principle not to force a relatively simple issue when you 
&gt; don't have to.

MW: I'm beginning to understand this.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. You start by saying that instance-of is not 
&gt; required, and then in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the set theory bit go on to use it.  Is this habit?  Or are
&gt; &gt; &gt; we to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two ways to denote classification?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of folks like to use "instance-of".  It's there if 
&gt; you want it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but it's dispensable.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: OK. It would be worth saying this explicitly though (see above).
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, sure, in a complete document.  But, again, this is a discussion
&gt; group, not a journal.  It seems to me to me to be good to get 
&gt; relatively
&gt; stable documents out for comment.

MW: Yes I admit being picky. I am looking forward to the standard 
(different again from journal or discussion group). But also the
engineering issues.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm afraid this does not compute with me. I was also 
&gt; not aware of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demand for this (whose requirement is this? what are 
&gt; the benefits?)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one wants to develop an ontology that embodies a 
&gt; conception
&gt; &gt; &gt; of time on which the future is not determinate, and hence on which
&gt; &gt; &gt; there are past and present objects, but no determinate future
&gt; &gt; &gt; objects.  (Such a conception might be useful, say, in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; manufacturing system that has to calculate on the fly the 
&gt; number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of objects it is going to produce during any given run
&gt; &gt; &gt; depending on demand.)  On such a conception, the class of humans
&gt; &gt; &gt; grows moment by moment with each birth (or conception, or whatever
&gt; &gt; &gt; your criterion is for being human).  But if classes are 
&gt; extensional,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they don't "grow"; `human' picks out a different class with each
&gt; &gt; &gt; birth.  Now, maybe that's ok with you; maybe it's the way 
&gt; it should
&gt; &gt; &gt; be.  But there are, it seems to me, intuitions that warrant saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; that membership in the class of humans can change over time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Extensionality is omitted simply to for allow such a conception of
&gt; &gt; &gt; class.  Add extensionality if you don't like it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: OK - of course one of the benefits of a 4D approach is 
&gt; that all this
&gt; &gt; comes out in the wash, so extensional classes don't have a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; At the cost of loss of generality.  Your 4D approach forces a 
&gt; conception
&gt; of time on which one has to view the future as determinate.  

MW: No it doesn't. Indeed being able to cope with alternative plans 
for the future is a particular requirement, which is supported by
use of a possible worlds approach. If you look carefully at ECM 4.0
you will see that individual is really possible individual, and that
the actual ones are in the actual_individual subtype. Easily missed
I will grant though.

&gt; That's
&gt; exactly the kind of decision I don't think should be forced 
&gt; on users in
&gt; an ontology meant for general use, and I suspect that is likely to be
&gt; problematic in certain contexts.  Furthermore, your 4D 
&gt; approach doesn't
&gt; allow for the possibility that there could have been other things --
&gt; other humans, say -- than the ones that actually exist at some time or
&gt; other, since, by definition, the class HUMAN comprises just the actual
&gt; humans.  So if you ever need to add modality, your 4D extensional
&gt; classes are once again likely to be problematic.

MW: Same answer. Two of our stock examples for testing the model are
the Starship Enterprise (unlikely future object) and Sherlock Holmes
(fictional historical object).

MW: On the other hand I agree with having non-extensional classes if 
there are people who find them useful. It would be important though
to distinguish between an extensional "car" class and a non
extensional "car" class for instance, and understand the mapping 
between.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If classes are non-extensional then I presume 
&gt; membership can also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change over time.  There needs to be something that 
&gt; explains how you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get to the membership at some point in time.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure I understand the question, but it's irrelevant until
&gt; &gt; &gt; you add a temporality to the axioms somehow, either by introducing
&gt; &gt; &gt; temporal operators and an appropriate extension to the 
&gt; semantics or
&gt; &gt; &gt; an explicit theory of time.  If you do, then presumably you'd have
&gt; &gt; &gt; to add something like a temporal parameter to all predicates,
&gt; &gt; &gt; including instance-of, so that talks instead of being an 
&gt; instance-of
&gt; &gt; &gt; class C *at some time* t.  Is that what you're talking about?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: OK so temporality is out of scope for this piece of 
&gt; ontology (see
&gt; &gt; above).
&gt; 
&gt; What is the point of this hand-holding?  Why is it too much for you to
&gt; *look* at the axioms and *see* that there are no temporal 
&gt; operators and
&gt; that there is no theory of time, and hence that temporality is "out of
&gt; scope"?

MW: I did look, and I wondered why? Was this an ommission (something that
should have been included if it was to make sense) or something that had
been considered and deliberately left out because it could sensibly be 
added later. It turns out I read more into the lack of extensionality
than I should.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the other hand you needed to invoke temporality above to justify
&gt; &gt; non-extensional classes, so perhaps it should be in scope.
&gt; 
&gt; You are confusing the fact that classes are not asserted to be
&gt; extensional with the proposition that they are asserted not to be
&gt; extensional once again.  Extensionality is not required in order to
&gt; allow the ontology to be extended in either direction.

MW: Yes, that is something I misunderstood.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (please don't expect me to decifer the KIF).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever.  Though I don't understand why you wouldn't *want*
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be able to read it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I keep struggling with it, but I know from experience with data
&gt; &gt; models that languages like this are often missread by 
&gt; non-experts such
&gt; &gt; as myself.  Also the introducion of (to me) new elements like @args
&gt; &gt; means I have a new struggle to come to terms with what they mean and
&gt; &gt; how they can be used.
&gt; 
&gt; I devote a fair amount of informal discussion to the semantics of row
&gt; variables, and state their formal semantics explicitly.  How they are
&gt; used is illustrated throughout the document.

MW: Yes that has helped a lot. Again I appreciate I am bing picky, but
what youhave done is good enough to be picky about (now that'll teach
you :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. You have used the word sequence in a restrictive 
&gt; sense. There are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other sorts of sequence than number sequence. I suggest changing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sequence to number-sequence.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sequences are *functions* on numbers, but the numbers 
&gt; simply index the
&gt; &gt; &gt; elements of the sequence; they are what provide a notion 
&gt; of order.  To
&gt; &gt; &gt; be an element of a sequence s is to be the value of s on 
&gt; some positive
&gt; &gt; &gt; integer n.  But *anything* can be an element of a sequence.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the standard way of understanding sequences in set theory,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it is quite elegant, so I nicked it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: But there are sequences of activities as well, and I don't think
&gt; &gt; that is the same as set theory sequences since they aren't numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; You seem not to have believed me when I said that anything can be an
&gt; element of a sequence.  A sequence is an ordered n-tuple of things --
&gt; *any* things, including activities.  If that's not how you want to
&gt; understand what a sequence of activities is, then all you are doing is
&gt; quibbling over the word "sequence".  The word is widely used in logic
&gt; and mathematics to mean the sort of thing I have axiomatized.  If that
&gt; does not do as a representation of a sequence of activities, 
&gt; then one of
&gt; us has to use a different word.  (And you have to provide us with a
&gt; theory of activity sequences, not a bunch of English and a node in an
&gt; inheritance hierarchy.)

MW: I've had the chance to translate the KIF into English. There are still
some bits I don't fully understand but assuming that is just my ignorance,
I agree it should work for anything. My comment reflected what I read in
the documentation text.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10. I don't understand the last theorem about nth domain.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is a special case of the general axiom for nth-domain that
&gt; &gt; &gt; corresponds to its usual manifestation as a 3-place relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read all the stuff on arithmetic. I'll try to 
&gt; read that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a simple integer arithmetic for addition and subtraction.
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's all that's needed for the rest of the ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: OK, so its purpose was to provide the necessary basis 
&gt; for the rest
&gt; &gt; of the ontology. Useful information for the requirements/scope etc
&gt; &gt; piece I was asking for.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, that is obvious if one studies the ontology, though I 
&gt; admit that
&gt; it is useful to make such things explicit in introductory 
&gt; material -- in
&gt; an advanced working document, once again, not a post to a discussion
&gt; group.

MW: I guess it depends on what you are looking for, but again I plead
guilty to being picky.
