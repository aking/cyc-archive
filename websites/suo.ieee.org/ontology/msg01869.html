&gt; Some more questions and comments.

Appreciated, as always.  Thanks for the careful look.

&gt; 1. Under class, relation is defined as a class.

Yes, it is the class of relations.

&gt; Later under relation you define class as a unary relation.

Right, unlike, say, the OWNERSHIP relation, CLASS is not a relation that
holds among several things, but is true only of single things (namely,
classes).

&gt; This seems to be inconsistent.

It is quite consistent.  You seem to be confusing the claim that
RELATION itself is a class with the (false) claim that relations (i.e.,
the instances of the class RELATION) are classes.

&gt; 2. &lt; applies only to integers. Why doesn't it apply to reals or (at least)
&gt; rationals?

Reals and rationals are not axiomatized in the ontology, so, as in the
ontology as it stands, &lt; only holds between integers.  The axiom for &lt;
would have to be modified if you introduced further number systems and
you wanted &lt; to be polymorphic.

&gt; 3. &lt; is not defined (not that I have any idea how to do it). By which
&gt; I mean what being less than is.

What being less than *is* is exactly what the axioms tell us it is.
For primitive terms like "&lt;", this is what you get instead of a
definition.  (In a true definition, the defined term is eliminable;
anything expressed in terms of the defined term can be expressed without
it, albeit more verbosely, in terms of the primitives of the language.)

&gt; 4. I can't get the axiom for addition (or subtraction). Here is my attempt
&gt; at an English translation - where have I gone wrong?
&gt;
&gt; For all integers i and j
&gt;   i+0=0 and  &lt;-- I think this should be i+0=i

Whoops, yes, serious typo; thanks for catching that.

&gt;   i+(j+1)= i+j+1 and
&gt;   i+(j-1)= i+j+1

Don't confuse the sum of some number i and the number 1 with the
application of the (primitive) successor operator "+1".  The idea here
is to axiomatize addition and subtraction in terms of addition in terms
of the two successor "+1" and predecessor "-1".  (Maybe it would be
better to use, e.g., the terms "scssr" and "prdssr" or the like here for
these operators to avoid confusion.)  There are only three cases to
consider:

1. The case where we add 0 to a number i;
2. The case where we add the successor (+1 j) of a number j to i; and
3. The case where we add the predecesor (-1 j) of a number j to i.

The base clause (= (+ i 0) i) gives us the first case.  The clause

                (= (+ ?i (+1 ?j)) (+1 (+ ?i ?j)))

gives us case 2; it says that the sum of i and the successor of a number
j is the successor of the sum and i and j.  So if we know the sum of i
and j, we can calculate the sum of i and the successor of j.  Similarly,
case 3 is given by the last clause:

                 (= (+ ?i (-1 ?j)) (-1 (+ ?i ?j))))))

which says that the sum of i and the predecessor of a number j is the
predecessor of the sum of i and j.  Eventually, due to the recursive
nature of the axioms, you will be able to unpack any sum in terms of
a finite number of successive operations of successor and predecessor
(and hence,, in virtue of the Cancellation Axiom, successive operations
of *either* successor or predecessor only).  Try, for example, to show
that (= (+ 2 3) 5) (using the definitions of "2", "3", and "5" given).

&gt; phew so all those years using reverse polish notation on HP programmable
&gt; calculators did have a point :-)

And you thought that was wasted effort!

&gt; 6. Sequences
&gt;
&gt; a) Here you find a need to introduce extensionality for some classes like
&gt; sequence.

Sequences aren't classes, but yes, they are axiomatized to be extensional.
(They didn't *have* to be, but it is definitely simpler to make this
assumption.)

&gt; Robert has suggested they should also be necessary for Top, or else
&gt; there is no reason for Top to be unique.

I think we've cleared that one up.

&gt; It is starting to look to me as if it would be better to introduce a
&gt; "property" like class that can be non-extensional, and a "set" like class
&gt; that is extensional before we get to this point.

Quite possibly.

&gt; b) on the one hand you say that a sequence holds only for positive
&gt; integers, and on the other hand you say that any object can be an
&gt; element of a sequence. Which is it?

You are not understanding.  A sequence is a (partial) *function* (i.e.,
a binary relation that is functional) that *applies* to positive
integers and which can have *any object* as value.  The elements of a
sequence are its values on the integers on which it is defined.  We say
that a sequence s is defined on n iff, for some object x, (s n x), i.e.,
n bears s to x.

&gt; c)
&gt; (forall (?s)
&gt;         (=&gt; (sequence ?s)
&gt;             (and (relation ?s)
&gt;                  (binary ?s)
&gt;                  (functional ?s)
&gt;                  (exists (?n (posint n))  &lt;-- missing ?

Yes, thanks.

&gt;                          (and (not (exists (?x) (?s ?n ?x)))
&gt;                               (forall (?m (posint ?m) (&lt; ?m ?n))
&gt;                                       (exists (?x)
&gt;                                               (?s ?m ?x))))))))
&gt;
&gt; My translation is:
&gt;
&gt; For all s:
&gt;   If s is a sequence then:
&gt;     s is a relation and
&gt;     s is binary and
&gt;     s is functional and
&gt;     for some positive integer n
&gt;       there is no x such that s(n,x) &lt;-- doesn't seem to have
&gt;                                          a defined meaning

It most certainly does.  As discussed at some length, you can use a term
both as a predicate and as a function symbol; the context serves to
disambiguate what is meant.  Sequences are introduced as (functional)
binary relations.  Hence, s(n,x) means that the sequence s holds between
the number n and the object x.  Alternatively, one can write s(n)=x,
though, for reasons explained in the introductory material, one should
do so only when one knows that s is defined on n.

&gt;       and
&gt;       for all positive integers m where m&lt;n
&gt;         there is some x such that s(m,x) &lt;-- meaning?

As above.  Here's a terse English translation of the axiom:  if s is a
sequence, then it is a binary, functional relation that is defined on
some initial segment of the positive integers.  Here's a more verbose
version:  if s is a sequence, then it is a binary, functional relation
such that, for some positive integer n, s is defined on exactly the
positive integers less than n (i.e., for each such integer m, there is
an x such that s(m,x)).

&gt; c) you have used the term length to mean just the length of a
&gt; sequence. This means it cannot be used for e.g. length as a basic
&gt; dimension.

So let's use "seqlength" instead.  Let us not quibble.

&gt; Aren't what you are defining here as sequences really tuples?

Yes, it is a precise rendering of the notion of an n-tuple.  It is not
the only possible rendering, it is simply a good -- and common -- one.

Regards,

-chris
