&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Matthew, thanks for your comments.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. I feel rather like someone who has just been given the answer
&gt; &gt; (which we all know is 42) but not the question.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have the same feeling about every other proposed ontology?  If
&gt; not, why not?

MW: Well not what we are about to produce as ISO15926-2. This will be
essentially the EPISTLE Core Model V4.0, with a variation of "some notes on
the nature of things" tacked on the front. The EPISTLE Core Model gives the
reference version (similar to your ontology) whilst the introductory
material explains what we were trying to achieve and about some key choices
we made and why, and a little about how it can be used.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It would help greatly if you could document the requirements you are
&gt; &gt; trying to satisfy. This would mean we could check both that we could
&gt; &gt; check whether the requirements match our (individually and
&gt; &gt; collectively) requirements, and whether what you propose satisfies
&gt; &gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure what you're asking for, Matthew.  The notions of class,
&gt; relation, number, and sequence are fundamental to ontology.  
&gt; If they are
&gt; to be useful, they have to be axiomatized.  Here are some axioms for
&gt; review -- use them, criticize them, refine them, etc.  Isn't that just
&gt; what we do in ontology?  What more are you looking for?

MW: I'm looking for
 - A scope statement (what you have included and what you have excluded).
This would have saved some of the questions I have asked below - and others
asking them.
 - A little something about rationale, approach and choices, e.g. why did
you introduce @arg, what choices did you reject and why? Why did you stop
short of extensional classes?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. You start by saying that instance-of is not required, and then in
&gt; &gt; the set theory bit go on to use it.  Is this habit?  Or are 
&gt; we to have
&gt; &gt; two ways to denote classification?
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of folks like to use "instance-of".  It's there if you want it,
&gt; but it's dispensable.

MW: OK. It would be worth saying this explicitly though (see above).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. You have classes as non-extensional,
&gt; 
&gt; No, I just don't declare them to be extensional.  That's very 
&gt; different
&gt; from saying that the axioms assert them to be non-extensional.  If you
&gt; want extensionality, add it as an axiom.

MW: OK. Again worth saying this and why.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i.e. two classes can have the same membership but not be identical.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, in the sense that one could also posit this as an axiom.

MW: OK so strictly you were uncommitted to either extensional or
non-extensional classes (or both).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm afraid this does not compute with me. I was also not aware of a
&gt; &gt; demand for this (whose requirement is this? what are the benefits?)
&gt; 
&gt; Suppose one wants to develop an ontology that embodies a conception of
&gt; time on which the future is not determinate, and hence on which there
&gt; are past and present objects, but no determinate future 
&gt; objects.  (Such
&gt; a conception might be useful, say, in a manufacturing system that has
&gt; to calculate on the fly the number of kind of objects it is going to
&gt; produce during any given run depending on demand.)  On such a
&gt; conception, the class of humans grows moment by moment with each birth
&gt; (or conception, or whatever your criterion is for being 
&gt; human).  But if
&gt; classes are extensional, they don't "grow"; `human' picks out a
&gt; different class with each birth.  Now, maybe that's ok with you; maybe
&gt; it's the way it should be.  But there are, it seems to me, intuitions
&gt; that warrant saying that membership in the class of humans can change
&gt; over time.  Extensionality is omitted simply to for allow such a
&gt; conception of class.  Add extensionality if you don't like it.

MW: OK - of course one of the benefits of a 4D approach is that all this
comes out in the wash, so extensional classes don't have a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, note that I identify classes with unary relations, i.e.,
&gt; properties, and properties are not typically taken to be extensional.
&gt; Maybe that's not a good idea.  An option here would be distinguish
&gt; classes and properties, and take classes to be the extensions of
&gt; properties.  But I wonder if this is an unnecessary multiplication of
&gt; entities.

MW: Well in a 4D world properties are extensional classes, so I certainly
wouldn't want to distinguish them. In a 3D world I guess people will want
non-extensional classes because of the reasons you give above, so again no
need for a separation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, I don't mind as long as I can have classes that are
&gt; &gt; extensional - which are presumably a subset of the ones that aren't.
&gt; &gt; Could you explain how I can get there?
&gt; 
&gt; Add an extensionality axiom for classes.

MW: OK. Now overall I'm assuming we will need both, so that we can integrate
and translate between 3D and 4D viewpoints. They will be different things of
course.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If classes are non-extensional then I presume membership can also
&gt; &gt; change over time.  There needs to be something that explains how you
&gt; &gt; get to the membership at some point in time.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure I understand the question, but it's irrelevant until you
&gt; add a temporality to the axioms somehow, either by 
&gt; introducing temporal
&gt; operators and an appropriate extension to the semantics or an explicit
&gt; theory of time.  If you do, then presumably you'd have to add 
&gt; something
&gt; like a temporal parameter to all predicates, including instance-of, so
&gt; that talks instead of being an instance-of class C *at some 
&gt; time* t.  Is
&gt; that what you're talking about?

MW: OK so temporality is out of scope for this piece of ontology (see
above). On the other hand you needed to invoke temporality above to justify
non-extensional classes, so perhaps it should be in scope.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If classes are non-extensional then I don't see what point 
&gt; there is in
&gt; &gt; having null.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing in the axioms entails that there is a null class.  Null gives
&gt; us one with a name.  If you want, change the axiom to "There 
&gt; is an empty
&gt; class" and then when you add extensionality you can prove the 
&gt; existence
&gt; of null.

MW: OK.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since any class that had no members would have to be 
&gt; declared as such,
&gt; 
&gt; Why?  You mean you have to identify all the null classes in 
&gt; your domain?

MW: No. I was just quoting back what you said, that if you were interested
in saying that some class had no members, you wouldn't do it by equating it
to null.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. There are a number of relations that appear to be 
&gt; undefined. These
&gt; &gt; include: - documentation
&gt; 
&gt; The status of `documentation' is sort of funny.  I'm following
&gt; convention here by using it, but it really functions as a comment
&gt; mechanism.  But comments proper are not really what you want, because
&gt; you don't want it to be ignored by an ontology browser.  I admit I am
&gt; fuzzy on the status of `documentation'.

MW: At least I haven't missed anything. It would be nice to make it unfuzzy
sometime.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - instance-of
&gt; 
&gt; Think of it as "defined" by the axiom that says it is 
&gt; dispensable, i.e.,
&gt; 
&gt;   (&lt;=&gt; (instance-of ?x ?cls) (?cls ?x)).

MW: OK
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 5. Please can you give a bit more explanation about functional
&gt; &gt; relations?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what more I can say beyond the repeating the 
&gt; documentation
&gt; and the axiom for the "functional" predicate.

MW: I'm afraid it didn't quite reach me. I think I understand what you are
trying to do, but not quite how it works.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 6. I don't understand what unary is really about. Do you mean
&gt; &gt; singular, i.e.  there is only one member? Do you mean just 
&gt; one placed
&gt; &gt; relations (classes?) (though you say for n-tuples where n&gt;2, rather
&gt; &gt; than n&gt;=2)?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that is an unfortunate typo.  That should be "n&gt;1" (equivalently,
&gt; of course, "n&gt;=2").  Unary relations are classes -- but not 
&gt; all classes
&gt; are unary relations the way things are defined, as null 
&gt; classes are not
&gt; unary.

MW: Oh good - typo was my favourite resolution.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (please don't expect me to decifer the KIF).
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever.  Though I don't understand why you wouldn't *want* 
&gt; to be able
&gt; to read it.

MW: I keep struggling with it, but I know from experience with data models
that languages like this are often missread by non-experts such as myself.
Also the introducion of (to me) new elements like @args means I have a new
struggle to come to terms with what they mean and how they can be used.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 7. You documentation for ternary says it is documentation 
&gt; for binary.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 8. You have used the word sequence in a restrictive sense. There are
&gt; &gt; other sorts of sequence than number sequence. I suggest changing
&gt; &gt; sequence to number-sequence.
&gt; 
&gt; Sequences are *functions* on numbers, but the numbers simply index the
&gt; elements of the sequence; they are what provide a notion of order.  To
&gt; be an element of a sequence s is to be the value of s on some positive
&gt; integer n.  But *anything* can be an element of a sequence.  
&gt; This is the
&gt; standard way of understanding sequences in set theory, and it is quite
&gt; elegant, so I nicked it.

MW: But there are sequences of activities as well, and I don't think that is
the same as set theory sequences since they aren't numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 9. Signature looks much better than nth-domain, though I notice that
&gt; &gt; with the earlier changes you have made to KIF you can define even
&gt; &gt; Nth-domain,
&gt; 
&gt; No, nth-domain was never definable.  Rather, a metatheoretic *schema*
&gt; was given that defines infinitely many *instances* all at 
&gt; once.  But the
&gt; schema itself was not KIF.  To define it in KIF proper, you need
&gt; sequences and integers.

MW: Which you have now introduced, enabling you to define it (which is what
I meant).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; where it not being definable was my principal objection.  Why have
&gt; &gt; both?
&gt; 
&gt; No reason other than that nth-domain is fairly entrenched, so it was
&gt; important to show that it could be expressed.  I think the following
&gt; should fall out as a theorem that relates the two relations (WARNING!!
&gt; KIF AHEAD!! ;-) :
&gt; 
&gt; (forall (?rel ?n @args (= (arity ?rel) ?n))
&gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (signature ?rel @args)
&gt;              (forall (?m (posint ?m) (=&lt; ?m ?n))
&gt;                      (nth-domain ?rel ?m ([@args] ?m)))))

MW: OK, I'm still coming to terms with @args. You reinforce for me that
signature is a better approach.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 10. I don't understand the last theorem about nth domain.
&gt; 
&gt; It is a special case of the general axiom for nth-domain that
&gt; corresponds to its usual manifestation as a 3-place relation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I haven't read all the stuff on arithmetic. I'll try to read that
&gt; &gt; later.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a simple integer arithmetic for addition and subtraction.  That's
&gt; all that's needed for the rest of the ontology.

MW: OK, so its purpose was to provide the necessary basis for the rest of
the ontology. Useful information for the requirements/scope etc piece I was
asking for.
