Dear Robert,

I am also thinking of submitting the EPISTLE Core Model 
(as a start point for reference 4D ontology) and
the IIDEAS Architecture (as an architecture and methodology
for mapping/integrating different ontologies) as parts of what 
we need.

I think that the work that Chris Menzel has done, and what
you are proposing may fit as a layer above the EPISTLE Core
Model. Does that make sense to you?

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I have been thinking about submitting the Foundation 
&gt; Ontology, but it
&gt; looks like I need a couple more weeks. In the discussion 
&gt; below, I give an
&gt; overall picture of the ontological framework that I envision, 
&gt; I discuss some
&gt; of the conceptual problems being addressed, and I suggest a 
&gt; path for review
&gt; and editing. Because of my expanded response, I am cc-ing 
&gt; this to the list
&gt; at large.
&gt; 
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; The *overall picture* I have for an "industrial strength" ontological
&gt; framework goes is follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. There is a basic or core IFF ontology that interfaces the 
&gt; new KIF logical
&gt; language with the metalevel ontological framework. This would 
&gt; be close to
&gt; that expressed as Chris Menzel's Basic Ontology, but perhaps 
&gt; a bit simpler
&gt; since only a few things are needed -- class, subclass, 
&gt; function, signature,
&gt; pairing '[-]', and projections '(- 1)', '(- 2)' etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. There is a (rather large) metalevel (= structural level) 
&gt; ontology that
&gt; breaks up into two essential parts corresponding to the large/small
&gt; distinction in set-theoretic and category-theoretic foundations.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.1 The upper metalevel represents the "large" notion of 
&gt; foundations. This
&gt; is where the Foundation Ontology resides; the other 
&gt; components in this upper
&gt; metalevel are the Category Theory Ontology and the large 
&gt; Classification &amp;
&gt; Concept Lattice Ontology, the latter allowing us to represent 
&gt; the *truth
&gt; classification* and *truth concept lattice*, an overall goal for this
&gt; effort. The Foundation Ontology essentially represents 
&gt; set-theoretic classes
&gt; and their functions -- thus modeling the "large" notion of 
&gt; foundations.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.2 The lower metalevel represents the "small" notion of 
&gt; foundations. A
&gt; specific goal of the lower metalevel is to represent some 
&gt; central notions of
&gt; model theory -- models (first-order structures), expressions and
&gt; satisfaction. In the approach that I am suggesting, models 
&gt; are 2-dimensional
&gt; structures composed of small classifications along one 
&gt; dimension and small
&gt; hypergraphs (or spans) along the other; here classifications 
&gt; represent the
&gt; instance-type distinction, whereas hypergraphs represent the 
&gt; entity-relation
&gt; distinction. The lower metalevel makes heavy use of the upper 
&gt; metalevel --
&gt; indeed, a goal in modeling the lower metalevel is to abide by the
&gt; CATEGORICAL PROPERTY (see 
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02399.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02399.html</A>]).
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The object level is where the content ontologies reside. 
&gt; These could be
&gt; very generic, such as a 4D ontology, or specific, such as 
&gt; ontologies for
&gt; government or higher education. It should be noted that the 
&gt; object level
&gt; satisfies a representation property similar to the 
&gt; categorical property
&gt; satisfied by the lower metalevel -- the ontological language 
&gt; used is not
&gt; KIF; instead it is the terminology defined and axiomatized in 
&gt; the lower
&gt; metalevel (terms such as 'subtype', 'instance', 'expression', 'model',
&gt; 'ontology', 'relation', 'entity', 'role', etc.).
&gt; 
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a discussion of some of the *conceptual problems* 
&gt; being addressed:
&gt; 
&gt; One reason for the delay in submitting the Foundation Ontology is the
&gt; following. Initially, I had thought that the Foundation 
&gt; Ontology, which as I
&gt; mentioned above models set-theoretic classes and their 
&gt; functions, would
&gt; encode the axioms for a *Cartesian-closed category* (and that the Set
&gt; Ontology, which models small sets and their functions, would 
&gt; encode the
&gt; axioms for a *topos*). To test this I was using lower 
&gt; metalevel ontologies,
&gt; such as the Classification Ontology. But recently, in order 
&gt; to satisfy the
&gt; categorical property, I seemed to need "power classes" (see
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02381.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02381.html</A>]) in order to 
&gt; represent some
&gt; aspect of fibrations (specifically, the category of 
&gt; classifications and
&gt; infomorphisms is fibered over the category of sets and 
&gt; function along the
&gt; "instance functor"). See McLarty's suggestion to use 
&gt; Benabou's theory of
&gt; fibrations and definability
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/category/risc/catlist">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/category/risc/catlist</A>
&gt; /goedel-cat].
&gt; My current belief is that fibers can be represented in the Foundation
&gt; Ontology, without a full-blown representation of fibrations a 
&gt; la Benabou. In
&gt; order to do this however, we seem to require that the 
&gt; Foundation Ontology
&gt; encode the axioms for a *topos* (see McLarty's first order 
&gt; expression of the
&gt; theory of a well-pointed topos with natural numbers and choice
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9802/msg00072.ht">http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9802/msg00072.ht</A>
&gt; ml]. These
&gt; axioms are now incorporated in the Foundation Ontology. 
&gt; Perhaps this version
&gt; of the Foundation Ontology would partially satisfy Feferman's
&gt; representational needs, as expressed in the FOM list 
&gt; Toposy-turvey thread
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9801/msg00164.html">http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9801/msg00164.html</A>].
&gt; 
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; Here is one possible *path for review* and edit of the 
&gt; Foundation Ontology:
&gt; 
&gt; A. Submit to the SUO list for review, comments and criticisms. Beyond
&gt; set-theoretic critiques, also needed are comments about the 
&gt; new KIF and
&gt; concepts used from Chris Menzel's Basic Ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; B. Ask a select number of category-theorists to review. I 
&gt; have in mind the
&gt; following people:
&gt;     - Ross Street [<A  HREF="http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~street/">http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~street/</A>], a 
&gt; category-theorist
&gt; who seems to have some interest in applications (see his link 
&gt; to Category
&gt; Theory at The Boeing Company, which refers to the Specware software
&gt; mentioned by Michael Uschold 
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg00375.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg00375.html</A>]);
&gt;     - Colin McLarty 
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/mclarty.html">http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/mclarty.html</A>], who gave
&gt; the challenge topos axioms mentioned above, and has written a 
&gt; topos-theory
&gt; book "Elementary Categories, Elementary Toposes"
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.oup-usa.org./docs/0198514735.html">http://www.oup-usa.org./docs/0198514735.html</A>];
&gt;     - Bill Lawvere [<A  HREF="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/">http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/</A>], 
&gt; who is one of
&gt; the primary creators of topos theory, and whose interest in 
&gt; applications
&gt; (although a theorist) is indicated in the very detailed response
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://merwan.sunyerie.edu/~alsani/ctmail01-04,01/msg00014.ht">http://merwan.sunyerie.edu/~alsani/ctmail01-04,01/msg00014.ht</A>
&gt; ml] that he
&gt; gave to a question of Mike Healy's on the category list.
&gt; 
&gt; C. Submit to the category list at large for review, comments 
&gt; and criticisms.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any further thought of submitting the Foundation Ontology as a
&gt; &gt; starter document in SUO?  As you know, the group needs one or more
&gt; documents
&gt; &gt; to focus its efforts on.

&gt; &gt; Jim,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Possibly eventually -- not for merger with Ian's effort, but as an
&gt; &gt; alternative approach. However, the IFF Foundation Ontology 
&gt; is still being
&gt; &gt; worked on, with much feedback from several of the other IFF 
&gt; ontologies
&gt; such
&gt; &gt; as Spans, Categories, Sets and Classifications (there is a lot of
&gt; synergism
&gt; &gt; taking place right now). Although the fundamental idea is 
&gt; reasonably firm,
&gt; &gt; the KIF code (at the ontologos site
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.ontologos.org/IFF/IFF.html">http://www.ontologos.org/IFF/IFF.html</A>])
&gt; &gt; is still in a flux. Perhaps in a month or so it will stabilize.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Robert,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I forget if I've already asked you this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this Foundation Ontology something the SUO WG could use as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting point to develop a completed SUO document?  If 
&gt; so, would you
&gt; like
&gt; &gt; &gt; to discuss the option of submitting this as a starter 
&gt; document.  If so,
&gt; &gt; &gt; let's discuss some more.
