&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jim, 
&gt; &gt; 	.	This has turned into a suggested set of 
&gt; &gt; alterations to the SUO group methods of working. I
&gt; &gt; believe these are pragmatic ways of overcoming the
&gt; &gt; recent hiatus that has obstructed our  progress. 
&gt; &gt; You may like to consider the approaches suggested
&gt; &gt; below as ways of  improving the SUO development
&gt; &gt; process. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Matthew et al, 
&gt; &gt; 	.		I will provide a brief note, in 
&gt; &gt; numerical order, on each of the 3 e-mails below: 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	.	RE: #3 "Flawed Approach: So long as Ian Niles
&gt; &gt; is co-ordinating (and actually doing) the work, I suggest the 
&gt; &gt; structure of the basis is, de facto, under his control, taking
&gt; &gt; into account the input from the rest of us. If we get to a stage
&gt; &gt; where someone actually suggests a different structure
&gt; &gt; (absolute silence so far .......), and Ian rejects it on
&gt; &gt; a basis the majority of us disagree with, then this issue 
&gt; &gt; could be worth revisiting. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I think what I have been proposing as a set of deliverables is an
&gt; alternative approach that in particular involves putting the 
&gt; horses in front
&gt; of the cart.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	.	At present, Ian is showing worthwhile effort, 
&gt; &gt; and is genuinely adapting participants comments in a
&gt; &gt; reasonable way, including taking note when there is
&gt; &gt; reaction to solution paths he has developed in the
&gt; &gt; absence of guidance or when he has attempted to
&gt; &gt; rationalise things himself. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I am the last to denigrate Ian's effort. At a minimum it 
&gt; has raised the
&gt; issues we are now discussing. One of my own mottos is "if in doubt do
&gt; something", and Ian has, and as a result we have much useful 
&gt; evidence of
&gt; what we need to do.
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	Problem is that others are using such aspects as your 
&gt; comments as
&gt; grounds to try to undo his work. 

MW: I don't read it that way. I think most of the people voting against (and
some abstentions) have much the same position as me. The problem is not with
Ian's work (how much more could he have done from a standing start?). The
problem is with the status we were asked to accord what he has done, which
it does not yet merit. I have had much better documents than this rejected
for recycling and rework.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	.	An important aspect that Ian should
&gt; &gt; continue to do, is advising the group of every change
&gt; &gt; that he makes on his own  initiative, so that their
&gt; &gt; merits can be considered in the light of the breadth of
&gt; &gt; experience of the other group members. 

MW: I would not want to burden Ian at this stage with formal change control,
but something that makes it easy for readers to see what has changed between
versions would be pragmatically useful.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; &gt; 	.	I propose that Ian Niles be accepted as the 
&gt; &gt; co-ordinator and developer of the SUO content, on the
&gt; &gt; basis that no-one else is proposing or
&gt; &gt; offering to undertake the work. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This is a de facto situation for the work Ian is doing.
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	Of course, and I'd like to give it some formal recognition. 
&gt; 
MW: I am happy to recognise what he is doing, but I hope we will get to the
situation where there are several developers of several parts of the
content, which we can do if we work out how to engineer this thing, rather
than construct it monlithically.
