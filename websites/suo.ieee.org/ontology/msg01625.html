Dear John,

So "giving" is a mediator?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Pat,
&gt; 
&gt; As Karl Marx once said, "Je ne suis pas Marxiste."  There have
&gt; been people harping on triadic mysticism to the point where
&gt; they turn off many people inlcuding me (and if he were alive)
&gt; Peirce as well.  Let me try again to explain the point with
&gt; as little mysticism about threeness as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I only ever say it as a response to the endless repetition of a 
&gt; &gt;mantra about 'irreducible triadicity' by Peircian cultists.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;And such relabelling IS a reduction to binary relations. Whatever 
&gt; &gt;metaphysical significance y'all think it doesn't have, the fact 
&gt; &gt;remains that this is a perfectly well-defined transliteration of FOL 
&gt; &gt;into the sublanguage of FOL which uses only binary relation symbols 
&gt; &gt;(and if that isn't a reduction to dyads, I have no idea what a dyad 
&gt; &gt;is.)
&gt; 
&gt; Let's drop the term "reduction to dyad" along with the term
&gt; "irreducible triadicity" because they sound more high-falutin'
&gt; than they deserve to be.
&gt; 
&gt; To be as mundane and explicit as possible, let me take the
&gt; verb "give", which Peirce, Whitehead, and you have used as
&gt; an example, as in "John gave the book to Mary."  And let
&gt; us try to rephrase that sentence as a conjunction of other
&gt; English sentences, which involve no more than two of the three
&gt; entities "John", "Mary", and "the book" in any one sentence.
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  Is it possible to for any such conjunction of
&gt; sentences to capture the full meaning of the sentence
&gt; "John gave the book to Mary"?
&gt; 
&gt; For example:  "John dropped the book.  Mary picked it up."
&gt; 
&gt; This doesn't capture the transfer of ownership involved
&gt; in giving.
&gt; 
&gt; Example 2:  "John renounced ownership of the book.  Mary
&gt;    claimed ownership of the book."
&gt; 
&gt; This captures the change of ownership, but not John's
&gt; intention of having Mary rather than anyone else assume
&gt; ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; Example 3:  "John initiated an act of giving.  The giving
&gt;    had a book as object.  The giving had Mary as recipient."
&gt; 
&gt; This example does capture the three-way relationship, but
&gt; only by creating another entity "giving", which itself has
&gt; the open slots in its definition -- formally speaking,
&gt; any representation of "giving" must have "frame-like" or
&gt; "lambda-calculus-like" representation, which contains
&gt; three inner variables or slots.  Then each of the three
&gt; sentences instantiates one of those slots.
&gt; 
&gt; The only point that Peirce, Whitehead, and I have been trying
&gt; to make is that there are concepts in English, such as Give,
&gt; which cannot be defined without using a frame, a lambda
&gt; expression, or some such formal device that contains three
&gt; distinct slots, variables, boxes, or whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Those are things that I called "mediators" in my toplevel
&gt; ontology.  Furthermore, those mediators keep appearing and
&gt; reappearing whenever there is some kind of representation,
&gt; perception, intention, or context involved.
&gt; 
&gt; For Whitehead's discussion of the point (which has far less
&gt; mysticism than any of the other discussions you may have heard)
&gt; please go to Ch. 7 of his book _Concept of Nature_:

&gt; 
&gt; Then use the "find" option of your browser to search for
&gt; the word "cluster", which should take you to an excerpt
&gt; which starts on p. 150 and continues for several more pages.
&gt; Following is the beginning of that excerpt.
&gt; 
&gt; John
&gt; _______________________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; The difficulties which cluster around the relation of 
&gt; situation arise from the
&gt; obstinate refusal of philosophers to take
&gt; seriously the ultimate fact of multiple relations. By a 
&gt; multiple relation I
&gt; mean a relation which in any concrete instance of
&gt; its occurrence necessarily involves more than two relata. For 
&gt; example, when
&gt; John likes Thomas there are only two
&gt; relata, John and Thomas. But when John gives that book to 
&gt; Thomas there are three
&gt; relata, John, that book, and Thomas.
&gt; 
&gt; Some schools of philosophy, under the influence of the 
&gt; Aristotelian logic and
&gt; the Aristotelian philosophy, endeavour to
&gt; get on without admitting any relations at all except that of 
&gt; substance and attribute.
&gt; Namely all apparent relations are to be
&gt; resolvable into the concurrent existence of substances with 
&gt; contrasted attributes.
&gt; It is fairly obvious that the Leibnizian
&gt; monadology is the necessary outcome of any such philosophy. 
&gt; If you dislike pluralism,
&gt; there will be only one monad.
&gt; 
&gt; Other schools of philosophy admit relations but obstinately 
&gt; refuse to contemplate
&gt; relations with more than two relata. I
&gt; do not think that this limitation is based on any set purpose 
&gt; or theory. It
&gt; merely arises from the fact that more complicated
&gt; relations are a bother to people without adequate 
&gt; mathematical training, when
&gt; they are admitted into the reasoning.
&gt; 
&gt; I must repeat that we have nothing to do in these
&gt; lectures with the ultimate character of reality. It is quite 
&gt; possible that in
&gt; the true philosophy of reality there are only
&gt; individual substances with attributes, or that there are only 
&gt; relations with
&gt; pairs of relata. I do not believe that such is the
&gt; case; but I am not concerned to argue about it now. Our theme 
&gt; is Nature. So
&gt; long as we confine ourselves to the factors
&gt; posited in the sense-awareness of nature, it seems to me that 
&gt; there certainly
&gt; are instances of multiple relations between
&gt; these factors, and that the relation of situation for sense 
&gt; objects is one example
&gt; of such multiple relations.
