John --
   This comment should be read along with my reply
to Ian about the physical/abstract distinction.

 
&gt; PC&gt;I have mentioned previously that the creation of an "abstract"
&gt; &gt;category as disjoint from "physical" at the highest level is 
&gt; &gt; in my view unnecessry and highly undesirable, since it would 
&gt; &gt; preclude, for example, the creation
&gt; &gt;of a general concept "object" which subsumes both physical objects and
&gt; &gt;abstract objects.
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, there is a general type Entity, which subsumes
&gt; both physical and abstract.  Second, I would place the
&gt; Physical/Abstract distinction on the same level as many other
&gt; top-level distinctions.  There is no reason why Physical/Abstract
&gt; should be considered more fundamental than several other
&gt; distinctions that might be placed at the top level.
&gt; 
  "Entity" will not serve  to provide a class that contains
relations between object and attribute, or object and space.
This is described more fully in the reply to Ian.

   It may seem obvious, if one views anything non-physical
as abstract, that there is a dichotomy between physical
and abstract entities, and in this I fully concur.
The problem arises when one makes the notion of "abstract'
as an inheritable property, making it impossible to have 
physical entities that are subclasses of abstract objects.
For me, "abstract" is not an inheritable property, it is
merely another way of describing some entity which is 
not physical.  This description is not inheritable.
   The general rule should be, that dichotomous
or polychotomous disctinctions can be made if one
generates an ontology as a lattice, but by
making those distinctions, one does not necessarily 
attribute to an entity some inheritable property.


&gt; Space and time are not sets or collections.  Sets and
&gt; collections are representations.  Nothing physical can be
&gt; a representation, although it might be used to record a sign
&gt; of some representation (as a pencil mark may be used to
&gt; make signs that represent sets or collections or numbers).
&gt; 
    Well, I thought that there was general agreement that,
as in CYC, "collections" can be physical objects.
So then why can't other physical entities (space and time)
be collections?  More specifically, I had in mind that
any dimension of a space, or a space itself, can be 
represented as a collection of points, which may be 
infinite.


&gt; That is one reason why Lenat says that the upper level of
&gt; the Cyc ontology is not very important.  It is so totally
&gt; screwed up that there are no useful inferences that can be
&gt; derived from it.
&gt; 
  Yes, the upper level is not important if you have
only one middle level.  But if you have more than
one middle level, having only one upper level is critical 
for interoperability.  I'm not sure if your comment
above disagrees with this asseertion.


&gt; A general physical concept can only become abstract by removing
&gt; all physicality from it.  Generality and Abstraction are totally
&gt; orthogonal distinctions.
&gt; 
  I use the term "generalization" and "abstraction" to mean
precisely the same thing, to remove some attribute or
axiom from a definition of a concept to create a
concept that is less specific.  If these terms have
or should have distinct well-defined meanings, then
precise definitions of these terms would be helpful
for further discussion.

&gt; 
&gt; No.  There is too much here to criticize.  It would be better
&gt; if you suggested your distinctions one at a time, since every
&gt; one of them deserves a distinct thread that could take several
&gt; hundred e-mails to discuss.
&gt;
   The virtue in presenting a set of related concepts at one
time is to clarify the intended meanings of the main points
of interest, which in this case was my concern not to allow
an inheritable "abstract" property.  Your last phrase may
well be true, but if it is true for all concepts, this
project would seem doomed.


&gt; 
&gt; As I said before, the abstract/physical dichotomy is only one
&gt; of many distinctions that could be applied at the top level.
&gt; 
  Yes, it is and can.  The question to be decided is whether 
"abstract" must be an **inheritable** property of an entity, 
or merely a characterization of some entity not being physical.
The dichotomy, at any level, could be defined either 
way.  I think that making "abstract" inheritable
is totally unnecessary and creates problems that
can be avoided without any violence to the usual
intuitive notions of "abstractness".
