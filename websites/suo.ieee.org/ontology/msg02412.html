Dear Jon,

&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; | Mutt:  Oh look!  Alla the people look
&gt; |        just like tiny AND's from here!
&gt; |
&gt; | Jeff:  Those are tiny AND's, you silly gism!
&gt; |        We haven't even left the ground yet!
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  There seems to be a question of what
&gt;      "reduction of a triadic relation to dyadic relations"
&gt;      means to different people.  So using Jon's example of
&gt;      an AND truth table, here is what I mean.  I mean that 
&gt;      for any n-ary relation I can create a set of at most
&gt;      n binary relations from which the original n-ary
&gt;      relation can be created as a view.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I don't have skills in SQL but using Microsoft Access
&gt;      I was able to construct the following tables and a view
&gt;      definition based on them using the graphical tools of Access.
&gt;      The SQL presented below is an output from this.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Here are the results:
&gt; 
&gt;      Truth_Value_Table
&gt;      o------------o
&gt;      |Truth_Value |
&gt;      o------------o
&gt;      |False       |
&gt;      |True        |
&gt;      o------------o
&gt; 
&gt;      AND_Truth_Table
&gt;      o---------o
&gt;      |Row      |
&gt;      o---------o
&gt;      |AND-Row-1|
&gt;      |AND-Row-2|
&gt;      |AND-Row-3|
&gt;      |AND-Row-4|
&gt;      o---------o
&gt; 
&gt;      AND_Argument1
&gt;      o-----------o----------------o
&gt;      |Row        |    Arg1-Value  |
&gt;      |AND-Row-1  |    True        |
&gt;      |AND-Row-2  |    True        |
&gt;      |AND-Row-3  |    False       |
&gt;      |AND-Row-4  |    False       |
&gt;      o-----------o----------------o
&gt; 
&gt;      AND_Argument2
&gt;      o-----------o----------------o
&gt;      |Row        |    Arg2-Value  |

&gt;      |AND-Row-3  |    True        |
&gt;      |AND-Row-4  |    False       |
&gt;      o-----------o----------------o
&gt; 
&gt;      AND_Result
&gt;      o-----------o----------------o
&gt;      |Row        |    Result-Value|
&gt;      |AND-Row-1  |    True        |
&gt;      |AND-Row-2  |    False       |
&gt;      |AND-Row-3  |    False       |
&gt;      |AND-Row-4  |    False       |
&gt;      o-----------o----------------o
&gt; 
&gt;      AND_Truth_Table_Query (Query Definition)
&gt; 
&gt;      SELECT AND_Argument1.[Arg1-Value],
&gt;             AND_Argument2.[Arg2-Value],
&gt;             AND_Result.[Result-Value]
&gt;      FROM
&gt;        (AND_Argument1
&gt;           INNER JOIN AND_Argument2
&gt;             ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Argument2.Row)
&gt;           INNER JOIN AND_Result
&gt;             ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Result.Row;
&gt;      
&gt;      (Result of executing the query)
&gt;      o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt;      |Arg1-Value | Arg2-Value | Result-Value|
&gt;      o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt;      |True       | True       | True        |
&gt;      |True       | False      | False       |
&gt;      |False      | True       | False       |
&gt;      |False      | False      | False       |
&gt;      o-----------o------------o-------------o
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  From where I sit doing this is trivial technically.
&gt;      And when I say that a triadic relation can be "reduced" to
&gt;      a dyadic form, this (and not something else) is what I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  The question is, why and when might this be useful?
&gt;      The answer is that many n-ary relations are overconstrained.
&gt;      I.e. they are not a good model because there are many cases
&gt;      they do not support.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  This is particularly so when activities are represented
&gt;      by relations.  Take giving as an example.  Using a relation
&gt;      to represent this does not only require that there is a giver,
&gt;      a receiver, and a gift, but it requires that there is not more
&gt;      than one giver, receiver, and gift.  Whilst it is true that
&gt;      there are some giving acts for which this constraint holds,
&gt;      it is not true for all giving activities.  And whilst you
&gt;      could define relations for all the possible combinations
&gt;      of different numbers of givers, receivers, and gifts,
&gt;      this is not particularly practical.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  So how does changing the representation of an activity
&gt;      from a relation to a set and some binary relations help?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  The answer is that it removes the constraints.
&gt;      Actually it removes both the minimum constraints
&gt;      and the maximum constraints.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Even removing the minimum constraint can be useful
&gt;      from an epistemological viewpoint.  So whilst in
&gt;      an act of giving ontologically we know that there
&gt;      must be at least one giver, one given and one gift,
&gt;      do we necessarily have knowledge of each of these
&gt;      for any giving activity?  More particularly do we
&gt;      always have to care?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Example:  Steve Redgrave was given his 5th gold medal in
&gt;      rowing at the Sydney Olympics.  Do we care who gave it to him?
&gt;      Would we wish to be prevented from recording anything about this
&gt;      giving act if we could not identify the person who gave 
&gt; it to him?
&gt;      I think not.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Of course there are times when you do want to require some 
&gt;      information.  Explicit axioms can be used to support this.
&gt;      For example, if you do not have a product ordered and
&gt;      a customer at least, then there is no purpose to
&gt;      accepting only partial information as an order.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  By Way Of "Expostulation", Jon Awbrey To Matthew West Wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  | My comment was directed to the question of what you 
&gt; "syntacticians"
&gt;      | intend by the various symbols that you introduce on 
&gt; the right side
&gt;      | of this purported definition, equivalence, or 
&gt; whatchamacallit this
&gt;      | very hour or minute.  You are a sensible person.  If 
&gt; you ask me to
&gt;      | define or to explain some problematic concept or term 
&gt; that I foist
&gt;      | on the discussion, and if my response is stated in 
&gt; terms of eleven
&gt;      | or twelve rather more problematic concepts or terms, 
&gt; then you will
&gt;      | immediately "smell a rat", as they say, and demand 
&gt; that I try once
&gt;      | again to reduce the total complicity of what I tender 
&gt; as definiens.
&gt;      | Thus, a person does not escape the charge of a 
&gt; circular definition
&gt;      | simply by placing primes on the recursèd subsequent 
&gt; appearances of
&gt;      | the symbol or term to be defined, by conferring a 
&gt; diversionary new
&gt;      | alias upon it, or by changing its name to protect his 
&gt; innocence of
&gt;      | knowledge about the subject.  No, sensible people are 
&gt; not deceived
&gt;      | by callous gambits and shallow tricks such as these, 
&gt; now are they?
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Virtual Reality (VR) is a lot of fun, can be very educational,
&gt;      and is well-known to have a panoply of practical applications,
&gt;      among which number a wealth of deadly serious industrial uses --
&gt;      I have seen instructional software for the domain of physics
&gt;      where one can play with frictionless pucks, bounce a six-ton
&gt;      superball off an ideally inelastic concrete wall on a planet
&gt;      with the gravity of Jupiter, all while keeping my own bipeds
&gt;      solidly planted on "Terra Firma" (TF), where I can entertain
&gt;      myself with life in a universe where entropy is conservative
&gt;      and energy is liberal, been there, done that, and I can tell
&gt;      you that it was a truly miraculous existence, a virtual trip,
&gt;      if not quite literally a Veri-Table Experience -- but a line
&gt;      divides a "Virtual Imaginary Experiential World" (VIEW) from
&gt;      a "Virtually InExistent World" (VIEW), a line evidently cast
&gt;      too finely in this thin air to be dreamt of in the images of
&gt;      my acronymic philosophy.  But if the lesson that a person is
&gt;      thereby instructed to draw from this bit of virtual exercise
&gt;      is that the laws of physics and the laws of information are
&gt;      somehow optional for the likes of me and thee, or that they
&gt;      could indeed be disrespected by the very designatories who
&gt;      designed these virtual environments, then that person has
&gt;      another lesson coming.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  But I am a sensible person, too -- no, really! -- at any rate,
&gt;      when the currents of my rarefied air have a functional moment
&gt;      of coordinate projection in exactly the right eigen-direction,
&gt;      and so I must tell you that I smell something just a bit ripe,
&gt;      indeed, more over-ripe, here, in this, your reputed reduction.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  So I will ask you to climb down off your end-user's high-chair,
&gt;      and to think for a while about what is really going on beneath
&gt;      the glib and glossy surface of your Microsoft XS, and then, if
&gt;      you honestly believe, and mean to claim, that no ANDimals were
&gt;      used in the making of this filmy production, well, then we may
&gt;      indeed be forced to proceed a bit further with the analysis of
&gt;      your analysis, and all the categoriness of this meta-reduction.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I see no "and"s, simply a number of tables with no more
&gt;      than 2 columns from which your world view can be derived
&gt;      through the application of a relational operation.
&gt; ----------------------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; Clearly some high-chairs are higher than others,
&gt; if you cannot see the AND's from where you sit.
&gt; But no matter, we will make our descent slowly.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, I am afraid that I cannot permit you
&gt; to let the "Invisible Hand Of Gates" (IHOG) --
&gt; I am speaking of "logical gates", of course --
&gt; do the homework for you, and so I will have
&gt; to repeat the question that I asked several
&gt; times already:  "What relational operation?"
&gt; And it must be you that defines it, in many
&gt; words or in few, in howsoever many it takes,
&gt; or else it will never come up to the bar of
&gt; being defined at all.  Others have met this
&gt; test with regard to what they mean by their
&gt; favorite forms of analysis &amp; synthesis, and
&gt; so there is no reason that you might expect
&gt; to escape it.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
MW: Now you are just being silly. It doesn't matter whose definition
it is or what language it is in as long as it works. Therefore
the SQL above is sufficient definition of the relational
operation I refer to i.e.

      SELECT AND_Argument1.[Arg1-Value],
             AND_Argument2.[Arg2-Value],
             AND_Result.[Result-Value]
      FROM
        (AND_Argument1
           INNER JOIN AND_Argument2
             ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Argument2.Row)
           INNER JOIN AND_Result
             ON AND_Argument1.Row = AND_Result.Row;

Loosely translated into English this says:

Join AND_Argument1, AND_Argument2 on the column row.
Join the result to AND_result on the column row.
From the result select the columns 
Arg1-Value, Arg2-Value, Result-Value.

In any case, this is only required to support your view, it
is not a part of the underlying information.
