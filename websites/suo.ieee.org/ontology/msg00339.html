I just returned from a one-week trip and found 130 new
messages, mostly from the SUO message mill.  I'll get around
to some of them in some random order, but first I wanted to
endorse Pat Hayes' point about the multitude of things that
must be accommodated by the SUO:

&gt;First, there are many abstracta (which have no 
&gt;spatiotemporal location) other than collections or ordered 
&gt;collections. In fact, just about any mathematical structure can be 
&gt;considered among these things, and there may be more kinds of 
&gt;mathematical structure than there are kinds of physical object...

&gt;Second, most people (though not all) would make a distinction between 
&gt;the things that occupy space and/or time, on the one hand, and the 
&gt;spaces and/or times that they occupy, on the other.

&gt;Third, there are 
&gt;things that can be located in spacetime without themselves occupying 
&gt;any of spacetime: moments, surfaces of various kinds, point motions, 
&gt;pathways, etc.. Geography alone supplies a rich vocabulary for 
&gt;talking about such things and the relationships between them.

&gt;Then 
&gt;again there are entire other categories of entities, whose locative 
&gt;nature is harder to classify but many people want to have as real, 
&gt;first-class entities: causes, results, manners (the 'way' something 
&gt;is done, eg happily or with a good style), and things indicated by 
&gt;words like 'nature' (small 'n', as in 'it is of the nature of fish to 
&gt;swim in water') , 'tendency', 'attraction'. Others make reference to 
&gt;'tropes' , in order to make sense of phrases like 'the greenness of 
&gt;the grass delighted me'; it is not enough, on this view to simply 
&gt;refer here to the fact that the grass is green: one has to be able to 
&gt;talk about the *way* that this is true.

&gt;"Promiscuous" ontologies, by the way, admit far more kinds.....

I would generalize Pat's point by saying that *every* term that appears
in an unabridged dictionary has been found to be useful by many people
over an extended period of time.  We do not have to define every last
one of them for the SUO, but we must provide pigeonholes for classifying
them and guidelines for the people who do the actual classification.

I also endorse Pat's response about 4-D and 3-D representations:

&gt;I think there are worlds you have missed here. For example, I dont 
&gt;understand the sense in which an emotion can be 4-D or 3-D. I wouldnt 
&gt;describe an emotion as an object at all (though it may be an entity.)
&gt;
&gt;I also don't think that it is right to say that a relation has 4-d 
&gt;attributes. One perceived advantage of the 4-d way of thinking is 
&gt;that relations have *no* spatiotemporal attributes.
&gt;
&gt;And finally, its not right to say that an attribute of something is 
&gt;3-d and therefore timeless. It is timeless because it makes to 
&gt;reference to time: it does not hold relative to a time, or at one 
&gt;time but not at another. But that doesnt make it 3-D. I dont know 
&gt;quite in what sense an attribute can be said to even have a dimension.

Again, I would generalize the point:  A 4-D coordinate system is fine
for classifying many things and events, but there are more things in
heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

John Sowa
