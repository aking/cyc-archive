&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Right.  My initial position would be that the ontology should take
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;an intentional view of terms, that disjointness should have a model
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;force of "necessary" (Bill Andersen pointed this out to me in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;private email) and therefore the axiom should be simple implication.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That decision would be a complete and total disaster. It would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immediately make the structural ontology unusable, if taken seriously.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It would be require that KIF be replaced by a modal language and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; render all the axioms first-order invalid.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Not that I think a lot hangs on this, but I don't get it.  To change the
&gt; &gt; &gt;disjointness axiom so it uses only a conditional would simply allow
&gt; &gt; &gt;models where classes could have no instances in common but still not be
&gt; &gt; &gt;disjoint.  At which point, exactly, does it start raining fire and
&gt; &gt; &gt;brimstone?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I ought to get more sleep before answering emails. The disaster (IMHO)
&gt; &gt; would not be to weaken the axiom, obviously, but to use anything that
&gt; &gt; is declared to have a modal meaning. If we start saying that axioms
&gt; &gt; mean what they do (eg that A=&gt;.B but not B=&gt;A) because the apparently
&gt; &gt; first-order assertions are really modal assertions in disguise, then
&gt; &gt; we are wandering into semantic fairyland, and the actual formal
&gt; &gt; language isnt in fact what we really mean when we write axioms in it.
&gt; &gt; No axiom anywhere is now safe, or sure to mean what it seems to mean:
&gt; &gt; there are modalities everywhere (or at least there might be: how the
&gt; &gt; hell could we tell, since they arent in the syntax?) Not fire and
&gt; &gt; brimstone, just fog.
&gt;
&gt;Well, I'm not sure this response helps to clear the air, Pat.  The fact
&gt;is that the modal character of a concept might be reflected in its
&gt;nonmodal axiomatization.  It doesn't follow from that that the
&gt;axiomatization is therefore "really a modal assertion in disguise", or
&gt;that it doesn't mean what it seems to mean; to the contrary, it means
&gt;exactly what it seems to mean.  There are no hidden modalities lurking
&gt;in the nearby bushes.

Actually I think there are. When axioms are justified by appeal to a 
meaning that is not reflected in the semantics, the Krep process is 
sliding downhill fast. But this is only a quibble; the meat is later.

&gt;Here's the kind of situation that it seems to me important to avoid.
&gt;Maybe it will illustrate some confusion on my part that needs clearing
&gt;up.  Suppose, in the usual extensional fashion, we define a relation R
&gt;to be symmetric if and only if, for all x and y, if Rxy then Ryx.
&gt;Suppose now we have an ontology of human relationships that includes the
&gt;loving relation, and that we are applying that ontology with respect to
&gt;a given domain of persons in which, as fortune would have it, all love
&gt;is requited.  By our axiom, we infer that loving is symmetric.

Big mistake. That would not be a valid inference from the axiom, 
unless you want to assume that the 'domain' to which you are applying 
the ontology is the entire universe by a closed-world assumption (in 
which case your later 'broadening' would be a contradiction, of 
course). If you want to apply universal axioms to non-universal 
'domains', then you need some way to indicate and describe those 
domains and restrict your quantifiers to them. 'forall' means exactly 
what it says: for ALL. It doesnt mean 'for all in some subdomain' or 
'for all we are considering today', or 'for all that have been 
invented yet'. If you want to say those things, then say them, but do 
it explicitly, don't warp the meaning of the logical quantifiers.

There are several ways to do this, as you know, including such 
exotica as context mechanisms and so on, but the simplest is probably 
to give the domain a name as a class D, and restrict your quantifer 
to that. Then the conclusion is that for all x and y in D, if Rxy 
then Ryx. That does not make R symmetric. You could of course invent 
a notion of symmetric-in-class, or some such, and conclude 
(symmetric-in-class R D), or you could think of D as a sort and write 
a sorted axiom in which the arguments of R were restricted, and so on.

Frankly, Chris, I am surprised to see someone with your logical savvy 
suggesting that the entire semantic basis of the language be warped 
to accomodate an obviously invalid inference.

&gt; Now
&gt;suppose our domain broadens to include Johann and Martha, and that
&gt;Johann loves Martha, but that his ardor is not reciprocated.  Is not our
&gt;ontology now inconsistent with this fact?

Yes, because you made an invalid inference, so no doubt it is now 
rife with inconsistencies.

&gt; How do you propose to avoid
&gt;situations like this?

See above. Let me ask in turn: from what application area do you get 
situations like this? I have never come across this idea of 
"applying an ontology with respect to a domain" before, where there 
kind of both is and isn't a closed world assumption (or maybe there 
is but then later it is taken away again, or something. However you 
cut it, something smells bad.) Maybe it only happens in Texas?

&gt;Seems to me (though I'm willing to be convinced
&gt;otherwise) the thing to do is to recognize that there's more to symmetry
&gt;(call it a modal element, or don't) than just satisfying -- as a matter
&gt;of current contingent fact

AArgh! I am not, and never have ever been since I started working in 
Krep about 30 years ago, talking about CURRENT facts. I am talking 
about FACTS. (If I want to talk about current facts, I will refer to 
the current situation, or the present time, and relativise my 
sentences to that.) You, with your mental shackles of 
ordinary-language philosophy, are the one who keeps importing the 
'current contingent' stuff into the discussion. Ask youself: why in 
God's name would we want a UNIVERSAL, UPPER LEVEL ontology that was 
talking about current, contingent, facts? Is all this effort going to 
produce something with a basic conceptual apparatus which is 
guaranteed to become out of date every time someone steps on a 
butterfly in New Orleans? Our ontologies aren't supposed to be 
sitting about chatting to one another about current gossip: they are 
supposed to be the general conceptual architecture of any reasoner, 
something that should be sufficient to last it forever and enable it 
to think about anything.
