&gt; 
&gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Please see responses below--
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Phil

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: If I compare EXIST and KIF I think they are functionally
&gt; &gt; fairly similar.
&gt; &gt; EXIST is designed with a processing model in mind, whereas 
&gt; KIF is designed
&gt; &gt; for exchange. I also think that EXIST is easier to read 
&gt; than KIF. This was
&gt; &gt; the main reason for rejecting KIF when we started to develop
&gt; &gt; EXIST. However,
&gt; &gt; I am aware that EXIST could be improved too from this point of view.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: I think that "understandability" should be a criterion in 
&gt; selecting a
&gt; language, though it is subjective...People tend to like what they've
&gt; developed or already learned...

MW: However, if we are to be successful inth elong run, we have to make what
we are doing accessible. Graham has talked much about using ACE, or a
restricted form of ACE as one notation for the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: This reminds me of the issue that is often discussed 
&gt; regarding the ease
&gt; of understandability and expressiveness of predicate calculus 
&gt; vs. natural
&gt; language -- In particular, John Sowa has written about this issue in
&gt; comparing predicate calculus vs. conceptual graphs... It 
&gt; seems possible that
&gt; the same kinds of arguments might translate to KIF (with the 
&gt; same kinds of
&gt; rebuttals)...(?) This may be a way to address the 
&gt; understandability and
&gt; expressiveness question...
&gt; 
MW: Well there is another issue here, and that is that CG's have a
linguistic bias, which presupposes something of the nature of the ontology
you are going to create. Of course EXIST does the same thing with a
different bias.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: So yes EXIST could make a good starting point for the 
&gt; SUO. However, I
&gt; &gt; find here an assumption that KIF is the starting point, and I have
&gt; &gt; considered it unwise for a newcomer like me to challenge this.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Hmmm....I think it is generally wise at the outset of a 
&gt; great endeavor
&gt; to question all assumptions...

MW: I think I have done (more than) my share of questioning here.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: This gets back to the issue, what are the requirements 
&gt; for the ontology,
&gt; and based on that, what are the requirements for the language 
&gt; in which the
&gt; ontology is expressed... Based on those requirements, which 
&gt; languages best
&gt; meet the requirements?
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: KIF is elegant, and a lot of thought and work has gone 
&gt; into it, clearly.
&gt; Yet it would not hurt to compare tools -- perhaps one or both 
&gt; tools may
&gt; benefit...
&gt; 
MW: Well I'm sure EXIST would benefit from some critical review.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I would like to make the suggestion that the SUO group
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should consider
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leveraging EPISTLE and other models already developed in
&gt; &gt; &gt; EXPRESS as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starting point for developing SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: This is a better idea. The EPISTLE Core Model is
&gt; &gt; &gt; designed to be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foundation that can integrate a range of ontologies (or data
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; models). It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not perfect, but it is the current result of some 15 years
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concerted effort
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by a range of people.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: I am glad to hear this. I hope that SUO'ers will give 
&gt; very serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; consideration to use of EPISTLE as a starting point.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I really think we would get there quicker if we did.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Well, this recommendation is now on the table, for the group to
&gt; consider.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EXPRESS, EPISTLE and the other models developed in
&gt; &gt; &gt; EXPRESS, have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of having been developed over several years by many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people in an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open, standards-based effort.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: One of the key things we can bring is experience of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developing standards
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in this area. The SUO does not have to suffer all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes that we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to make.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: I think this is a very important point. Any insights 
&gt; that you can
&gt; &gt; &gt; provide should be very helpful to the group.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Most of the objections I have been raising to our 
&gt; current course are
&gt; &gt; based on this experience. I know exactly where we are 
&gt; currently headed -
&gt; &gt; I've been there.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Can you summarize from your perspectives, what mistakes 
&gt; are currently
&gt; being made by SUO (or towards which SUO is headed) and what you would
&gt; recommend to address them?
&gt; 
MW: The main lesson is that there are no short cuts, only diversions and
dead ends.
