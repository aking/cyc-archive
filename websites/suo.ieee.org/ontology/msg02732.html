&gt;Nicola,
&gt;  A few replies on your points below:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;       In the meanwhile, our own contribution to the SUO initiative
&gt;&gt;will necessarily be very limited, mainly because of the fact that
&gt;&gt;this group hasn't been able to implement a strict issue-based
&gt;&gt;discussion methodology, nor the "bookshelf of results" proposed in
&gt;&gt;the past by Mike Uschold and myself. To me, the inhability of
&gt;&gt;achieving this and the lack of control of out-of-focus discussions on
&gt;&gt;the list reveals a serious failure of this initiative. This is also
&gt;&gt;the reason of my abstension regarding the Chair elections.
&gt;
&gt;I'm surprised by this comment.  One of the first things I did was to 
&gt;compile precisely such a bookshelf of results at 
&gt;<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/refs.html">http://suo.ieee.org/refs.html</A> .  For items that are relevant but are 
&gt;not themselves ontologies we created the page at 
&gt;<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/links.html">http://suo.ieee.org/links.html</A> .  To document further anything that 
&gt;folks feel is relevant, the page at 
&gt;<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/suopapers.htm">http://suo.ieee.org/suopapers.htm</A> was created and Jim made more than 
&gt;one invitation to people on the list to submit documents for posting 
&gt;at that location.

This is not what I ment, nor what Mike Uschold proposed in his old message:

&gt;I propose that a kind of SUO bookshelf be set up on our web pages. It would
&gt;contain detailed technical summaries similar to what Pat has produced. This
&gt;would be an
&gt;
&gt;     EFFECTIVE VEHICLE FOR DISSEMINATION OF THE 
&gt;     SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE ON MANY FRONTS,
&gt;
&gt;which to date is virtually inaccessible, buried in the discussion archives.
&gt;One can think of this as real-time knowledge mining of our archives.
&gt;This would affect many folk:
&gt;
&gt;1. The world at large can see our progress to date.
&gt;2. Newcomers can much more easily get up to speed.
&gt;3. Regulars can skip the details and be assured of a good summary, in time.
&gt;4. All participants can be more efficient in the time they spend reading SUO,
&gt;   being able to keep up to speed on things on their own time, without fear
&gt;   of missing key information.
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I have on many occasions been on the verge of getting 
&gt;off this list because it is overwhelming. Yet, there are MANY things 
&gt;that are of great
&gt;interest and relevance to me, which I lack the time to follow and 
&gt;contribute in detail to.  A kind of SUO bookshelf, I hope would make 
&gt;everyone make more
&gt;efficient use of their SUO-time.
&gt;
&gt;I propose the following process/format for how this might happen.
&gt;
&gt;1. Discussion threads take place in the usual fashion.
&gt;
&gt;2. When things settle down a bit, and points of agreement are reached, these
&gt;should be summarized and fed back to the group. This would also include points
&gt;where people agree to disagree.
&gt;
&gt;3. When the main participants in the discussion reach agreement on the
&gt;summary, then it could be submitted to the overall group for placement
&gt;on the 'bookshelf'.   The assumption is that things DO go on the bookshelf.
&gt;I don't think we want a formal voting process for this. The idea of going to
&gt;the group at large, is to see if there are any further suggestions or
&gt;improvements to the document.
&gt;
&gt;4. We announce the existence of each new entry to the bookshelf to a SUO
&gt;interest group which is only intersted in the outcomes and timely 
&gt;announements,
&gt;rather than the day to day discussions.  We may already have such list, I do
&gt;not know whether the creation of SUO sub-lists some months ago, actually
&gt;worked.

Douglas McDavid made some interesting proposals concerning ways to 
implement this issue-based system, but nothing happened. John Sowa 
proposed some (less fancy) tools, and nothing happened. John Awbrey 
is still flooding our mailbox, though...

Well, I agree that these criticisms are not very constructive, but I 
also have a
CONSTRUCTIVE PROPOSAL:

I talked today with Aldo Gangemi &lt;aldo@saussure.irmkant.rm.cnr.it&gt;, 
who volunteers on selecting the most relevant issues from our 
previous discussions, and maintaining an issue/sub-issue list along 
Mike's proposal. Format and tools can be discussed later (we can 
start with a manual list to be posted on the Web). The main aim is 
coming up to this issue list and checking agreements/disagreements on 
the various options that have been proposed in the past. This is a 
huge task, that would be simplified if everybody tries to help Aldo, 
maybe refraining from discussing other things for a while. I'll do my 
best to help Aldo, as we are working on a common project together 
anyway.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;       A further reason of disappointment is the way the IEEE SUO
&gt;&gt;workshop has been managed. Still I don't know how many papers have
&gt;&gt;been submitted and selected. I suspect that ours was the only paper.
&gt;&gt;This could have been a useful opportunity to force people to condense
&gt;&gt;their proposals in papers, but apparently it didn't work.
&gt;
&gt;This is the first I've heard of this concern from you.  I have not 
&gt;participated in any conference where the participants were routinely 
&gt;informed of all the acceptances prior to the conference so I don't 
&gt;think this is standard practice.  On the other hand, it's certainly 
&gt;a reasonable request once made.  Yours was certainly not the only 
&gt;paper.  I'll suggest to the other members of the organizing 
&gt;committee that we publish the papers on the web.  Chris Menzel has 
&gt;already made this suggestion.

I warmly suggested the same some time ago... More papers, less messages!
