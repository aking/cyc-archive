John,
   Comments below:

At 12:03 PM 6/3/2001 -0400, John F. Sowa wrote:

&gt;And by the way, my reasons for disliking the term "regular" for
&gt;formally defined concepts are related to my long-standing arguments
&gt;with Pat Hayes and Nicola Guarino about the differences between
&gt;natural languages and formal languages.
&gt;
&gt;Pat has continually argued that there is little, if anything,
&gt;to be learned from natural language semantics that can be usefully
&gt;applied to formal systems of knowledge representation, while I have
&gt;maintained that NL semantics and formal knowledge representations
&gt;must ultimately start with the same vaguely defined concepts.
&gt;
&gt;Pat has claimed that hierarchies of NL terms in WordNet, EDR, and
&gt;other terminological systems are irrelevant for kn. rep. and that
&gt;the work in "aligning" the WordNet concepts with the Cyc concepts
&gt;was a useless exercise that has no relevance to ontology.
&gt;
&gt;On the contrary, I have argued that there is a continuum between
&gt;the "formal ontologies" used in databases, knowledge bases, and
&gt;systems like Cyc and the "terminological ontologies" used in WordNet
&gt;and EDR.  For definitions of these terms, see the glossary
&gt;
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/gloss.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/gloss.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt;which is based on discussions that we had in the ANSI ontology
&gt;workshops during 1996 and 1997, with some more recent updates.
&gt;
&gt;In his review of my KR book, Nicola has argued that I don't
&gt;present sufficiently formal definitions of all the terms in the
&gt;sample ontology given in the book.  I do give some axioms for
&gt;the basic terms, but I don't believe that a complete, formal
&gt;axiomatization is possible or even desirable.  The primary
&gt;reasons are given in Chapter 6 on Knowledge Soup, which includes
&gt;many examples such as the ones listed below.
&gt;
&gt;These examples show that no single, uniform set of definitions
&gt;can be found for any of the most important concepts needed for
&gt;the ontology.  Even for mathematical concepts such as "set" and
&gt;"mereology", there are multiple axiomatizations, any of which
&gt;might be preferred for some applications.
&gt;
&gt;Some people have suggested that we just "pick" one of the more
&gt;popular axiomatizations as the basis for SUMO (the SUO Merged
&gt;Ontology).  But any choice we pick is going to be wrong for
&gt;many applications.

I think that's just too strong a rejoinder.  I would agree that any 
ontology that we decide on is going to have some tradeoffs that might make 
portions less that optimal for a particular application.  However, I'd 
suggest that all application specific ontologies will need to made 
extensions anyway and so should be able, through composition of upper level 
concepts, to create the concepts which are most natural for that application.

To say that a particular ontology is "wrong" I think requires a firmer 
definition of "wrong" and identification of a serious logical error, such 
as a contradiction which is derivable from the ontology.

A somewhat weaker criticism might be that a particular ontology is 
"inefficient" or "inelegant" which might correspond to an operational 
definition that some set of examples can be faithfully represented by less 
statements in ontology X than ontology Y.

Without definitions that can be turned into computable, quantitative 
metrics, we're left with arguments that approach "I like my ontology better 
than yours."


&gt;For those reasons, I believe that a terminological ontology,
&gt;somewhat at the level of WordNet or EDR is valuable as an index
&gt;to the terms that are needed.

Our charter is to create an ontology which, among other attributes, is 
suitable for logic inference.  A terminological ontology is too weak for 
that.  Of course, one might say that our charter is wrong, but that would 
be a different issue.

&gt;Instead of having a single collection
&gt;of axioms, I believe that the SUO or SUMO should contain a hierarchy
&gt;of selected theories, each of which is consistent internally but
&gt;possibly inconsistent with other theories in the same hierarchy.

I agree with that, with the caveat that I believe such inconsistencies can 
be minimized to the point where they will be rare.  This is something that 
must be shown empirically though.

&gt;WordNet, EDR, or similar terminological systems could be used
&gt;to index the theories and assist in finding one or more that
&gt;could be used in a particular application.
&gt;
&gt;This approach is an attempt to formalize Wittgenstein's theory
&gt;of language games:  each theory in the hierarchy corresponds to
&gt;a particular "game", which could be played with the words or terms
&gt;in WordNet.  Each theory (i.e., game) represents one specialized
&gt;interpretation of the naturally occurring words.  I discuss
&gt;the relationship of this approach to NL semantics in the paper
&gt;on concepts in the lexicon:
&gt;
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/lexicon.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/lexicon.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt;I plan to discuss these issues in more detail in my talk at the
&gt;ICCS'2001 conference at Stanford on Friday morning, Aug. 3.
&gt;
&gt;Following is a repeat of my examples from the previous note,
&gt;which illustrate my point that no single set of axioms can be
&gt;assumed, even for the terms from science, mathematics, and
&gt;computer technology.

Pat has made a similar point but hasn't actually shown any particular axiom 
or set of axioms which show that such a set of axioms can't be 
assumed.  It's fair to state a belief that doesn't have rigorous 
justification but I think on both sides of this opinion, it is just an 
opinion.  Ian and I are moving ahead with the belief that a single ontology 
is possible and we'll see if ultimately our view is borne out in practice.

I'd also quibble with the SQL analogy you make below.  Any standard is 
likely to have portions which aren't as complete or rigorous as they need 
to be.  It's quite likely that even when SUO is very mature, that there 
will be concepts that aren't as completely defined as they need to be, and 
reasonable people will disagree on their interpretation, use and 
elaboration.  That won't invalidate the standard, just point to an area 
where it needs further clean up.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; As more accurate terms for describing the two kinds of concepts,
&gt; &gt; I would suggest "natural" and "technical".  Wittgenstein's point
&gt; &gt; was that *every* naturally occurring concept is irregular in the
&gt; &gt; above sense, and that the only terms that are not irregular are
&gt; &gt; the ones that have been artificially defined for a particular
&gt; &gt; technical purpose.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Even in science (including mathematics and computer technology)
&gt; &gt; most terms are "natural" or "irregular" except when they are
&gt; &gt; formally defined for a specific purpose, whose scope lasts
&gt; &gt; only for the duration of a single book, article, manual,
&gt; &gt; or computer program.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As examples, consider the terms "space" and "time" in ordinary
&gt; &gt; language, Newtonian mechanics, Einstein's relativity, and more
&gt; &gt; recent theories of cosmology.  People who have taken a course in
&gt; &gt; physics often equate Newtonian "absolute time" with "common sense",
&gt; &gt; but Newton himself had to argue against the "relativistic time",
&gt; &gt; which he believed was "common among the vulgar".  But what Newton
&gt; &gt; considered "vulgar" is today considered "advanced physics", and
&gt; &gt; most of the people in the world (considering the so called third
&gt; &gt; world nations as the majority) have concepts of time that are
&gt; &gt; very different from the ones that are "common sense" for people
&gt; &gt; who have grown up with clocks and schedules.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In mathematics, consider the concept of "number", whose definition
&gt; &gt; has gone through many twists and turns in mathematics books over the
&gt; &gt; past 2500 years and took even more radical twists and turns during
&gt; &gt; the 20th century, especially in the latter half with all of the many
&gt; &gt; different definitions that have cropped up in computer systems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was recently looking at a book about SQL (the O'Reilly book
&gt; &gt; _SQL in a Nutshell_), which included a comparison of the definitions
&gt; &gt; of datatypes (including numbers) in the SQL92 standard, the SQL99
&gt; &gt; standard, and four different implementations of SQL, none of which
&gt; &gt; exactly conformed to the definitions in either of the two "standards".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If physicists can't agree on a single definition of "space" and
&gt; &gt; "time" and mathematicians can't agree on a single definition
&gt; &gt; of "number", it is very difficult to imagine any concepts that
&gt; &gt; might be called "regular".
