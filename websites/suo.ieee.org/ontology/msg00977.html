&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;I think the definitions that you give may need some more work:
&gt;
&gt;continuant - The formal definition is that all the parts of a continuant are
&gt;present at the same time that the continuant is; in other words, a
&gt;continuant cannot have 'parts' which are separated in time, such as the
&gt;first and second halves of a football game.
&gt;
&gt;occurrent - The formal definition is: anything that lasts for a time but is
&gt;not a continuant.
&gt;
&gt;This seems to make all instantaneous (or whatever the atomic temporal unit
&gt;is) entities continuants - or at least, if not, it is unclear what they are.
&gt;It seems to me that there are some instantaneous things - such as the end of
&gt;my life. This would seem to be an occurrent as (1) it happens and (2) it
&gt;seems a part of another occurrent - my life.

Yes, I agree that would be an occurrent, if we insist on playing this 
game. You at the end of your life, however, would (just) be a 
continuant, so I 'm really not quite sure what this end-of-life 
instantaneous occurrent actually *is*. It wouldn't be the same as the 
occurrent which might be called 'you dying', which would be more like 
something that could be captured by a movie of a short time-interval 
during which you passed away. (Very macabre examples you choose.) We 
often use phrases like 'the end of x's life' to refer to a time or 
something like a situation, further clouding the issue.

Let me suggest removing the words 'formal definition' from my text, 
as indeed they arent formal and they arent definitions. There aren't 
any formal definitions of these terms, strictly speaking, which is 
part of the problem. I learned the occurrent/continuant terminology 
from Peter Simons, and have tried to follow his usage. In his scheme, 
as I understand it, an instantaneous continuant would be impossible, 
or at any rate an anomaly (it would be an enduring-type thing that 
ceased to exist immediately after being created, for some wierd 
catastrophic reason. )

&gt;You also wrote:
&gt; &gt;parts at the same time?  If a set is an entity, do members of a set
&gt; &gt;count as its parts,
&gt;NO!  Wash your mouth out with soap!
&gt;
&gt;I'd be interested to know whether I also have to wash my mouth out if I
&gt;(like David Lewis) want to think of subsets as part of sets?

That is more acceptable in polite society; though still enough to 
cause raised eyebrows and, if repeated, is likely to lead to being 
dropped from invitation lists of the best soirees.

There is a pretty well-investigated subject area of formalisations of 
the notion of 'part', called mereology. It seems clear that the 
set/subset relation and the whole/part relation are intriguingly 
similar in some ways, but also pretty clearly not the same relation, 
no matter what David Lewis thinks. At any rate, one would need to 
make a very strong case to say they were. If you substitute a team 
member, the team has a *different* set of players, yes? If you want 
to say no, then how are you going to talk about what I would call the 
set of players in the team?

&gt;You also wrote:
&gt;Notice it only arises for entities that are located in space
&gt;and time: abstract things like sets and numbers are not classified in
&gt;either of these ways. (Note in particular that a set of physical
&gt;things is not itself physical.)
&gt;
&gt;Are you taking physical and abstract as two sides of the same distinction
&gt;here - or are there more types. It also seems to me that the complete
&gt;banning of spatio-temporal location for sets can be problematic if you want
&gt;to think of things such as groups (football teams, and so on) as sets. Some
&gt;people have suggested this - and ordinary language (for what it is worth) at
&gt;least supports the view that they have a location ("the English football
&gt;team was in Hungary last week"). So treating sets as abstract seems to me a
&gt;choice which blocks off the possibility of treating 'physical groups' as
&gt;sets.

Yes, and I would indeed block that one, and insist that any axiomatic 
ontology make a sharp distinction between a physical group or 
collection (such as a team, a shoal or a flock) and a set. If you do 
not do this, then for example set-membership will need to have a 
temporal parameter. Good luck with adapting ZF (or any other known 
set theory) to include temporal reasoning. (And what else is down 
that road? Situations? points of view?)

Ordinary language is a lousy guide to ontological coherence, as I've 
said before. If the idea of 'set' were clear in NL, then people like 
Russell and Whitehead would have had a much easier time.

&gt;In the spirit of starting middle out (with rich middle-level concepts) - it
&gt;may make sense to defer any decision of abstractness and sets until we have
&gt;some more material to work on.

Well, if there is one topic in the world that might be said to have 
been formalized to death, it is surely set theory. You think the jury 
is still out? (And you think we are going to do better than Russell, 
Zermelo, Quine, Von Neumann, etc. ?)
