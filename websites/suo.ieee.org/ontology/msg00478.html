I'm catching up on email after a week away.

1.  I  concur with the section on voting rights.

2.  I (still) vote yes on the acceptance of the merged ontology as a
working
document.    We need to start with something definite sometime if we are
ever
going to make progress.   This provides a good basis and focuses a number
of issues.

I think John Sowa's recommendation of an initial
comment period is a good one, and I support that in a general way.
However,
However, transforming the document
in response to a large number of  comments (as I would expect)
 will be no easy task.   Is there a plan---or can the
IIDEAS experience give us some suggestions?

Subject:  SUO: Establishing voting rights



SUO,

     Let me ask one more time if there are any objections to this clause
on establishing voting rights.

Subject:  SUO: Establishing voting rights


 SUO Participants:

     Now that our project has officially been chartered by IEEE (IEEE
P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology Working Group), we need to establish voting
rights.

     Default Policies &amp; Procedures (P&amp;Ps) are provided to us by the IEEE
Computer Society Standards Activity Board (see
<A  HREF="http://www.computer.org/standards/ORIENT/p&amp;ptoc.htm">http://www.computer.org/standards/ORIENT/p&amp;ptoc.htm</A>) but these do not
specify voting rights within a working group.  Rights in most standards
groups are based on attendance at meetings (usually 2 of 3 prior meetings),
but since this group is working via email reflectors, we'll need to
establish our own rules.

 I propose the following:

 SUO Voting Rights Clause:

 Voting rights shall be granted to any individual with a material interest
in the development of this standard who either was a participant of this
group during its formation (see para. d.)  or has been a participant for a
waiting period of 6-months.

     a. 'Voting Rights' refers to the list of who may vote on formal
ballots taken by the SUO WG. If an individual does not have voting rights,
he or she may still submit comments on a vote and participate in
discussions
to resolve those comments.
     b. 'Material Interest' is defined (still seeking a definition for
this)

     c. A 'participant' is any individual (IEEE membership NOT required
or expected) who submits an application
(<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/SUO-Participants-Jan2001.xls">http://suo.ieee.org/SUO-Participants-Jan2001.xls</A>) and participates in any
one of the following ways (subscribes to any SUO discussion list, posts
messages to lists, comments on documents, or any other actions the Chair
deems to be participation).

     d. Voting rights will be granted to all those who participated in
this WG prior to Jan 9, 2001 and who submit an application form within 30
days of announcement of approval of this clause.  New participants must
submit the application and then wait 6-months.

End of Clause.

     The 6-month waiting period is consistent with the typical ruled used
by groups that have physical meetings, which is to require attendance at a
certain number of prior meetings. This is needed to avoid an influx of
voters to sway a particular vote.

     Comments are requested on the above proposed clause.  Anyone else is
welcome to submit their own version or approach to this need.  Since we
haven't established voting rights, we can't very well take a formal vote on
this clause, so let's just work through any comments and see if we can
reach
consensus.

Jim Schoening
