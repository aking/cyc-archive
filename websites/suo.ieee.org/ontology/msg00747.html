&gt;Mike, et al.
&gt;
&gt;But there seem to be some options about what the individual sibling
&gt;relations are in the real world (is this possible if there is a real world?)
&gt;
&gt;As Fritz Lehmann has also noticed, there seem to be two camps using the same
&gt;word (tuples) to denote different things.
&gt;
&gt;The logical view is that they are tuples - as Pat Hayes wrote:
&gt;Close. The relation is a *set* of triples: all the triples that the
&gt;relation holds true of. So for example if A sent Bill to B , then the
&gt;triple &lt;A, Bill,B&gt; is one of the triples in the "billing by post"
&gt;relation-set. Of course there are probably others in the same set.
&gt;Every time someone gets billed, that defines another triple in the
&gt;relation-set. Think of this set of triples as God's database of all
&gt;the billings that ever happened or ever will happen. (It has to be
&gt;God's since it might well be infinite.) As far as logic is concerned,
&gt;this (potentially infinite) set of triples *is* the relation in
&gt;question.
&gt;
&gt;The relational database view is that they are a different kind of tuple -
&gt;where, somehow the tuple also carries content.

Wait a minute. You think that a triple of actual things (people and 
messages, say) doesnt carry content? How much more concrete could 
content get than actually being some pieces of the world? Its like 
pointing to the actual thing instead of describing it.

&gt;We can distinguish them by their identity conditions. If we swap the columns
&gt;in relational database we do not change the identity (or meaning) of the
&gt;tuple.

If you swap the entries in one tuple in a table (without swapping the 
columns) you do change the meaning, though; thats the comparison you 
should make. This comparison is a bait-and-switch, since when you 
swap those 'columns' you are also swapping the implicit labellings of 
the columns. You can do that to mathematical relations as well, if 
you allow them to include that much extra structure.

&gt;If we swap positions in a tuple e.g. &lt;A, Bill, B&gt; to &lt;B, A, Bill&gt; we
&gt;do. Similarly while in logic a tuple can belong to a number of relation
&gt;classes, it is not clear that this is so for the relational view.

So two things can only have one relation in a RDB ?

&gt;One advantage of the logic view is that relations can be treated like
&gt;properties - and there can be a simple taxonomy of relations. This is more
&gt;difficult to achieve under the relational view. However, the logic view does
&gt;lead to the seemingly odd conclusion that for every relation class and
&gt;particular relation there also exists its inverse.

No, it doesn't. This is a delicate point but an important one (since 
it will be central in SUO-KIF, which can quantify over relations). 
Saying what a relation is does not automatically say that all things 
like that must be relations.  If every set of tuples was a relation, 
then we would have a genuine higher-order logic; but we do not make 
this assumption (though it is, I concede, often made by 
mathematicians.) So it is quite possible for a relation to exist but 
its inverse not to, or at any rate not to be considered a relation in 
the universe of all relations.

&gt; &gt; 4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the real world
&gt;unless you are qualified to study advanced topics)
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;Whatever you call it, there is something in the real world which
&gt;entails two things being related to each other in a particular way.
&gt;Take for exampl, being ciblings.  I'm sorry, but I can see no way round
&gt;ciblinghood being in the real world.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; I absolutely agree
&gt;
&gt; You can choose to call it a
&gt;relation, or a relationship, or a frobnit, but it is a real world notion,
&gt;which from time to time one may wish to represent.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; I choose to use the word relationship to refer to the thing in the real
&gt;world, and reserve it for only that. Conversely I choose the word relation
&gt;to refer to the construct in my model which represents the things in the
&gt;real world.  I sometimes want to talk about the one and sometimes the other
&gt;and find it essential to have different words to refer to them.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; A complication is that the word relation, in the singular, is used by
&gt;Ted Codd (and I believe generally by mathematicians) to mean the set of
&gt;tuples, whereas the word relationship, in the singular, in natural English
&gt;can only mean either a single instance, or a type of, relationship.  Thus a
&gt;relation (singular) actually represents many relationships (instances).
