Matthew --
    Your point about the difficulty of creating different extensions
to a common basic ontology without generating some kind of conflict 
is well taken:

&gt; 
&gt; MW: You seem to be making an assumption of minimal overlap. 
&gt; My experience is this is generally not true. If we just 
&gt; look at these two cases some areas of
&gt; overlap are:
&gt; 
&gt;  - Measurement of e.g. temperature, pressure, flowrate
&gt;  - chemical processes themselves, they go on in the body as 
&gt; well as chemical
&gt; plant
&gt;  - chemicals - the body is a bag of chemicals
&gt;  - process plant - e.g. dialysis machines are process plants
&gt;  - drugs are chemical products
&gt; 
&gt; So the differing viewpoints on these (and probably other 
&gt; areas) would need to be integrated, rather than just added to 
&gt; each other.
[PC]:
    Yes, this will be especially true if detailed relations or axioms
are attached to newly-defined objects, so that there are multiple 
links to other objects, which will increase the chances of conflict.
There is a *possibility* of having different extensions of the SUO 
with no conflicts.  The more likely case is for two differently-
developed ontologies to have some conflicting definitions.  If the 
conflicting concepts have the same names, they can be easily recognized 
and some resolution may be possible.  If the same notion is defined
using different labels, that also can be recognized, if all
relations are the same.  When two application ontologies use different
labels *and* different logical terms to define the same notion, that 
will present a really tough case to recognize.  Using an SUO is
still light-years ahead of using no common defining vocabulary,
for recognizing similarities and conflicts.
    To minimize the chances of unnecessary conflicts of that kind I think we

do need to have a "Reference SUO extension" which contains all of the
*consistent*
concepts that contributors are willing to submit and are definable using the
concepts in the SUO.  The SUO itself, I hope, will have as much as 
possible of the basic logical and semantic elements as are necessary to 
define most or all of the specialized concepts that will be needed
for practical applications.  
   The SUO committee will probably have to make contentious choices
regarding the contents of both basic SUO and any extension.  At this
early point, I hope we can make some progress toward perhaps some 
significant fraction of an SUO, with an embryonic "Reference extension
containing enough defined concepts to make the SUO definitions
clear.
    But for the particular cases you cited above:
 (1)  I would expect basic units of measure to be part of the SUO itself.
Many object-specific or industry-specific attributes would be more
appropriate in an extension or a domain ontology.
 (2) chemical processes do indeed go on in the body as well as process
plants,
and everywhere else in the visible universe, except extreme environments 
like neutron stars.  I would expect a "chemical_process" to be part of the
SUO, and with a reasonable definition, I wouldn't expect any 
conflicts.  A "commercial_chemical_process" could be a subclass.
 (3) the body as a "bag of chemicals" (or more generally a structured
physical object as *solely* a "piece of some stuff") is unrealistic and
should not be allowed in the SUO.  Such objects have other essential
features.
 (4) I would expect a chemical "process plant" definition to exclude
small-scale reactors such as laboratory vessels and animal stomachs.
A "pilot_plant" would be an intermediate-scale case.  Definitions by size 
would be fuzzy, which is why I think that for artifacts, definitions by 
intended use, with subclasses having some physical constraints,  are 
most stable.
  (5)  Most drugs are indeed chemical products, having a specific intended
use;
but some are processed natural substances.  I think there is a useful 
distinction to be made between artifactual substances and those 
extracted from nature, and I hope that such a distinction can be encoded 
in the SUO.
------------
On time intervals:
[Pat Hayes (paper)}:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1.  A timeinterval is a connected piece of the time-plenum.
&gt; &gt; Things that have a temporal extent, or which occupy time in some
&gt; &gt; way, must have a time interval which is their life-span.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Just a check on what you mean here. An object may also 
&gt; have many time intervals of existance, not just one. Right?
&gt; 
    That section is a quote from Pat Hayes's paper, and my 
interpretation of that sentence is that there is some timepoint before 
which a temporally-located object did not exist (in the real world), 
and a time after which it no longer exists.  I am unfamiliar with 
the concept you refer to as having "many time intervals of existence"
(unless you are thinking of observations by different observers using
different clocks in a relativistic framework).  Is there a reference 
to a discussion of that manner of representation?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Pat C,
&gt; 
&gt; A few comments.
&gt; 
&gt; snip
&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt; 1. Clarification: "different" ontologies
&gt; &gt;    To clarify a point about the goal of interoperability: Pat's
&gt; &gt; earlier note asked how ontologies using an SUO can be
&gt; &gt; "different":
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; [Pat Cassidy]
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;    My understanding of the purpose (or one purpose) of the SUO
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; effort was to create a defining vocabulary of basic terms that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; will allow a user to define a concept in terms of the SUO and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thereby permit someone with a different ontology to use the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; same concept, with the same axioms and inferences, when two 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ontologies want to transfer information.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; [Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; &gt; Already this seems odd. If they are using the same axioms and
&gt; &gt; &gt; inferences, then in what sense are the ontologies different? An
&gt; &gt; &gt; ontology only is a set of axioms. The key point is that
&gt; &gt; &gt; different ontologies will not use the same axioms, not even 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same nonlogical vocabulary, and that the various vocabularies 
&gt; &gt; &gt; in use will be(and already are) profoundly irreconcilable with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; each other.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    Two ontologies can be "different" in the intended sense if
&gt; &gt; they both use the SUO, and differ by having different added
&gt; &gt; definitions, not necessarily covering the same area of knowledge.
&gt; &gt; One ontology for example may have added definitions and axioms
&gt; &gt; about health care, and another about some chemical manufacturing
&gt; &gt; process.  If these two ontologies are to be used to exchange
&gt; &gt; conceptual information in one of those two specialized areas, the
&gt; &gt; defining axioms need to be exchanged, and unless there is some
&gt; &gt; conflict in one or more of the added definitions, both
&gt; &gt; ontologies, *after* exchange of axioms, would in effect be the
&gt; &gt; same, and inferences that both systems make about the same topics
&gt; &gt; should be identical.  This should be true even if not all added
&gt; &gt; axioms in both ontologies were exchanged, but only those
&gt; &gt; affecting the areas in which information is to be exchanged -- in
&gt; &gt; this case the resulting ontologies will only be "the same" with
&gt; &gt; respect to the common set of concepts, and otherwise "different".
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You seem to be making an assumption of minimal overlap. 
&gt; My experience is
&gt; this is generally not true. If we just look at these two 
&gt; cases some areas of
&gt; overlap are:
&gt; 
&gt;  - Measurement of e.g. temperature, pressure, flowrate
&gt;  - chemical processes themselves, they go on in the body as 
&gt; well as chemical
&gt; plant
&gt;  - chemicals - the body is a bag of chemicals
&gt;  - process plant - e.g. dialysis machines are process plants
&gt;  - drugs are chemical products
&gt; 
&gt; So the differing viewpoints on these (and probably other 
&gt; areas) would need
&gt; to be integrated, rather than just added to each other.
&gt; snip
&gt; &gt;                 3. TEMPORAL THEORIES
&gt; &gt;                 ____________________
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The theories we consider differ in several respects, both in
&gt; &gt; their axiomatic style and in the intuitions they support.  Most
&gt; &gt; theories are consistent with the following ideas:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1.  A timeinterval is a connected piece of the time-plenum.
&gt; &gt; Things that have a temporal extent, or which occupy time in some
&gt; &gt; way, must have a time interval which is their life-span.
&gt; &gt; MW: Just a check on what you mean here. An object may also 
&gt; have many time
&gt; intervals of existance, not just one. Right?
