Elijah,

After a couple of days of random reflections
I am feeling much refreshed, but now I have
been brought up short on time remaining to
relax and rest and recreate while I can --
but there is one liitle thought that is
rattling and rolling around in my brain
that I reckon I might just have time to
toss out for us to start up with on the
morrow, so I will try to pitch that.

One of the things that I keep on dimly glimpsing or darkly spying
in Aristotle's 'Psychology' is a certain dialectic tension between
the "possession" and the "exercise" of knowledge, which strikes me
as the precursor of what we have lately come to call the distinction
between "competence" and "performance" -- but that distinction is often
liable to get itself fixed into a "dyadic", or as I think that it might
be better to say, a "dichotomous" opposition -- and there is this hint
of a "tertium quid" that infuses Aristotle's perspective, not in the
sense of anything that would violate classical logic, of course, but
in the sense of the triadic synthesis or the compound nature of the
animation that integrates form and matter into a "living entelechy".

There are passages here and there throughout Peirce's work where
he appears to be intrigued -- if not just a little bit mystified,
as we all are! -- by what in the heck Aristotle might be trying
to say by means of, in terms of this concept of entelechy, that
quick-sliver homuncular entity that appears almost as if trying
to peck its way out of the shell of "chicken or the egg" (COTE)
ways of thinking.

So what is the most fitting thing, in a word, to call that third something
that is called to fill out the spectrum through competence and performance?
Its name is legion, but I will suggest "articulation" as perhaps the fittest.

All I Have Time For Now,

More, Later,

Jon Awbrey

Aristotle wrote:

a.  The theories of the soul (psyche)
    handed down by our predecessors have
    been sufficiently discussed;  now let
    us start afresh, as it were, and try to
    determine (diorisai) what the soul is,
    and what definition (logos) of it will
    be most comprehensive (koinotatos).

b.  We describe one class of existing things as
    substance (ousia), and this we subdivide into
    three:  (1) matter (hyle), which in itself is
    not an individual thing, (2) shape (morphe) or
    form (eidos), in virtue of which individuality
    is directly attributed, and (3) the compound
    of the two.

c.  Matter is potentiality (dynamis), while form is
    realization or actuality (entelecheia), and the
    word actuality is used in two senses, illustrated
    by the possession of knowledge (episteme) and the
    exercise of it (theorein).

d.  Bodies (somata) seem to be pre-eminently
    substances, and most particularly those
    which are of natural origin (physica),
    for these are the sources (archai)
    from which the rest are derived.

e.  But of natural bodies some have life (zoe)
    and some have not;  by life we mean the
    capacity for self-sustenance, growth,
    and decay.

f.  Every natural body (soma physikon), then,
    which possesses life must be substance, and
    substance of the compound type (synthete).

g.  But since it is a body of a definite kind, viz.,
    having life, the body (soma) cannot be soul (psyche),
    for the body is not something predicated of a subject,
    but rather is itself to be regarded as a subject,
    i.e., as matter.

h.  So the soul must be substance in the sense of being
    the form of a natural body, which potentially has life.
    And substance in this sense is actuality.

i.  The soul, then, is the actuality of the kind of body we
    have described.  But actuality has two senses, analogous
    to the possession of knowledge and the exercise of it.

j.  Clearly (phaneron), actuality in our present sense
    is analogous to the possession of knowledge;  for both
    sleep (hypnos) and waking (egregorsis) depend upon the
    presence of the soul, and waking is analogous to the
    exercise of knowledge, sleep to its possession (echein)
    but not its exercise (energein).

k.  Now in one and the same person the
    possession of knowledge comes first.

l.  The soul may therefore be defined as the first actuality
    of a natural body potentially possessing life;  and such
    will be any body which possesses organs (organikon).

m.  The parts of plants are organs too, though very
    simple ones:  e.g., the leaf protects the pericarp,
    and the pericarp protects the seed;  the roots are
    analogous to the mouth, for both these absorb food.

n.  If then one is to find a definition which will apply
    to every soul, it will be "the first actuality of
    a natural body possessed of organs".

o.  So one need no more ask (zetein) whether body and
    soul are one than whether the wax (keros) and the
    impression (schema) it receives are one, or in
    general whether the matter of each thing is
    the same as that of which it is the matter;
    for admitting that the terms unity and being
    are used in many senses, the paramount (kyrios)
    sense is that of actuality.

p.  We have, then, given a general definition
    of what the soul is:  it is substance in
    the sense of formula (logos), i.e., the
    essence of such-and-such a body.

q.  Suppose that an implement (organon), e.g. an axe,
    were a natural body;  the substance of the axe
    would be that which makes it an axe, and this
    would be its soul;  suppose this removed, and
    it would no longer be an axe, except equivocally.
    As it is, it remains an axe, because it is not of
    this kind of body that the soul is the essence or
    formula, but only of a certain kind of natural body
    which has in itself a principle of movement and rest.

r.  We must, however, investigate our definition
    in relation to the parts of the body.

s.  If the eye were a living creature, its soul would be
    its vision;  for this is the substance in the sense
    of formula of the eye.  But the eye is the matter
    of vision, and if vision fails there is no eye,
    except in an equivocal sense, as for instance
    a stone or painted eye.

t.  Now we must apply what we have found true of the part
    to the whole living body.  For the same relation must
    hold good of the whole of sensation to the whole sentient
    body qua sentient as obtains between their respective parts.

u.  That which has the capacity to live is not the body
    which has lost its soul, but that which possesses
    its soul;  so seed and fruit are potentially bodies
    of this kind.

v.  The waking state is actuality in the same sense as the
    cutting of the axe or the seeing of the eye, while the
    soul is actuality in the same sense as the faculty of
    the eye for seeing, or of the implement for doing its
    work.

w.  The body is that which exists potentially;  but just as
    the pupil and the faculty of seeing make an eye, so in
    the other case the soul and body make a living creature.

x.  It is quite clear, then, that neither the soul nor
    certain parts of it, if it has parts, can be separated
    from the body;  for in some cases the actuality belongs
    to the parts themselves.  Not but what there is nothing
    to prevent some parts being separated, because they are
    not actualities of any body.

y.  It is also uncertain (adelon) whether the soul as an
    actuality bears the same relation to the body as the
    sailor (ploter) to the ship (ploion).

z.  This must suffice as an attempt to determine
    in rough outline the nature of the soul.

Here is a study aid to assist with the reading of
the text.  What I think is especially relevant to
our purposes -- aside from the content of these
fundamental categories or "basemental concepts"
that echo in the everyday constitutions of our
minds and still support, if a bit contingently,
the greater parts of our thinking even today --
is the method that Aristotle uses, working through
analogy and prototype, or the well-chosen example,
to articulate, build, construe, derive, and apply,
in a recursive process, his system of abstractions.

So consider the following "Alignments of Capacities"
as you read Aristotle's text:

---------------------------------------------------
       Matter       |            Form
---------------------------------------------------
    Potentiality    |          Actuality
    Receptivity     |  Possession  |   Exercise
       Life         |    Sleep     |    Waking
       Wax          |          Impression
       Axe          |    Edge      |   Cutting
       Eye          |   Vision     |    Seeing
       Body         |            Soul
---------------------------------------------------
       Ship?        |           Sailor?
---------------------------------------------------
