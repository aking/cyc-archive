Chris, David, Dieter, Matthew, ...

Let me offer what I think would be a more helpful heading
for this subject, one which includes the specification of
the domains of definition of a relation as a special case.
Under this "form of generalization" (FOG), one may regard
an arbitrary relation -- and if I deem to say "arbitrary",
you can bet that I mean it with that proverbial vengeance,
conceptively encircling in one swell foop many multitudes
of hosts of relations for which the quarter of a constant
or even a definite adicity (arete, valence) cannot exactly
be exacted or expected, but never mind all of that now --
like I was saying, one may regard one's so-called "source"
relation as being "related" -- for let us not prejudge the
end of the day's fray by speaking of its being "reduced" --
to another collection of one's so-called "target" relations.

In many situations, we may speak of this relation between
source and target relations as a relation of "projection",
but one will most likely be able to think of other brands
of relations between relations that are not apt to fall,
nor very aptly to be cast, under this "projective" pall.
But never mind all that now -- it is best to start with
the easy examples and the familiar facets of phenomena.

In this view, to speak of the "place-j domain" of a relation
is to speak of what remains to speak of in the relation when
we choose not to speak of what resides in the other places of
the relation.  That is to say, if one pictures a k-place relation
as a k-column relational data table -- "But is it a table already
filled or a table yet to be filled?" you cleverly ask, and I will
have to let my silence pass for the promise to think on an answer
anon -- then one may think of this table as being set, that is to
say, quite literally defined, by the specification of those very
k projections onto those very k target domains of which we desire
to speak.  And that is "sort of" how the "a la cartesian product"
is actually defined in Category Theory, as best I can remember on
the current occasion, or as best I can tell at the present moment.

In sum, a question about the place-j domain of a k-place relation
is a question about the place-j projection of that k-place relation
onto a monadic relation, in short, it's about a projection onto a set.

One step up from this question, one can ask about about the projections
of a source relation onto targets that are all of them dyadic relations.

And so it goes ...

By way of trying to establish parallels between different forms of language,
I will try to go through the rest of this exchange between Chris and Dieter,
and to say how I would try to describe, from the POV that is outlined above,
what it appears from this perspective is being talked about here.

&gt; Deiter,
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested in some of your comments re: relation.
&gt; They bring up a point that has been bothering me for
&gt; some time.  And maybe one on which the SUO needs to
&gt; make an informed choice?  Anyway I'd be interested
&gt; in your position.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that there are (at least) two views
&gt; regarding particular relations in use in computing
&gt; (Fritz Lehmann of Cyc has made a similar point).

"(at least) two views"

I am mostly concerned with relating
"relations given by extension" to
"relations given by intension" so
I am hoping at this point that the
two views that you mention will be
ones that I can successfully relate
to questions of their ex-/in-tensions.

&gt; One based in set theory may be called the 'bare relation' theory.
&gt; In this view there are tuples (bare relations) with effectively
&gt; no real content.

I would say that a relation is always something more than any of its tuples,
and even if the extension of the relation happens to be a singleton set, since,
even then, most will say that {&lt;x1, ..., xk&gt;} is something more than &lt;x1, ..., xk&gt;.

Peirce used the term "elementary relation" as the intensional correspondent of
the extensional tuple, but this is a fine point that one commonly glosses over.

When you said "real content", I was just guessing that
you meant something about a thing having intensional
attributes, features, or properties.  Is that close?

&gt; One based more on database theory (within computing) assumes that
&gt; particular relations have content -- that there is, for example,
&gt; a particular 'between relation' between a number of particular
&gt; things (I believe (some?) DLs also take this view -- could you
&gt; confirm this?  Maybe OIL also takes this view?).

Now I am guessing that my previous guess was wrong.
Here, you seem to be using "content" to describe
the extension of a relation.  Is that closer?

&gt; This seems to be what you are talking about when you wrote:
&gt; "Any particular relation is not itself a set of relations.
&gt; 'between' does not specify a set of between-ness relations,
&gt; it's just a particular relation."
&gt; 
&gt; Under a bare relation view there is,
&gt; of course, no such thing as a particular
&gt; (in its strong sense) between relation.

Now I am just totally lost ...

&gt; The advantage of the 'bare relation' view is that
&gt; it uses a single mechanism for 'inheritance' over
&gt; 'concepts' and 'relations' (as you have classified them).
&gt; The disadvantage of the 'content' view is that is substitutes
&gt; inference for inheritance -- x-father-y-son implies x-parent-y-child --
&gt; rather than (x, y) is a member of (father-son) and (parent-child)
&gt; and (father-son) is a sub-class of (parent-child).
&gt; 
&gt; This is of course only the begining of the story --
&gt; there is much more to consider when making the judgement.
&gt; However the choice has implications for the axioms you use
&gt; to manage relation 'inheritance'.

Any clarification that anybody can supply would be appreciated ...

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
