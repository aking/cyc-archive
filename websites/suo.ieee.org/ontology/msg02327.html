&gt;Pat (Cassidy),
&gt;  Thanks for the crucial observation that
&gt;
&gt;heap - 1 = heap
&gt;
&gt;is the weak link causing the apparent paradox.

That is not the 'weak link'. It is easy to derive an analogous 
contradiction without that 'weak link'. However, consider the idea 
that any change that is invisible cannot change the truthvalue of any 
'sensory' predicate applied to the thing changed. That seems 
reasonable, does it not? I bet that when the merged ontology contains 
a theory of sensations, this will be a theorem. Now, don't talk of 
heaps: just make the observation that if a  collection of grains is 
large enough, then a change of one grain is an invisible change to 
the collection. That is in fact true, and its denial would have some 
very odd consequences; indeed, arguably, part of the whole idea of 
granularity in the first place is so that changes at or below 
granularity should be invisible: that is what we have the mass-noun 
construction *for*, because we really can't tell the difference 
between mud and mud-minus-one-grain-of-mud.  But now you have the 
heap paradox back again.

&gt;It may well be that formal logic cannot capture every intuitive 
&gt;notion, or if it can, that it may be tedious to do so.  I believe we 
&gt;need to do what we can to avoid paradoxes but once that is done, it 
&gt;may be sufficient for some concepts just to identify their boundary 
&gt;conditions and not search for a false precision that changes the 
&gt;original intuitive notion.

I entirely agree. But you do realize that searching "for a false 
precision that changes the original concept" is one approach to 
SOLVING (or at least avoiding) the problem, and *not* doing that is 
what CREATES the problem, right? Your amicable tone here ("once that 
is done....may be sufficient..." ) suggests that you may have things 
backwards.

&gt;  Informally we may say
&gt;
&gt;- a group is composed of a finite number of components
&gt;- one element is not a group

That does nothing for the 'heap' paradox. In fact it creates an extra 
little riff on the same theme.

&gt;  also relevant is the notion that
&gt;
&gt;- a large group is some context dependent multiple of components

Adam, you are a practical knowledge engineer. You must know that 
there is no (zero, none, nada) currently available theory of 'context 
dependent' that can handle this. Until someone provides, or finds and 
refers to, at least a sketch of what 'context dependent' means and 
how to formalize it, this form of words is just dishonest. You might 
as well say that we are going to get this into our ontologies by 
using magic.

There is a basic problem with 'vague' concepts. It is a very old 
problem and it has been recognized by many people on many occassions, 
and it is central. We have various ways to handle it, most of them 
being a form of denial rather than a solution.

1. Refuse to admit that the concepts we want are really vague, and 
replace those that are by suitably sharpened ones.  This might be 
called the standard ontological strategy, and it is probably the most 
useful in practice.  It is the one I have adopted myself for many 
years. But it really is not compatible with the goal of having the 
ontology be relevant to NL, since virtually every concept in natural 
discourse is 'vague' in this sense.

2. Note (along with recent contributors to this thread) that context 
is central to NL and since we are going to have to deal with it 
eventually, we might as well toss this problem into the same "in" 
tray as the general NL comprehension problem, the general AI problem, 
and the general problem of improving the Human Condition, and so on, 
and solve it when we get around to those. This has the merit of 
acknowledging the problem as real, without having to actually do 
anything about it.

3. Note that context is central to NL and that since the SUO is 
supposed to be relvant to NL, that therefore all the hard problems 
are either done or bound to get done soon, so by pointing out that 
vague concepts are context dependent, we have pretty much solved the 
problem, at least on our credit cards. This might be said to have the 
advantage of optimism over insight.

4. Actually come up with a workable theory of context-dependence 
which can handle the problem. If anyone wants to try this, or has any 
useful ideas on how to get started, I would love to hear from them.

&gt;
&gt;We will need to modify the definition for Group in the merged 
&gt;ontology to include something like
&gt;
&gt;(=&gt;
&gt;  (instance-of ?X Group)
&gt;    (thereExistsAtLeast (?Y) 1
&gt;      (mereologicalMember ?Y ?X)))

First, I fail to see how this helps; second, it isn't logically 
well-formed; and third, it embodies a conceptual mistake, since there 
is no such things as a mereological *member*. (Did you mean 
mereological part? But then it is trivial , since everything is a 
mereological part of itself.)
