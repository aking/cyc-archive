Pat,

One important point to remember is that P. said that anything and
everything could be considered a sign, including neural excitations
in the brain.  What keeps that observation from being trivial is his
taxonomy of various kinds of signs.

Examples:

 1. Qualisign:  A simple sensory quality, such as red or hot.

 2. Sinsign:  An existing thing, which is a sign of itself, such
    as a dog, a tree, or a person named "George W. Bush".

 3. Legisign:  A convention or habit, such as a rubber cone on the
    street causes motorists to turn away.

 4. Icon:  An image that resembles the thing it is a sign of,
    such as a picture, drawing, etc.

 5. Index:  Something that indicates its referent by some causal
    connection, such as smoke means fire, a pointing weathervane
    indicates the direction of the wind.

 6. Symbol:  Something that indicates its referent by convention,
    such as a stop light or insignia on a uniform.

 7. Rheme:  A formal symbol that indicates a specific type of entity,
    such as the word "telephone", which indicates a telephone.

 8. Dicent Sign:  A formal symbol that states a proposition, such as
    a sentence in English or a formula in mathematics.

 9. Argument:  A sequence of dicent signs that expresses a lawlike
    relationship (such as a proof in logic).

Some comments:

| A sign is something,
| 'A', which brings something, 'B', its 'interpretant'
| sign, determined or created by it, into the same
| sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort)
| with something, 'C', its 'object', as that in
| which itself stands to 'C'.

A, B, and C are different kinds of signs. For example #1 above,
the sign A would be some retinal stimulation, B would be some
neural excitation, which may be called a "percept", and C would
be another neural excitation, which may be called a "concept".

For example #2, A might be my cat Yojo, B would be my concept of Yojo,
and C would be the name "Yojo".
 
For example #9, A would be the symbols in a logic book, B would be
some concept of the symbols, and C would be the interpretation as
a logical argument in whatever kind of "thinking" occurs when a
logician reads a proof.

&gt; 2. Leaving 1. aside for now, it has a second circularity, in that the
&gt; 'correspondence' that A brings about between B and C is the same as
&gt; that which holds between A and C. However since we are told nothing
&gt; about the relationship betwen either B and C or between A and C,
&gt; there seems to be no place to start in trying to apply this, er,
&gt; definition. It doesnt constrain the meaning of the terms it uses in
&gt; any way.

P. wrote many pages about the relationships, how one sign brings
about another, etc.  That definition is a summary of many, many
pages of explanation.

&gt; 3. The definition refers to A bringing about something. The only way
&gt; I can make sense of this would seem to involve A being an agent of
&gt; some kind, or at least something that can cause a process or event.

The agent is the entity (human, animal, robotic, or whatever) that
interprets A as a sign of C by means of some internal representation B.

&gt; To "bring about" anything at all, something would seem to need to
&gt; *happen*; some change must be taking place; something becoming true
&gt; that was formerly false.

That process of interpretation takes place inside of the "agent",
which in P's examples could be a bee or even a protozoan (they weren't
too clear about bacteria in those days, but he would have considered
them as suitable "agents" for at least the very simple kinds of signs
in examples #1 and maybe #2).  Perhaps bacteria could have "habits",
as in example #3, but those would probably be inherited rather than
learned -- an example of species-level learning rather than
individual learning.
