Doug, Bernard, Matt, ...

I agree that the representation of intentionality is a very relevant
problem, in at least two ways; our own intentionality(s) in constructing an
ontology, and the intentionality which may be possessed by the things we
represent within an ontology.

&gt; * a team of football players.

If the observer is concerned about whether the team wins or loses a game,
then the intentionality of the players is very important, along with their
roles on the team, etc. If the observer is concerned about booking an
airplane reservation for the team, then the intentionality of the players is
less important, we may only care about who is on the team, not who plays
what role on the team, etc.

&gt; * a flock of geese
&gt; * a swarm of bees
&gt; * a culture of slime mold cells (collecting to form a stalk)
&gt; * a crowd in a panic
&gt; * the growth of a willow tree

each of these may be viewed as a collection of agents, with more or less
intentionality, where the collection may act as an emergent whole.

&gt; * the architecture of a building - a structure largely created and
determined by our intentions and culture.

&gt; * a stellar constellation - a pattern of objects not created by us, which
is completely determined by our intentions and perceptions, and varies
according to our culture.

&gt; * a gameboard of Conway's 'Life'
&gt; * particles in a multi-body physics problem

Collections where the individual elements have no intentionality. In the
case of quantum particles, their behavior may be affected by how we choose
to observe them...

Doug, could you please repost the list of 100 distinctions among different
types of systems that you mentioned?

&gt;
&gt; I don't think you should conclude too much from the fact that the whole
&gt; group did not jump at the chance to comment on your question about
&gt; cross-cultural perceptions of time.  I think that some of your more
&gt; fundamental issues were a bit masked by being subordinated in a narrow
&gt; debate about how to represent the cutoff time for a parliamentary
&gt; procedure.
&gt;
&gt; Let me respond to one aspect of your concern, that of intentionality.  I
&gt; have mentioned several times on this list that intention should be
&gt; fundamental (part of the kernel, as we are now starting to speak).  I have
&gt; tried to make the case that the ontology we are working on should be the
&gt; framework for myriad domain-specific ontologies, and that what separates
&gt; one domain from another is largely a matter of intent.
&gt;
&gt; I also appreciate your reference to Prigogine.  I have tried on
&gt; occasion to
&gt; introduce the concept of system to this list, which I think is a concept
&gt; which, if not in the kernel, is at least very central.  At one point I
&gt; introduced a list of, I think about 100 distinctions among different types
&gt; of systems, extracted from an encyclopedia of systems studies.  This
&gt; particular note was passed over entirely without comment by the group.
&gt;
&gt; I have almost stopped writing this kind of note, because the standard
&gt; response is that I should write a rigorous axiomatization and submit it to
&gt; the (now so-called) SUMO.  My situation barely affords the time to read
&gt; this list, and no time for such detailed work.  I agree with John Sowa, as
&gt; well, on the point that some discussions and agreement on the basic shape
&gt; is in order before running off in all directions with apparently rigorous
&gt; elaboration.
&gt;
&gt; The bottom line for this note:  I think that differentiation of various
&gt; types of intentionality is an important piece of work, which, in
&gt; turn, will
&gt; provide important differentiation for various types of systems, as well as
&gt; for various ontological domains.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Matt
&gt;
&gt; I don't feel your remarks and questions as off-topic. To know if
&gt; intention,
&gt; awareness, purpose versus random, instinct, physical process should be a
&gt; major ontological distinction is not IMO a minor question. And it
&gt; is really
&gt; a good example of where the cultural context does weigh on the ontology,
&gt; and
&gt; even if the global feedback (or absence of feedback) I got on
&gt; this question
&gt; lately seems to indicate that most people on this forum consider such
&gt; questions as being out of scope, I'll stick to the viewpoint that they are
&gt; not.
&gt;
&gt; If you have an animist-pantheist view of the world, the intentionality is
&gt; as
&gt; present in the willow growth or constellations patterns than in the
&gt; building
&gt; of a temple. If you have a positivist-reductionist view of the
&gt; world, there
&gt; is no more intentionality in any of those than in any other, because the
&gt; notion of intentionality is considered as irrelevant altogether.
&gt; Between those two extremes is a middle path that most people today I think
&gt; implicitly agree to walk on, where the frontier between "random physical
&gt; process" and "intentional process" is a very fuzzy one, depending on one's
&gt; undecidable arguments about what one considers to be intentional.
&gt; Controverses on universe and life evolution, anthropic principle (weak or
&gt; strong), Gaia, Global Brain and others of the same kind show that even
&gt; physical processes in the early hot universe may be considered by some
&gt; people as "early intentions".
&gt; One interesting cutting approach is to be found in Thermodynamics
&gt; (works of
&gt; Prigogine and others), a cutoff being possible between near-equilibrium
&gt; processes well described by statistical laws (first and second
&gt; thermodynamic
&gt; principles: a crowd in panic maybe in this case if people are
&gt; considered as
&gt; particles with random moves commanded by pression, temperature
&gt; and volume),
&gt; and far-for-equilibrium complex processes like air transport regulation,
&gt; football games, bird migrations and forest growth. Such a cutoff is maybe
&gt; the less culturally biased possible among the presently available
&gt; distinctions, in the sense that it can be grounded on somehow measurable
&gt; characteristics, not on undecidable judgments.
&gt;
&gt; But the name we will give those categories will be loaded anyway. Not
&gt; mentioning purpose anywhere in the classification of processes - sticking
&gt; to
&gt; thermodynamics categories - would make this classification irrelevant
&gt; wherever the users will want to declare intentionality (because in their
&gt; view of the world, there is intentionality), and moreover would implicitly
&gt; declare that intentionality in itself is a somehow irrelevant concept. So
&gt; maybe we have to keep intentionality as a (possible) attribute of process,
&gt; but abstain to declare which classes of process - if any - have this
&gt; property, letting it open to every user.
&gt;
&gt; This is IMO just one aspect of the problem of cultural context. We have
&gt; many
&gt; undecidable propositions of that kind at the upper level. I would tend to
&gt; consider that undecidability is even a *characteristic* of the
&gt; upper level.
&gt; Otherwise, the work we are on would have been achieved centuries ago.
&gt; Culture is built on what a community agrees on about the major
&gt; undecidable.
&gt; So either we try to be the less culturally biased and build a deliberately
&gt; ambiguous and fuzzy ontology, leaving open and available every
&gt; choice about
&gt; undecidable propositions, and letting every user choose whatever
&gt; fits one's
&gt; community view of the world, either we build a "unique thought" efficient
&gt; fit-all consensual ontology, cutting of the undecidable in an axiomatic
&gt; (dogma
&gt; tic?) way.
&gt;
&gt; My hunch is that the market would be happy with the latter, and the
&gt; civilization with the former ... but I digress :o)
