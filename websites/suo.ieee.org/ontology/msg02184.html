&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I always take people at their word,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I take you really to want to know:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The POV that you have been exposing here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information contained in their apt expressions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The "Pat Hayes Universal Change Of Variables Formula" (PHUCOVF)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that nobody ever meant to say what some people once pretended
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it said, as have you also in regard to a co-indited point.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      Pat's proof, but I am not sufficiently versed in these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      things to be sure that you are not employing the same kinds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      of tricks that you claim Pat has employed.  So I'm afraid that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      is not an arguement that will convince me on its own.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      wish to do that you will have to present a specific example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      of where the information in some triadic relation cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      be transformed into some set of binary relations.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      provide the triadic relation, I will provide the binary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      relations from which the triadic relation can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      constructed (or not and admit you are right).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are all learning as we go, some of us one set of
&gt; &gt; &gt; things, others another, but I think that Pat and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have finally settled down to the purely logical --
&gt; &gt; &gt; in contradistinction to the "puerly rhetorical" (sic) --
&gt; &gt; &gt; facet of the task, and I am secure in the knowledge
&gt; &gt; &gt; that both of us are dogged enough not to let it go
&gt; &gt; &gt; until we flesh out some general satisfaction on
&gt; &gt; &gt; this particular bone of contention.  'On jugera',
&gt; &gt; &gt; as Evariste Galois said.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
&gt; &gt; &gt; any rational sense will come of arguing about any puported form of
&gt; &gt; &gt; "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
&gt; &gt; &gt; "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
&gt; &gt; &gt; unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
&gt; &gt; &gt; since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
&gt; &gt; &gt; at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
&gt; &gt; &gt; has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
&gt; &gt;      In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
&gt; &gt;      number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
&gt; &gt;      network of relations there is a path that links them together.
&gt; 
&gt; This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
&gt; that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
&gt; this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
&gt; such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
&gt; It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
&gt; 3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
&gt; same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
&gt; the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
&gt; are many such special cases of relations, but their existence
&gt; does not affect the general truth that many 3-adic relations
&gt; are not of this kind.  And, once again, the logical forms of
&gt; these very reductions involve 3-adic relations at every step
&gt; of the corresponding analyses.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, contemplate the 3-adic relation that is expressed by
&gt; the rheme "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- and then ---",
&gt; of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt;, and which
&gt; one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; |                        Jack
&gt; |                       o
&gt; |                      /
&gt; |   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
&gt; |                      \
&gt; |                       o
&gt; |                        Jill
&gt; 
&gt; Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
&gt; of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
&gt; where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.
&gt; 
&gt; The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
&gt; of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
&gt; is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
&gt; of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
&gt; suggest by means of the following scheme:
&gt; 
&gt; |                        Jack
&gt; |                [LP1]--o
&gt; |                 /      \
&gt; |   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12]
&gt; |                 \      /
&gt; |                [LP2]--o
&gt; |                        Jill
&gt; 
&gt; In this picture, the 2-adic relations LP1, LP2, and L12
&gt; are defined to capture forms of pairwise relations like:
&gt; 
&gt; LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
&gt;                  in the ordered pair q.
&gt; 
&gt; LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2nd component
&gt;                  in the ordered pair q.
&gt; 
&gt; L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
&gt;                  y is the 2nd component
&gt;                  in some ordered pair.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
&gt; defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
&gt; it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:
&gt; 
&gt; LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP2 (q, y).
&gt; 
&gt; This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
&gt; that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
&gt; all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
&gt; if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
&gt; There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
&gt; 2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
&gt; composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
&gt; have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.
&gt; 
&gt; And yet, once again, this entire skirmish to mop-up the residual bits
&gt; of 2-adic structure that may be squeegeed out of the original 3-adic
&gt; relation is being waged only after the general issue has been conceded,
&gt; for we had to use the 3-adic relation associated with the truth-functional
&gt; connective "and" just to express the definition of LP12.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L^0 and L^1
&gt; is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
&gt; At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
&gt; and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
&gt; along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now the "semantics" of the linking relations should support
&gt; &gt; the derivation of something more complex, but that is all.
&gt; 
&gt; It should support the formal recognition of "something more complex",
&gt; namely, a 3-adic relation which is not reducible to 2-adic relations.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
&gt; &gt;      for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
&gt; &gt;      that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
&gt; &gt;      then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
&gt; &gt;      statement about how I see relations.
&gt; 
&gt; This is another one of those places where I fear that we might
&gt; be using the word "relation" in some radically divergent way,
&gt; since I would not naturally speak of a relation in general as
&gt; representing anything, since relations are primarily objects
&gt; of discussion and thought to me, and not syntactic entities.
&gt; The special brand of a relation that I call a "sign relation"
&gt; does indeed have two of its three feet in realms of signs,
&gt; and there are many types of relations that I would choose
&gt; for "modeling" objects and processes in the world, and
&gt; there are very special sorts of relational structures
&gt; in mathematics that are called "group representations",
&gt; so maybe there is a bridge ahead, but I cannot be sure.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
&gt; &gt;      They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
&gt; &gt;      infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
&gt; &gt;      combinations of things, and then I see a further
&gt; &gt;      infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
&gt; &gt;      ourselves to those where all the members of the
&gt; &gt;      set have the same adacity).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of them,
&gt; &gt;      but to a very small subset we choose (note the word choose)
&gt; &gt;      to map our experiences of the world to in terms of connections
&gt; &gt;      (broad sense) that we see between things.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the world
&gt; &gt;      and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how to do it).
&gt; &gt;      I'm not sure you share that view.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I would suggest that we talked more about what was being represented
&gt; &gt;     rather than how it was being represented.  I suspect that we would
&gt; &gt;     then find more to agree about.
&gt; 
&gt; I am afraid that we can only talk about things in so far as we represent them.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As an object example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; taken for the moment in the converse direction of synthesis, joining
&gt; &gt; &gt; an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already an element of a 3-adic
&gt; &gt; &gt; relation, just as every other "binary operation" is a 3-adic relation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.  Binary operations
&gt; &gt;      are of the form F : a -&gt; b, and even though a and b might be quite
&gt; &gt;      complex, the essential form is binary.
&gt; 
&gt; I would say that the accidental form, even the superficial form is binary --
&gt; anything at all can be glossed over with a superficially simple appearance --
&gt; it is our job precisely to detect and to reveal the underlying complexities.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, there are good reasons for proceeding further, that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; once the omnipresence of 3-adic relations in every analytic
&gt; &gt; &gt; project is conceded, but perhaps it would be best for me to
&gt; &gt; &gt; halt at this point and see if we have any form of agreement
&gt; &gt; &gt; about this much, at least.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
&gt; &gt;      We are talking about representation of things, rather
&gt; &gt;      than what things are.
&gt; 
&gt; The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated knowledge of being,
&gt; is not a day that I think any of our sort will see this side of heaven.
&gt; The only way that we "fallible and mortal finite information creatures"
&gt; have to approach the One and the Universal is via the Many Appearances,
&gt; by taking up as many different styles and types of representations as
&gt; we can fathom, and then, by way of transformations on them, to distill
&gt; what invariants, half concealing and half disclosing, they may manifest.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If we set the representation by relations of particular adacity
&gt; &gt; aside, I think we would find much more to agree about.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that is a heavenly notion.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; circumstance that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from an element of one.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      of what a relation is to me.  This would easily explain how we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      have been missing each other.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will take up the task of that refinement at my next opportunity.
