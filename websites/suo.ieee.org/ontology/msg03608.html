1.3.4.7  Iconic Signs

In the pragmatic theory of signs, an &quot;icon&quot; is a sign that accomplishes
its representation, including the projects of denotation and connotation,
by virtue of properties that it shares with its object.  In the case of
relational tabels and graphs, interpreted as iconic representations or
analogous expressions of logical and mathematical objects, the pivotal
properties are formal and abstract in their character.  Since a uniform
translation through any dimension -- of sight, of sound, or imagination --
does not affect the structural properties of a configuration of signs in
relation to one another, this may help to explain how tables and graphs,
in spite of their semantic shiftiness, can succeed in representing the
forms of sign relations without essential loss or radical distortion.

Taking this unsuspecting introduction of iconic signs as a serendipitous
lesson, an important principle can be lifted from their style of success.
They bring the search for models of intellectual processes to look for
classes of representation that do not lean too heavily on local idioms
for devising labels but rather suspend their abstract formal structures
in qualities of media that can best be preserved through a wide variety
of global transformations.  In time these ventures will lead this project
to contemplate various forms of graphical abstraction as supplying what are
possibly the most solid sites for pouring the foundations of formal expression.

What does appear in one of these sign relational Tables?  It is clearly
not the objects that appear under the &quot;Object&quot; heading, but only the
signs of these objects.  It is not even the signs and interpretants
themselves that appear under the &quot;Sign&quot; and &quot;Interpretant&quot; headings,
but only the remoter signs of them that are formed by quotation or
by other devices that effect a similar function.  The unformalized
sign relation in which these signs of objects, signs of signs, and
signs of interpretants have their role as such is not the one Tabled,
but another one that operates behind the scenes to bring its image and
its intent to the reader.

To understand what the Table is meant to convey the reader is called to
participate in the informal and more accessory sign relation in order to
follow its indications to the intended and more accessible sign relation.
As logical or mathematical objects, the sign relations A and B do not exist
in the literal medium of their Tables but are only represented there by dint
of the formal configurational properties that they share with these Tables.
As fictional characters, the interpretive agents A and B do not exist in
a uniquely literal sense but serve as typical literary figures to convey
the intended formal account, standing in for concrete experience with
language the likes of which is familiar to writer and reader alike.

The successful formalization of a focal sign relation cannot get by
its reliance on prior forms of understanding, like the raw ability to
follow indications whose components of competence are embodied in the
vaster and largely unarticulated context of a peripheral sign relation.
But the extent to which the analysis of a formal sign relation depends
on a particular context or a particular interpreter is the severity to
which an opportunity for understanding is undermined by prior petitions
of the very principles to be explained.  Consequently, there is little
satisfaction in special pleadings or ad hoc accounts of interpretive
practice that cannot be transported across a multitude of contexts,
media, and interpreters.

What does all of this mean, in concrete form, for the proper appreciation of
the present example?  And looking beyond that, what does it mean in terms of
concrete activities that need to be tackled by this work?

One task is to eliminate several types of formal confound that currently
affect this investigation.  Even though there is an essential tension to
be maintained down the lines between casual and formal discussion, the
traffic across this range of realms needs to be monitored carefully.
There are identifiable sources of confusion that devolve from the
context of informal discussion and invade the arena of formal
study, subverting its necessary powers of reflection and
undermining its overall effectiveness.

One serious form of contamination can be traced to the accidental circumstance
that A and B and I all use the same proper names for A and B.  This renders it
is impossible to tell, purely from the tokens that are being tendered, whether
it is a casual or a formal transaction that constitutes the issue of the moment.
And it means that a formalization of the writer's and the reader's accessory
sign relations would have several portions that look identical to pieces of
the very sign relational Tables that are being placed under formal review.
