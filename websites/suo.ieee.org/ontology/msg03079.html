| But does it not seem more proper to call this the feeling's 'quality' than its content?
| Does not the word &quot;content&quot; suggest that the feeling has already dirempted itself
| as an act from its content as an object?  And would it be quite safe to assume
| so promptly that the quality 'q' of a feeling is one and the same thing
| with a feeling of the quality 'q'?

| 2.2.  Submanifolds, Immersions, Submersions
|
| Let X be a topological space, and Y a subset of X.
| We say that Y is &quot;locally closed&quot; in X if every point
| y in Y has an open neighborhood U in X such that Y |^| U
| is closed in U.  One verifies easily that a locally closed
| subset is the intersection of an open set and a closed set.
| For instance, any open subset of X is locally closed, and
| any open interval is locally closed in the plane.
|
| Let X be a manifold (of class C^p with p &gt;= 0).  Let Y be a subset of X
| and assume that for each point y in Y there exists a chart (V, r) at y
| such that r gives an isomorphism of V with a product V_1 x V_2 where
| V_1 is open in some space E_1 and V_2 is open in some space E_2,
| and such that
|
| r(Y |^| V) = V_1 x a_2
|
| for some point a_2 in V_2 (which we could take to be 0).  Then it is clear
| that Y is locally closed in X.  Furthermore, the map r induces a bijection
|
| r_1 : Y |^| V -&gt; V_1.
|
| The collection of pairs (Y |^| V, r_1) obtained in the above manner constitues
| an atlas for Y, of class C^p.  The verification of this assertion, whose formal
| details we leave to the reader, depends on the following obvious fact.
|
| Lemma 2.1.  Let U_1, U_2, V_1, V_2 be open subsets of Banach spaces,
|
|             and g : U_1 x U_2 -&gt; V_1 x V_2 a C^p-morphism.
|
|             Let a_2 be in U_2 and b_2 be in V_2
|
|             and assume that g maps U_1 x a_2 into V_1 x b_2.
|
|             Then the induced map
|
|             g_1 : U_1 -&gt; V_1
|
|             is also a morphism.
|
| Indeed, it is obtained as a composite map
|
| U  -&gt;  U_1 x U_2  -&gt;  V_1 x V_2  -&gt;  V_1,
|
| the first map being an inclusion and the third a projection.
|
| We have therefore defined a C^p-structure on Y which will be called
| a &quot;submanifold&quot; of X.  This structure satisfies a universal mapping
| property, which characterizes it, namely:
|
| | Given any map f : Z -&gt; X from a manifold Z into X such that f(Z) is contained in Y.
| | Let f_Y : Z -&gt; Y be the induced map.  Then f is a morphism if and only if f_Y is
| | a morphism.
|
| The proof of this assertion depends on Lemma 2.1, and is trivial.
|
| Finally, we note that the inclusion of Y into X is a morphism.
| 
| If Y is also a closed subspace of X, then
| we say that it is a &quot;closed submanifold&quot;.

| 2.  Manifolds
|
| 2.1.  Atlases, Charts, Morphisms
|
| Let X be a set.  An &quot;atlas of class C^p (p &gt;= 0)&quot; on X is a collection
| of pairs (U_i, q_i) (i ranging in some indexing set), satisfying the
| following conditions:
| 
| AT 1.  Each U_i is a subset of X and the U_i cover X.
| 
| AT 2.  Each q_i is a bijection of U_i onto an open subset q_i U_i
|        of some Banach space E_i and for any i, j, [it holds that]
|        q_i (U_i |^| U_j) is open in E_i.
|
| AT 3.  The map
|
|        q_j o q_i^-1  :  q_i (U_i |^| U_j)  --&gt;  q_j (U_i |^| U_j)
|
|        is a C^p-isomorphism for each pair of indices i, j.
|
| Lang, DARM, page 20.
|
| Each pair (U_i, q_i) will be called a &quot;chart&quot; of the atlas.
| If a point x of X lies in U_i, then we say that (U_i, q_i)
| is a &quot;chart at&quot; x.
|
| Suppose that we are given an open subset U of X and a topological isomorphism
| q : U -&gt; U' onto an open subset of some Banach space E.  We shall say that
| (U, q) is &quot;compatible&quot; with the atlas {(U_i, q_i)} if each map q_i q^-1
| (defined on a suitable intersection as in AT 3) is a C^p-isomorphism.
|
| Two atlases are said to be &quot;compatible&quot; if each chart of one is compatible with
| the other atlas.  One verifies immediately that the relation of compatibility
| between atlases is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence class of atlases
| of class C^p on X is said to define a structure of &quot;C^p-manifold&quot; on X.
|
| If all the vector spaces E_i in some atlas are toplinearly isomorphic, then we can always
| find an equivalent atlas for which they are all equal, say to the vector space E.  We then
| say that X is an &quot;E-manifold&quot; or that X is &quot;modeled&quot; on E.
|
| If E = R^n for some fixed n, then we say that the manifold is &quot;n-dimensional&quot;.
| In this case, a chart
|
| q : U -&gt; R^n
|
| is given by n coordinate functions q_1, ..., q_n.  If 'P' denotes a point of U,
| these functions are often written
|
| x_1(P), ..., x_n(P),
|
| or simply x_1, ..., x_n.  They are called &quot;local coordinates&quot; on the manifold.
|
| If the integer p (which may also be infinity) is fixed throughout a discussion,
| we also say that X is a manifold.
|
| Lang, DARM, page 21.
|
| Let X be manifold, and U an open subset of X.  Then it is possible,
| in the obvious way, to induce a manifold structure on U, by taking
| as charts the intersections
|
| (U_i |^| U, q_i | (U_i |^| U)).
|
| [Notation.  &quot;f | S&quot; indicates the function f as restricted to the set S.]
|
| If X is a topological space, covered by open subsets V_j, and if we are
| given on each V_j a manifold structure such that for each pair j, j' the
| induced structure on V_j |^| V_j' coincides, then it is clear that we can
| give to X a unique manifold structure inducing the given ones on each V_j.
|
| If X, Y are two manifolds, then one can give the
| product X x Y a manifold structure in the obvious way.
| If {(U_i, q_i)} and {(V_j, r_j)} are atlases for X, Y
| respectively, then
|
| {(U_i x V_j, q_i x r_j)}
|
| is an atlas for the product, and the product of compatible
| atlases gives rise to compatible atlases, so that we do get
| a well-defined product structure.
|
| Let X, Y be two manifolds.  Let f : X -&gt; Y be a map.
| We shall say that f is a &quot;C^p-morphism&quot; if, given x in X,
| there exists a chart (U, q) at x and a chart (V, r) at f(x)
| such that f(U) c V, and the map
|
| r o f o q^-1 : qU -&gt; rV
|
| is a C^p-morphism in the sense of Chapter 1, Section 3.
| One sees then immediately that this same condition holds
| for any choice of charts (U, q) at x and (V, r) at f(x)
| such that F(U) c V.
|
| It is clear that the composite of two C^p-morphisms is itself
| a C^p-morphism (because it is true for open subsets of vector
| spaces).  The C^p-manifolds and C^p-morphisms form a category.
| The notion of isomorphism is therefore defined ...
|
| If f : X -&gt; Y is a morphism, and (U, q) is a chart
| at a point x in X, while (V, r) is a chart at f(x),
| then we shall also denote by
|
| f_V,U : qU -&gt; rV
|
| the map rfq^-1 [that is, r o f o q^-1].
| 
| Lang, DARM, page 22.
|
| It is also convenient to have a local terminology.
| Let U be an open set (of a manifold or a Banach space)
| containing a point x_0.  By a &quot;local isomorphism&quot; at x_0
| we mean an isomorphism
|
| f : U_1 -&gt; V
|
| from some open set U_1 containing x_0 (and contained in U)
| to an open set V (in some manifold or some Banach space).
| Thus a local isomorphism is essentially a change of chart,
| locally near a given point.
