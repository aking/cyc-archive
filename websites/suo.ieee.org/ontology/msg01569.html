Michael,
   This is interesting.  I saw Doug just a month ago and he hadn't 
mentioned this.  Where did he make this announcement?  Did he give any 
detail about the license he plans to release Cyc under?  Will it be truly 
open source using the GNU Public License?
   If and when portions of Cyc get released, and if the legal framework is 
such that it can be used freely, I think it would make great sense to merge 
that content with the SUO content at that point.
   One point of clarification on different approaches on the SUO I'd like 
to make regards the term "monolithic".  I think that's a bit too pejorative 
a term to characterize what anyone is advocating.  My view is simply that 
we should *try* to create a single coherent ontology.  Although we've had 
some very interesting discussion about different approaches, I suspect that 
the number of truly incompatible theories, that are themselves useful, are 
very few.  Notwithstanding Pat's paper cataloguing different temporal 
theories, there's been very little precise characterization in logic of 
what some different theories might be, and how they might be 
incompatible.  Until we have clear evidence that a single coherent ontology 
is impossible, I think it would be wrong to abandon that goal.

&gt;I'm afraid that I have been unable to get to any SUO mail lately, but
&gt;I did have a peek at this message from Nicola - promoting a non-monolithic
&gt;approach which emphasizes understanding and relating ontologies, rather than
&gt;agreeing on a single one.
&gt;
&gt;If it turns out that this is agreed by a everyone, this could have a major
&gt;shift in our emphasis and activity.
&gt;
&gt;There is another possibly very important development which I believe we should
&gt;take into consideration.  Doug Lenat recently announced that they will be
&gt;giving away Cyc. There will be a new organization called OpenCyc.org which 
&gt;will
&gt;oversee this.  They are not going to give it all away at once, because they
&gt;need to have a viable business. Instead, they will give away different pieces
&gt;with varying amounts of detail.  Every quarter, more will be released. The
&gt;first release is scheduled for July 2001.  They are trying to get the balance
&gt;right between giving it away soon enough so that noone is motivated to build
&gt;their own.  It is the only game in town. They do not want to give stuff 
&gt;away so
&gt;soon, that every company who might do business with Cyc will just wait, rather
&gt;than pay for early access.  This way, Cyc will defacto be the worlds standard
&gt;UO and common sense Knowledge Base.  They are using the Linux model for open
&gt;software, as their main starting point - adapting only insofar as there are
&gt;important differences between software and a KB.
&gt;
&gt;How does this affect the SUO effort?  For those that advocate a non-monolithic
&gt;approach, it Cyc will merely become one of those that need to be 
&gt;available, and
&gt;related to other ontologies. For those advocating a monolithic one single SUO,
&gt;it can have much greater import.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From time to time, people have said, why do we need another UO, when we 
&gt; already
&gt;have Cyc.  Well, Cyc existed, but it was not really avaliable. This was an
&gt;excellent reason, to continue to pursue SUO. However, now that it WILL be
&gt;available, a very loooooong time before this group is likely to come up with a
&gt;viable alternative, it raises the question in a new light: Why build another
&gt;SUO if we have Cyc?
&gt;
&gt;I belive that before much more energy goes into building our SUO, 'we' should
&gt;instead do a systematic and thorough investigation of CYC, and answer the 
&gt;above
&gt;question. The answer might be, there is no reason to build another
&gt;UO. Alternatively, it should take the form of a thorough critique of Cyc
&gt;indicating the shortcomings, and why it is insufficient (if it is) and how it
&gt;needs to be augmented or replaced by a 'real' SUO..
&gt;
&gt;An alternative thread of activity can be as Nicola recommends, to spend time
&gt;relating alternatives, and work towards a library of reference ontologies, one
&gt;of which will be Cyc.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;PS PLEASE include me explicitly on any responses on this topic to ensure 
&gt;that I
&gt;will look at it promptly. Otherwise it will may remain unopened along with a
&gt;sea of other SUO messages.
