Bernard--

I don't think you should conclude too much from the fact that the whole
group did not jump at the chance to comment on your question about
cross-cultural perceptions of time.  I think that some of your more
fundamental issues were a bit masked by being subordinated in a narrow
debate about how to represent the cutoff time for a parliamentary
procedure.

Let me respond to one aspect of your concern, that of intentionality.  I
have mentioned several times on this list that intention should be
fundamental (part of the kernel, as we are now starting to speak).  I have
tried to make the case that the ontology we are working on should be the
framework for myriad domain-specific ontologies, and that what separates
one domain from another is largely a matter of intent.

I also appreciate your reference to Prigogine.  I have tried on occasion to
introduce the concept of system to this list, which I think is a concept
which, if not in the kernel, is at least very central.  At one point I
introduced a list of, I think about 100 distinctions among different types
of systems, extracted from an encyclopedia of systems studies.  This
particular note was passed over entirely without comment by the group.

I have almost stopped writing this kind of note, because the standard
response is that I should write a rigorous axiomatization and submit it to
the (now so-called) SUMO.  My situation barely affords the time to read
this list, and no time for such detailed work.  I agree with John Sowa, as
well, on the point that some discussions and agreement on the basic shape
is in order before running off in all directions with apparently rigorous
elaboration.

The bottom line for this note:  I think that differentiation of various
types of intentionality is an important piece of work, which, in turn, will
provide important differentiation for various types of systems, as well as
for various ontological domains.

I don't feel your remarks and questions as off-topic. To know if intention,
awareness, purpose versus random, instinct, physical process should be a
major ontological distinction is not IMO a minor question. And it is really
a good example of where the cultural context does weigh on the ontology,
and
even if the global feedback (or absence of feedback) I got on this question
lately seems to indicate that most people on this forum consider such
questions as being out of scope, I'll stick to the viewpoint that they are
not.

If you have an animist-pantheist view of the world, the intentionality is
as
present in the willow growth or constellations patterns than in the
building
of a temple. If you have a positivist-reductionist view of the world, there
is no more intentionality in any of those than in any other, because the
notion of intentionality is considered as irrelevant altogether.
Between those two extremes is a middle path that most people today I think
implicitly agree to walk on, where the frontier between "random physical
process" and "intentional process" is a very fuzzy one, depending on one's
undecidable arguments about what one considers to be intentional.
Controverses on universe and life evolution, anthropic principle (weak or
strong), Gaia, Global Brain and others of the same kind show that even
physical processes in the early hot universe may be considered by some
people as "early intentions".
One interesting cutting approach is to be found in Thermodynamics (works of
Prigogine and others), a cutoff being possible between near-equilibrium
processes well described by statistical laws (first and second
thermodynamic
principles: a crowd in panic maybe in this case if people are considered as
particles with random moves commanded by pression, temperature and volume),
and far-for-equilibrium complex processes like air transport regulation,
football games, bird migrations and forest growth. Such a cutoff is maybe
the less culturally biased possible among the presently available
distinctions, in the sense that it can be grounded on somehow measurable
characteristics, not on undecidable judgments.

But the name we will give those categories will be loaded anyway. Not
mentioning purpose anywhere in the classification of processes - sticking
to
thermodynamics categories - would make this classification irrelevant
wherever the users will want to declare intentionality (because in their
view of the world, there is intentionality), and moreover would implicitly
declare that intentionality in itself is a somehow irrelevant concept. So
maybe we have to keep intentionality as a (possible) attribute of process,
but abstain to declare which classes of process - if any - have this
property, letting it open to every user.

This is IMO just one aspect of the problem of cultural context. We have
many
undecidable propositions of that kind at the upper level. I would tend to
consider that undecidability is even a *characteristic* of the upper level.
Otherwise, the work we are on would have been achieved centuries ago.
Culture is built on what a community agrees on about the major undecidable.
So either we try to be the less culturally biased and build a deliberately
ambiguous and fuzzy ontology, leaving open and available every choice about
undecidable propositions, and letting every user choose whatever fits one's
community view of the world, either we build a "unique thought" efficient
fit-all consensual ontology, cutting of the undecidable in an axiomatic
(dogma
tic?) way.

My hunch is that the market would be happy with the latter, and the
civilization with the former ... but I digress :o)
