Martin, John, etc.,
	.			This looks like solid progress. 

	.	The ideas of having "generic relationship concept"
("relationship type" in normal data modelling parlance), and "relationship
instance" (just "relationship" in normal data modelling parlance) make good
sense, and fit in well with the normal data modelling terminology many
people use. It does, however, mean that the traditional "entity -
relationship diagram (ERD)" now becomes an "entity - relationship type
diagram". 

	.	The third item looks to me like "the set of all instances of
a relationship having the nominated "generic relationship concept". I take
it this is what is proposed for "relation". 

	.	If I am understanding this correctly, then the "generic
relationship concept" (or "relationship type") will be the same as the
"generic relation concept" (or "relation type"). Is this intended? 

	.	Can anyone: 
*	come up with improved (clearer &amp; more succinct) wordings for the
definitions? and 
*	provide examples with -arity = 1 and -arity &gt; 3? 

	.	I ask this because I believe we should have good solid
simple and unambiguous definitions that leave nothing to be puzzled over or
guessed at. 

	.	I would prefer that the SUO terminology is compatible with
data modelling paradigm as much as possible. I say this in view of the
amount of database development undertaken these days, using such ordinary
"Office" software products as MS Access and Lotus Approach, which most
people have on their work and home computers. 

	.	This also seems appropriate to me since the SUO scope
includes: "This standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable
computers to utilize it for applications such as data interoperability,
information search and retrieval, .......". 

	.	The purpose is also heavily data centric, as can be seen
below.




============================================
Revised Scope as at 25 Nov '00 (Jim, are these the latest?):
This standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable computers to
utilize it for applications such as data interoperability, information
search and retrieval, automated inferencing, and natural language
processing. An ontology is similar to a dictionary or glossary, but with
greater detail and structure that enables computers to process its content.
An ontology consists of a set of concepts, axioms, and relationships that
describe a domain of interest. An upper ontology is limited to concepts that
are meta, generic, abstract and philosophical, and therefore are general
enough to address (at a high level) a broad range of domain areas. Concepts
specific to given domains will not be included; however, this standard will
provide a structure and a set of general concepts upon which domain
ontologies (e.g. medical, financial, engineering, etc.) could be
constructed. 
Purpose: (Why the standard needs to be developed and who will benefit.)
A.	AUTOMATED REASONING: The standard will be suitable for automated
logical inference to support knowledge-based reasoning applications. 
B.	INTER-OPERABILITY: The standard will provide a basis for achieving
Inter-Operability among various software and database applications.
1)	Application developers can define new data elements in terms of a
common ontology, and thereby gain some degree of interoperability with other
conformant systems.
2)	Applications based on domain-specific ontologies that are compliant
with this standard will be able to interoperate (to some degree) by virtue
of the shared common terms and definitions. 
3)	The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange format whereby
owners of existing applications will be able to map existing data elements
just once to a common ontology. This provides a degree of interoperability
with other applications whose representations conform to SUO.
This entails the SUO being able to be mapped to more restricted forms such
as XML, database schema, or object oriented schema.
C: APPLICATION AREAS
1)	E-commerce applications from different domains that need to
interoperate at both the data and semantic levels. 
2)	Educational applications in which students learn concepts and
relationships directly from, or expressed in terms of, a common ontology.
This will also enable a standard record of learning to be kept. 
3)	Natural language understanding tasks in which a knowledge based
reasoning system uses the ontology to disambiguate among likely
interpretations of natural language statements.

I strongly support what John Sowa has to say here.

I will just add a reply to Matthew that in my mind my words describing the
three concepts were based on the naive realism assumption to refer to the
real world as far as is possible.  I can see how they can be interpreted as
referring to representations of the real world, but I recommend avoiding
this.  I would also point out that John Velman's response to my
contribution, although in some sense was a useful paraphrase of my words, in
fact has moved strongly to referring to the representation rather than the
real world.  I show extracts of both below for comparison.

Bottom line (in NL at least, but I think SUO/KIF too)) is try to write as if
it is the real world is the referent, even the way you have to write it is
predicated on a particular style of representation.  This may sound like a
"cop out", but for me it is more a "sleight of hand" that works.

Yours, Martin

MK words
&gt;
&gt; 1. A generic relationship concept (e.g. Customer), sometimes
&gt; called relationship type
&gt;
&gt; 2. A specific instance of a relationship concept (e.g. Martin
&gt; King is a customer of Singapore Airlines)
&gt;
&gt; 3. A population of relationship instances (e.g. all customers
&gt; of Singapore Airlines), close to the concept of class
&gt;
JV words
A relation of arity n, n&gt;0,  is symbolized as predicate with n arguments.
The extension of a relation of arity 1 is the set of things in the domain of
quantification for which the predicate is true.  The  extension of a
relation of arity n&gt;1 is the subset of the nfold cartesian product of the
domain of quantification for which the predicate is true.

A relationship is an instance of a relation.    E.g.,  married(X,Y)
describes a relation. married(Bill, Hillary) describes a relationship.

Matthew, Mike, et al.,

That is a very serious and very difficult question:

&gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call what it is in the
real

&gt;world that they refer to?

As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box
of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
Java, etc.

But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they
refer to in the real world?" all hell breaks loose.

You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?

Suggestion:

 1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
    interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
    satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
    is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.

 2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
    purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
    realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
    words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
    let's not worry too much about what it is.

 3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
    the position that KIF is the official language to be used
    for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
    If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.

I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out"
that doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the
same cop out that Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his
Tractatus:  "Everything that can be said can be said clearly,
and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent."

For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some
extra prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in
the SUO] can be said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot
speak [in KIF], thereof we must be silent.

This is not an answer to the question of what do relations
really refer to.  It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the
only kind of cop out that will allow us to get some work done.

John Sowa
