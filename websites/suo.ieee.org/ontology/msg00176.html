Dear Douglas, 
	.	I'm afraid, your speculation on "what I think may be your
main thesis" is way off track. But, while you're there, I will elaborate a
bit, in the vague hope it may elaborate my perspective.  

	.	There are several sources for ambiguity in communication. 
1.	multiple meanings for individual words (which think of roughly as
lexical ambiguity, and is often because we can encompass more meanings by
use of metaphors), and I can think of two basic types: 
a.	specific different meanings, eg "hock", and 
b.	meanings that are not precise, as exemplified by the haziness
regarding the overlapping dictionary meanings of "administration",
"management" and  "control", which could be assisted by amending their
defined meanings to provide clearly distinctive aspects differentiating
them,
2.	multiple meanings for particular text structures (which I think of
roughly as semantic ambiguity); 
3.	deliberate use of expressions by the author to simultaneously infer,
or allow, more than one meaning from a piece of text, eg. 
a.	a double entendre, often used for artistic purposes, or 
b.	use of a hazy description to precisely reflect a hazy comprehension
of what one is trying to communicate; 
4.	lack of education of the author and or the recipient, which can be
broken down into:
a.	lack of linguistic education (what particular words mean, and/or
when to use them), and 
b.	lack of general education, so that the implications of different
concepts are incompletely and/or erroneously understood, 
5.	laziness on the part of the author in terms of not using the correct
terminology to indicate their meaning, sometimes causing considerable
trouble, and
6.	expediency on the part of the author in terms of not using the
correct terminology to indicate their meaning, due to lapses of memory, or
time or other pressures. 

	.	Regarding point 4, when, some while ago, I described a
reduction in the level of teaching of formal grammar, my comments were
derided by some SUO participants - the words "utterly bizarre" were used. 
*	It so happens that a work colleague adjacent me had no formal
grammar training at school, having attended during the period when teaching
of grammar was banned in at least one Australian state. He assures me he has
no idea of how to parse an English sentence. Not surprisingly, his
inclination is that English is an Amorphous collection of words of almost
infinite applicability. Essentially, he uses words "because they sound right
under the circumstances". I might add, that as a software man, he is quite
capable of parsing computer code. 
*	By comparison, I was taught formal grammar at school. Another
colleague here has just lent me a recent grammar text, from since it was
reintroduced into the school curriculum there. The preface talks of "both
traditional and functional grammars", but it has the basic structures I
remember being taught. 
*	I put it to you that people without a knowledge of the structural
basis of formalised grammar are disadvantaged in precisely, and hence
accurately, comprehending texts. This is especially when any unusual
structure is used. I would not favour the richness of language being
"enriched" by people being educationally disadvantaged and unable to express
what they wish to say. I would see that as a human rights issue needing
correction. 

	.	Similarly, regarding point 5, when someone is lazy in
language usage, the recipient is disadvantaged in precisely, and hence
accurately, comprehending what was meant. 

	.	Basically, I am opposed to points 1b, 2, 4 and 5. In my
opinion, 1a and 3 allow the richness of human communication. I also see 6 as
only a reasonable symptom of the human condition. 

	.	So, I am talking about the ability to communicate precisely.
However, I am definitely not requiring that it has to be done. That is a big
difference. I would be opposed to any hindrance to the many benefits to
society afforded by deliberate ambiguity. 

	.	I hope you can see the basis of my approach, and that it
does not involve the issues that you rightly oppose.

Graham-
You have jumped on a relatively narrow side discussion about programming
languages and polysemy to advance the argument that you have been
propounding here at some length.  As long as you are on this argument, let
me change the thread, and respond directly to what I think may be your main
thesis.
At one point I thought you were in search of a language that was less
ambiguous than natural language for certain narrowly defined domains that
require a high degree of non-ambiguity.  Now it seems that maybe you have an
expectation that such a constrictive, restrictive and mechanistic expression
vehicle might and should spread to encompass all of human communication.
If your purpose is the former, I think it would be useful to spell out
(again?) the conditions under which you envision such a mechanism to be
useful and desirable.  The law?  Business transactions?  Courtship?
If you are actually advocating the latter position. you may count me, most
vociferously, among those who oppose your program.  In your note below you
say, "I gather by the silence of many, that they just regard it as fantasy.
"  If you are really proposing your envisioned mechanistic approach for all
human communication, this is not a fantasy.  It is a nightmare.  It is also
not possible, thankfully.
At another time I may take the time to expand on my view of why this is
impossible.  But to put a finer point on the nightmarish aspect of the
broader interpretation (if this is really what you mean), let me quote you
from later in your note, "If I say something to you in a computer language
in which you are literate, you will know exactly what the instructions are,
and how to carry out the functions (assuming you know the mathematical
algorithms involved)."  Surely this can't be your view of the nature of all
and any human communication.  So I'll assume that you have some narrowly
defined domains in mind where it makes sense for people to communicate this
way, and that you may take the time to list a few of them for us.

Norbert,
     .    Comments interspersed, prefaced "GH&gt;     ".

     .    I am trying to explain a concept that is evidently extremely
foreign to almost all SUO participants. I gather by the silence of many,
that they just regard it as fantasy. That doesn't discourage me from the
conviction that the concept is valid, until someone demonstrates a logically
provable flaw in the logic of my premise.
.    It requires absolute rigour by any human wishing to gain the full
precision the approach can provide. Initially, the scope of coverage will be
significantly limited as the cost of that precision. That is the price one
pays for developing an unambiguous language. Extensions to cover greater
scope happen incrementally, and may even require restructures as new demands
outgrow the capacities of earlier structures. Similar developments occur
over time with most software of advancing sophistication.

Graham
We may have misunderstood each other. Let me try to clarify my point of
view.
At 20:52 +1100 00/12/12, Horn, Graham wrote:
&gt;Norbert,
&gt;    .    I can feel the fuzzy approach you are taking here.

I did not at all intend to advocate the fuzzy approach.
GH&gt;  By "fuzzy", I was referring to the absence of the requirement of any
human for the absolute rigour I mentioned above.
&gt;    .    Nevertheless, if code (and the underlying language) is
&gt;correctly written, the computer will consistently interpret it only
&gt;one way, and only produce one result (with the exception of
&gt;random number generators, or programs that involve aspects
&gt;dependent on previous calculations)

Agreed, but you wrote "if I communicate to you in a computer language in
which you are literate, surely you will understand precisely what I say?"
and I took it that by "you" you meant a human being which is a completely
different situation.
GH&gt;  Yes, I did mean that. If I say something to you in a computer language
in which you are literate, you will know exactly what the instructions are,
and how to carry out the functions (assuming you know the mathematical
algorithms involved). Even if you are a human, this will still be so.
GH&gt;  I truly believe, especially in restricted frames of reference, that
unambiguous communication is possible between humans (I'm beginning to think
I'm the only person on the planet who believes that). Certainly I believe
that for any well-formed computer language.
&gt;    .    I am a strong supporter of the (now old fashioned) approach
&gt;of documenting program code, including explanations of the 
&gt;reasonings behind approaches taken.
&gt;
&gt;    .    Yes, that documentation will be ambiguous, but it won't be
&gt;actual code, will it? Therefore, the statement I made won't apply to it.
&gt;
&gt;    .    I am intrigued by amount of weight and emphasis many
&gt;contributions to this project place on what others have said.
&gt;Such contributions seem almost to take the line that the 
&gt;statements must be right because someone else wrote them.

I wish I had formulated Hall's statement because he expresses exactly my
convictions that form an essential part of the philosophy that led to
Attempto  Controlled English.
Please, note that ACE has a dual face: on the one side it is English, on the
other side a formal language. Thus ACE can play at the same time the role of
code (formal notation) and commentary (explaining the formal notation in
human terms).
GH&gt;  I understand that, and certainly expect that that would be possible
with any well-formed unambiguous language, whether it borrows from the
formal version of a "natural" language, or whether it is based on a
"logical" symbology.
GH&gt;  I suspect the difference with my approach is that I start from zero,
and build up to a controlled language that has attributes borrowed from a
natural language, while NEVER taking any ambiguous aspect within its own
frame of reference. So long as the user is literate in the controlled
language they will know that there is only one meaning of any word and
grammatical construction.
GH&gt;  I suspect that others start from the whole of the natural language, and
then try to interpret the controlled version from that basis. For
unambiguous communication that approach is prohibited. I suggest humans are
capable of learning to comply with the absolutely rigid rules when
interpreting the controlled version. For example, I am confident that, given
a calculator with (exactly) the same precision, I could read and follow some
program code , and come up with the identical answer(s).
GH&gt;  This is crucial to my proposition. If you can accept that, you will be
able to comprehend the feasibility of what I am proposing.
&gt;    .    While I acknowledge that we are in an area that involves
&gt;logical implications, some of which I will be unaware, I prefer
&gt;statements that stand on the basis of well argued logic with
&gt;demonstrable soundness, and I acknowledge refutations 
&gt;demonstrating superior soundness. It may not be possible to be
&gt;black and white, but it should be possible to  at least be
&gt;extremely dark grey or extremely light grey, with only the 
&gt;slightest tints of any colours.

Please recall that we try to formalise domains of the real world that are
not formal at all. It remains our task to relate the formalisation to the
domain (in humanly understandable ways), which as we know cannot be done in
a unique way.
GH&gt;  I agree. However, by starting from zero, one can construct precise
definitions for every word. To start with there will be many things one just
cannot communicate with the controlled language. Gradually, one will
construct more and more ways of stating more and more different types of
concepts.
GH&gt;  The approach I am suggesting is one requiring absolute rigour and
discipline. Nevertheless, it will make texts generally less ambiguous than
ordinary texts, even to ordinary people, especially as they get to
understand that so many of their alternative interpretations are not valid.
Also, there will be a tendency to avoid those natural language words and
constructions that, in the natural language, are subject to multiple
interpretations.
GH&gt;  Everything you have shown me so far about ACE is able to be interpreted
unambiguously within its own frame of reference, EVEN BY A HUMAN WHO KNOWS
ITS RULES. This demonstrates exactly the precision that is required by the
sort of controlled language I have always been suggesting.  I am very
impressed with the work you and your team have achieved.
Best regards.
