Ian,

I think Chris' issue of practical purpose is distinguisable from domain
focus (science/engineering).  It might be useful to make sure we all have
a shared sense of the main purposes to be served, among the several that
have been put forth now and in the past: 

search
sense  disambiguation
inference
  within the SUO to how many levels
  penetrating into domain ontologies
pedagogy
interlingual core
knowledge discovery

Assuming the SUO to be completed and approved, which of these would it
support and to what extent?

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Here is my response to Chris Partridge's claim that the "Merged
&gt; Ontology" is not "sufficiently conceptually consistent" and does not have a
&gt; "practical purpose".  First of all, I'm sure that there are cases of
&gt; inconsistency in the latest version of the "Merged Ontology", i.e. there are
&gt; bound to be cases of axioms and/or subsumption relations contradicting one
&gt; another.  I don't know where these inconsistencies are, since I've
&gt; eliminated the ones that I've found myself and the ones that have been
&gt; brought to my attention by others.  Nevertheless, it is a large and complex
&gt; document, and there are undoubtedly contradictions lurking somewhere.
&gt; Though Chris and I agree about the presence of inconsistency in the "Merged
&gt; Ontology", we apparently disagree about how to handle this inconsistency.
&gt; To my mind, the remaining cases of contradiction should be resolved
&gt; point-by-point rather than by tossing out everything that has been done thus
&gt; far.  As for the criticism that the "Merged Ontology" lacks a "practical
&gt; purpose", I think this misses the mark.  The "Merged Ontology" includes many
&gt; high-level concepts that have a direct application in science and
&gt; engineering contexts, e.g. a biological taxonomy, formal notions of units of
&gt; measure, mathematical functions, and temporal axioms.  Furthermore, all of
&gt; these practical concepts have been tied into a single, compact lattice of
&gt; concepts/axioms that allows these more practical concepts to draw from the
&gt; same store of semantic content.  If there are some high-level concepts that
&gt; are lacking in the document and that are needed in science/engineering
&gt; contexts, I would be happy to include them.

&gt; &gt; Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat and John 
&gt; &gt; say - is not
&gt; &gt; sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as 
&gt; &gt; Matthew says - does

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that - as it stands - the Ontology is not 
&gt; &gt; really a standard
&gt; &gt; that is fit for any practical purpose.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of making concrete
&gt; &gt; suggestions via email is adequate for the task at hand. A point that a
&gt; &gt; number of people have made in the past.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete 
&gt; &gt; suggestion for a way
&gt; &gt; to produce an adequate product. I think the task is of a size 
&gt; &gt; that anything
&gt; &gt; I would suggest would involve the old standards such as a project with
&gt; &gt; resources and a plan that gave some substance to the process 
&gt; &gt; of analysis to
&gt; &gt; be followed and the deliverables. But there is no point in 
&gt; &gt; starting this
&gt; &gt; unless there is some kind of commitment in terms of resources.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; Chris
