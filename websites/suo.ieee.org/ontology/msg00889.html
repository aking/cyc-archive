Pat,

I am going to take a break from that rather grueling history lecture --
which you may take at any rate, at least, provisionally, as nothing more
serious than the liturgical mythology and the strained reconstruction of
a particular tradition, as you would, of course, any other presentation
of the "true history of events" (THOE) in any other domain of secular
human contention -- and try to see if there are any more points of
your note that I can now address more directly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My only addition is a suggestion that we use KIF
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the base language of signs for the purpose of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the SUO, and we define the terms in other languages,
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as English, conceptual graphs, etc., by their
&gt; &gt; &gt; translation to KIF.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I repeat my earlier caveat:  This proposal does
&gt; &gt; &gt; not solve any philosophical problems, it doesn't answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; any linguistic questions, and it makes no claim that KIF
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the best language for everything that one might want
&gt; &gt; &gt; to use a language for.  But it allows the work on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUO to proceed.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; KIF, in the shape that we currently know it, and, for that matter,
&gt; &gt; most of the popular systems for expressing FOL, are not languages
&gt; &gt; that I can think in, for the reason that they preclude me, either
&gt; &gt; through their deliberate inexpressiveness or their computational
&gt; &gt; inefficiency, from being able to address the research issues that
&gt; &gt; are of pressing concern and present interest to me, like whether
&gt; &gt; the functional (procedural) and the logical (declarative) aspects
&gt; &gt; of computational (in the broadest sense) languages can be better
&gt; &gt; integrated than they currently are, just to name a single issue
&gt; &gt; that leaps to mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon, first let me thank you for expressing yourself
&gt; with such clarity.  But to turn to the substance,
&gt; I wonder what kind of limitation you find in KIF?
&gt; KIF 3.0 (not ANSI-KIF, or the SUO-KIF core, both
&gt; of which are highly stripped down to their simplest
&gt; basics) must be one of the most expressive formal
&gt; languages ever defined.  It is capable of describing
&gt; its own syntax(like LISP), it has the strongest
&gt; consistent truth-predicate I have ever seen,
&gt; it has upward and downward reflection.
&gt; What more can you possibly want?

Let me just try to start here a more casual rendition
of what is bound to become a very formal animadversion
on another strand of this very same thread.

I would like to broach the subjects of "Efficiency" and "Elegance".
Strange as it may seem, there is a positively reinforcing relation
between the pair, and so you might say that I am a believer in the
aesthetic-efficient, "kleeneliness next to gödeliness", maxim that:
&lt;Function Follows Form Follows&gt;*.

After some early and very bad experiences with Fortran and Cobol,
I somewhat later worked up the resolve to return to computational
approaches to mathematics solely because there had arisen in my
work in the meantime too many mathematical questions to which
I just had to know some kind of answer, and which it became
clear that I just could not achive through my own devices,
without building more devices, that is.  Well, I imagine
that you know what happens -- I never goy back to those
instigative questions, but I can still remember what
they were, and I have a better sense of the orders
of theoretical power, in the sense of implemented
pers-picacity, that it would take to return to
them -- and I am just nowhere near there yet.

In a sense, this has more to do with "selectivity",
yet another way of saying "elegance", than it does
with rawsome "generativity".

&gt; (Higher-order quantifiers?  Type theory?)

Just a hint as to what I would like to see in these connections:
There is a way of extending ZOL in the general direction of FOL,
perhaps not entirely getting there, but establishing a logistic
resource of useful base-camps, way-stations, or stepping-stones
along the path, in a sense, by pitonning the "fractional orders"
that one can see between the Zeroth of ZOL and the First of FOL.
This is an old idea that goes back to the beginning of the last
century, but the basic insight is documented in Quine's article
on the computational complexity of propositional calculus which
was collected in his little anthology on 'Theories and Things'.

&gt; I concede that it might not be the most elegant
&gt; language (although trying to do better has given
&gt; me a lot more respect for it:  designing elegant
&gt; languages isn't an easy task), but you don't
&gt; criticise it on aesthetic grounds.

Well, actually, I do.
But I was saving the
best of my critiques,
after Kant, for last!

&gt; And for a Peircian, surely it's having been
&gt; aligned with CG's must give it some brownie points.

Ah well, there's alignment,
and then there's alignment.

&gt; You say you are interested in integrating
&gt; functional and declarative aspects of languages,
&gt; which is also a central interest of mine.  Even here,
&gt; KIF is worthy of a little careful study (although this goes
&gt; way beyond what is needed for the SUO enterprise, I believe).

If the SUO Enterprise has any need to engage in difficult inquiries --
basically "inquiry" is just a word that I use for "scientific method",
or any rudimentary hint of it, while trying to finesse, at the outset,
at least, all of that Feyerabender Fuss as to whether there really is
a method tuit atoll -- then the SUO Enterprise will eventually need
software that is tailored to the task of inquiry, and for that it
will find itself of needing to meet the reqs &amp; the specs of what
I am talking about here.

Have to take a break from my break --
a "meta-break"? -- just fora while --

Jon Awbrey
