Dear Jon,

Unfortunately it is not enough when you and I agree :-(

See comments below.

&gt; &gt; &gt; | the real world that they refer to?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  "Matthew"  is a sign that denotes Matthew   (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt;  "x"        is a sign that denotes x         (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt;  "&lt;x, y&gt;"   is a sign that denotes &lt;x, y&gt;    (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt;  "R"        is a sign that denotes {&lt;x, y&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; in R} (ITRW).
&gt; &gt; &gt; '"Matthew"' is a sign that denotes "Matthew" (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; '"x"'       is a sign that denotes "x"       (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; '"&lt;x, y&gt;"'  is a sign that denotes "&lt;x, y&gt;"  (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt; '"R"'       is a sign that denotes '"R"'     (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There's a pattern here.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Yes, there is a pattern in the examples you have given,
&gt; &gt; but it does not always hold.  It is quite common to see
&gt; &gt; a pattern of the sort:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "&lt;x, y&gt;"               denotes x in the real world or
&gt; &gt; "&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes a in the real world
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is perhaps worth remembering that this discussion
&gt; &gt; started with Graham saying that activities WERE relations,
&gt; &gt; where as I was saying that we sometimes represented activities
&gt; &gt; as relations, where the relation really contains a number of things
&gt; &gt; the activity is related to, including perhaps a reference to itself,
&gt; &gt; but not other representation, which is not quite the same.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; I do want to be taken as trying to zing you on account of some zing
&gt; that somebody else did to me  -- I always really hate it, myself,
&gt; when somebody does that to me -- but what you said merely went
&gt; to remind me of a rather old and tiresome problem, one that
&gt; I wish that we all could get past, and I feel like I have
&gt; already contributed my darnedest bit of yarn to trying
&gt; to untangle it -- all to such little aveil, alas! --
&gt; and perhaps the antic frustrations of not being
&gt; able to rend this "antic issue" (AI) a toile
&gt; that would one day be of the "said &amp; done"
&gt; variety and all of the kindred ambivalent
&gt; "sanguinity" bled through just a bit into
&gt; bloody irony, but I simply wish that we
&gt; could see through it all -- I tried to
&gt; give the Inquistive my scope on the
&gt; objects of our earnest attention,
&gt; but none are so blinkered by the
&gt; orbs of their vision as those
&gt; who tremble before imaginary
&gt; daimons, the ones that they
&gt; imagine inhabit the scopes,
&gt; never seeing 'tis the eyes
&gt; that habit what they see.
&gt; 
&gt; But let me try to focus on what you say now:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Yes, there is a pattern in the examples you have given,
&gt; &gt; but it does not always hold.  It is quite common to see
&gt; &gt; a pattern of the sort:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "&lt;x, y&gt;"               denotes x in the real world or
&gt; &gt; "&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes a in the real world
&gt; 
&gt; I do not think that I would call it "quite common to see",
&gt; and although I believe that I may have run across a few
&gt; expressions that appear, from a certain angle, distance,
&gt; or perspective to look roughly or superfically similar
&gt; to these, 

MW: Let us consider specifics. Every transaction processing system I have
seen, where a transaction is an activity, looks like this. So it is quite
common really. It may also be quite efficient.

&gt; I tend to suspect that the people who write
&gt; them -- I cannot guarantee that it was not me, too! --
&gt; are just being careless, or casual, or loose in their
&gt; canon, that probably they meant to write something else,
&gt; and that the job of reflection on expressions is to help
&gt; them -- or help myself, as the case may be! -- to untangle
&gt; their sense and, as Bobby Burns say, "to mend their ways".

MW: I agree, and this is what I was trying to do if you look back far
enough.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; It is perhaps worth remembering that this discussion
&gt; &gt; started with Graham saying that activities WERE relations,
&gt; &gt; where as I was saying that we sometimes represented activities
&gt; &gt; as relations, where the relation really contains a number of things
&gt; &gt; the activity is related to, including perhaps a reference to itself,
&gt; &gt; but not other representation, which is not quite the same.
&gt; 
&gt; But, really, I cannot be responsible for the ways that other 
&gt; people talk!

MW: No, all we can do (and perhaps should do) is note that some peoples
usage is that:

"&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes   a   in the real world

We can then use this to trasform their view to ours (or just mine if ours is
optimistic).

&gt; I can talk till I am truly "blue of face" (BOF), but, without 
&gt; the purple
&gt; tinge of authority, who under heaven would listen up to my 
&gt; scarlet prose?

MW: The key issue here is what is communicated rather than what is sent. We
need people to go "ah ha" not simply "ugh".
&gt; 
&gt; I can think that I see a way to untangle this --
&gt; I can send pages and pages to the purpose --
&gt; but that is said and done, and so am I --
&gt; to that I am resigned --
&gt; hic et nunc --
&gt; anyway ...
&gt; 
&gt; Many Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
