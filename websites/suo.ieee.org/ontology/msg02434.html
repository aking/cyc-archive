&gt;### John, I concur. I have also stopped contributing and even to some 
&gt;extent reading the messages. There also seems to be a matter that nobody
&gt;is willing to mention explicitly? Since I subscribed on Jan. 16, I
&gt;received 2256 messages from SUO. Of these, 452 were generated by one
&gt;person.

That is over 550 messages per month.  Deleting 452 would leave
about 450 per month -- still far too many to deal with.

Adam Pease wrote:

&gt; If all the conversation which isn't relevant to the standard were
&gt; moved to ontology@ieee.org that would help a great deal.

Moving discussions from one list to another won't help reduce the
volume because most people don't want to miss the good stuff (which
could pop up on any one of the five SUO lists).

Phil Jackson wrote:

&gt;... under the proposed approach, nothing would prevent the one person
&gt;who has generated 452 messages to SUO from posting hundreds of new
&gt;stories with abstacts on the main page. This might similarly overwhelm
&gt;the readers of the main page, even if stories were archived frequently.

A great many of those 452 messages were continuations of a much
smaller number of major threads, and many of them were useful
comments on other people's threads.  For most of the discussions,
there is about a 10 to 1 ratio of comments per major thread.
That would mean about 45 major articles (each with a one-paragraph
abstract on the main page) over a 4-month period of time.  I don't
think that would overwhelm the Slash format.

Nicola Guarino wrote:

&gt;I AGREE TOTALLY with Robert. I really GOT SICK of this traffic, which 
&gt;is leading nowhere. I am convinced we need a much stronger management 
&gt;effort to implement the working solutions we proposed, and to 
&gt;discourage people from abusing of this list.

That is why I recommended the Slash software.  Once installed, it can
run unattended for long periods of time.  Those people who have passwords
for submitting new articles (with abstracts on the main page) can do so
at any time, and the software automatically posts the article.  Then
anyone else can add comments to any thread at any time.  Such a system
would not require any "manager" to give much attention to it.

John Velman wrote:

&gt;Unfortunately, the Slashdot approach apparently needs
&gt;some active administration.  I'm not sure about the
&gt;newslist approach.

Most of the "active administration" is by the people who are authorized
to post new articles.  That would include all SUO voting members, whose
expenditure of effort would be limited to posting abstracts on the
main page with a pointer to their latest submission.  All comments
would be automatically appended to the secondary pages.

Pat Hayes wrote:

&gt;I recently tried to find some correspondence using this archive. The
&gt;archive is now so full of BS and administrivia that it is very difficult
&gt;to find anything in it, and it has no useful filtering or search capabilities.

The Slash code does have search capabilities.  And the articles
themselves serve as the top node for all the threads under them.

The Slash code has many tailorable options, which the person who
volunteers to do the maintenance could use to add many new features.
It even has automatic polling support for voting.  But the main work
of submitting articles and comments can go on without any help from
an administrator.
