&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A better choice would the 'slices of histories' idea, where 3-d
&gt; &gt; entities are regarded as timeslices of 4-d histories, and one would
&gt; &gt; write
&gt; &gt; (and (married (@Joe 1995) (@ Anne 1995) (not (married (@ Joe 2000)(@
&gt; &gt; Anne 2000))))
&gt; &gt; but this is admittedly somewhat cumbersome; so one can abbreviate it
&gt; &gt; to a situation-calculus style:
&gt; &gt; (and (married Joe Anne 1995)(not (married Joe Anne 2000)))
&gt;
&gt;Is this proposal equivalent to requiring that every predicate have an extra,
&gt;temporal argument that specifies when the relation holds?

No, its actually slightly worse than that, notationally. It requires, 
in its most general form, that every *name* has such an extra 
argument.  Names (of physical things, ie things that have a 
spatiotemporal location, in contrast to things like integers and 
shapes) are understood here to refer to the 4-d spatiotemporal "worm" 
which is simultaneously the thing and its lifetime (there is no 
occurrent/continuant distinction: it can be introduced, but it has no 
deep significance, and the same thing can often be thought of in 
either way.) So the common locution that(R a b) holds at a time t is, 
in this framework, thought of as the (timeless) assertion that the 
t-slice of a and the t-slice of b are in the relation R. Whenever (as 
in this case) the 'slices' being related are contemporary, this can 
be abbreviated in the way you suggest, but one can also state 
relationships between slices at different times: for example, to say 
that I am standing (at time t) where Roosevelt once stood would be 
something like (to revert to functional language for a moment):

(exists( t') (and (= (Place (Pat t)) (Place (Roosevelt t'))) (before t' t) )

(Ive omitted the "@" and just treated every physical entity name as 
being a function from times to its 'temporal pieces'.)

There is a uniform translation from the 'holds' notation into (but 
not from, in general) the 'extra relation argument' notation (which 
is essentially the situation calculus notation, or equivalently what 
you would get if you were to axiomatise the Kripke semantics for a 
temporal modal logic), into (but not from) the temporal-slice (4d) 
notation, illustrated by:

(holds (and (R a b)(R a c)) t)
ie a sentence holds at a time
(and (R a b t)(R a c t))
ie a time-dependent relation is true (timelessly)
(and (R (a t)(b t)) (R (a t)(c t)) )
ie a time-independent relation holds between two temporally located things.

I agree, in case you are thinking this, that the third alternative 
looks rebarbative, which is why I suggested using the second as a 
kind of useful shorthand for 'contemporary' relationships, ie those 
that only hold between things at the same time (what one might call a 
continuant relationship, in fact) (which, BTW, Cyc has made into a 
distinct category for just this reason). Still, it is a very powerful 
basic descriptive framework allowing one to put things like the 
'shapes' of movements ("a sudden turn to the left") into a common 
framework with other spatiotemporal entities. These a, b and c's now, 
you see, can have both spatial and temporal aspects: they can be 
'static' things like mere endurings, or they can be 'dynamic' things 
like motions; and they can be taken apart into their spatiotemporal 
'pieces' in various ways, so that one can easily say things like 
"this part of the machine follows this other part while the cam is 
lifted, but remains stationary otherwise", or "the water continues to 
flow as long as the valve is open."

Pat

PS  If one is really wedded to the occurrent/ continuant distinction, 
it can be phrased here as a rigid classification into two kinds of 4d 
entity: those which 'split' only into timelike pieces (perpendicular 
to the time-axis) and those which split only into spacelike pieces 
(parallel to the time-axis). But if you make this rigid distinction, 
there is little point in having the general case: it gets useful just 
when you want to carve things up a little more carefully than that 
(which is most of the time, in engineering and physical reasoning.).
