JA = Jon Awbrey
JC = Jerry Chandler

JC: Your efforts to express yourself clearly are appreciated.

JC: Nevertheless, I believe that your unique views are flawed from
    a psychological and  a scientific and a logical perspective.

It is also possible that you are making one or two assumptions
about my intended purpose that I have no intentions of meeting.

JA: This an area where I am still trying to get things clear in my own head.
    There are pieces of the puzzle that seem solid by themselves, taken one
    at a time, but that I am still wrestling to fit into a coherent picture.

JC: The jig-saw pieces you are playing with are incomplete from three perspectives:
    logical, scientific, and  psychological.  Attempting to put together a jig-saw
    puzzle without a picture of the whole can be a bit frustrating.

JA: We are conducting an inquiry into the pragma of logic.

JC: You have not made this case at all.  Any pragmatic inquiry into logic requires
    a serious look at the the relations between the cognitive sciences and the basic
    sciences, including mathematics.  Science as a whole and man as a whole.  The case
    for this is well made by Saunders Mac Lane in &quot;Mathematics, Form and Structure&quot;, as
    well as in &quot;Where Mathematics Comes From&quot; by Lakatos and Munzes.

I am asking about the purpose of logic.
Using the Greek &quot;pragma&quot; merely serves
to remind me of many connotations that
I would otherwise forget.

I have taken one or two serious looks into math, psych, and several
other special sciences.  Apart from math, whose nature I cannot yet
even pretend to understand, these are all descriptive sciences, and
their bearing on the normative science of logic is indirect and not
sufficient to determine its character.

JA: The praxis of logic being to address, bring about, or
    capture this object, in other words, to fasten it for
    a moment it in the forms of our human conception, one
    anticipates that the sense of its ending will bear on
    the mean-time conduct of logic as much as the mediate
    struggle of reasoning bears on the pragma in question.

JC: Is this sentence translatable to three words? -- Logic is operational.

More like:  Logic is normative.

JA: If we know the object of logic then it tells us about
    the objectives that logical media ought to facilitate.

JC: Not in category theory.  One distinguishes between objects and morphisms.
    Was it your intent to co-mingle objective and subjective terminology 
    with questions of human values (ought?)?

The distinction between objects and morphisms is not absolute,
but relative to context and interpretation.

Pragma = aim, concern, end, goal, interest, object, objective, purpose, ...

I try to limit my use of the word &quot;subjective&quot; as much
as possible to indicating the subject of a predicate.

JA: Logic being a normative science, an agent pursuing it
    is duly invested with the power to critically reflect
    on different ways of carrying out its procedures, and
    duty bound to examine their comparative effectiveness
    in achieving the overall object of logic.

JC: Why to you believe logic is normative?
    This is a highly individualized view
    for which you have not made the case.

This is a totally classical view and hardly my invention.
In traditional acceptation, the three normative sciences
are aesthetics, ethics, and logic, whose pragmata can be
comprehended as the Good in itself, the Good of a way to
conduct oneself, and the Good of a sign that shows a way.

JA: A critique of anything depends on an ability to make comparisons, and this
    involves an ability to set the thing studied within a setting of generously
    generated alternatives.

JC: I agree.
    But, you neglect the role of reference.
    Frege's &quot;Sinn und Bedeutung&quot;
    Heidigger's A is A and A = A.
    Thus, you are trapped in a circle.

I do not run in those particular circles.
The pragmatic theory of signs provides
an alternative approach to reference.

JA: In sum, a critically reflective logic must empower us
    to consider alternative means for achieving its goals,
    to place side by side a sample of different, but more
    importantly, independent paths toward the same pragma.

JC: No one can be assured that independent paths exist
    without specifying the circumstances.

When it comes to independent paths, there are no assurances.
The regulative principle is:  Seek and ye shall find ...
or not.

JA: Our search into the relation between logos and pragma
    led us to examine the place of logic within a general
    theory of signs:

JC: You schema failures to distinguish between relation and functions.
    If you wish to use lattices, then an asymmetric relation is essential.

Not sure what you mean here, so I will take a guess.
It is sometimes useful to use an abstract symbolism
whose terms are allowed to have dual interpretations
as relations L c X = some cartesian product and also
as functions L : X -&gt; B = {0, 1}.  I used to do that,
but no longer consider it wise to do things that way,
not when I am being careful.  It is better to handle
this duality by taking the associated relation to be
the &quot;fiber of truth&quot; in the function, (f^-1)(1) c X.

JA: We considered Aristotle's account of the sign relation:
    The first impression that we have of any pragma is the
    pathema that it strikes in our soul, and all the other
    signs and symbols that we form of this object are only
    so many chips off the imprinting of that initial block.

JC: Is this your personal response to reading Aristotle?
    If so, perhaps you might give the reader a clue what
    passages you are referring to.

Sorry, you must have been away when I introduced it:

JA: We glanced at the supreme silhouette of our entire subject
    that the prescient kindergartener C.S. Peirce prescissorly
    clipped out of spare materials found lying about the house
    and pasted into one of the most constructive papers of all
    those leaves that we see interleaved in his vast aftermath:

JA, quoting CSP:

    | We are now ready to assign logic its definition.
    | For this purpose, it must be granted that logic is
    |
    | a symbol
    |     whose essential end is
    |            to test
    |            (   truth,
    |            &lt;
    |            (   by reasons.
    |
    | CSP, CE 1, pages 328-329.
    |
    | Charles Sanders Peirce, &quot;Harvard Lectures 'On the Logic of Science'&quot;, (1865),
    |'Writings of Charles S. Peirce: A Chronological Edition, Volume 1, 1857-1866',
    | Peirce Edition Project, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN, 1982.

JC: The power of logic to construct lies is also enormous.
    The quoted view of logic ignores the role of human
    values in transmitting or communicating logic.

Not if you read &quot;symbol&quot; the way Peirce writes &quot;symbol&quot;.

JA: If we stick to a fragment of logic like ZOL(p, q), we would probably
    feel safe in saying that the purpose of this fragment is to describe
    as clearly as possible, perhaps for our own sakes alone, but perhaps
    for the sake of communicating or conveying to others, one particular
    mathematical object, namely, the lattice of 16 functions, {B^2 -&gt; B}.

JC: The intertwining of symbols of natural language with symbols 
    representing counting (correspondence with the natural numbers)
    make it difficult to find a way to claim that these are &quot;functions&quot;.
    When you identify the bijections, you may be able to communicate some
    of your beliefs about these symbols.

I don't get what you mean here.

JA: But we would like our grasp, our conception of any such object to be
    as abstract, categorical, generic, invariant, or universal as we can
    possibly make it, which is to say that we desire our notions of such
    objects to be formulated in such a fashion that they are not subject
    to the fading fad of fashion, but in such a way that renders them as
    independent of any particular language, medium, or representation as
    we can tailor them.

JC: If this is your objective, then you could start to distinguish 
    between logical symbols and non logical symbols so that partitions 
    and compositions are meaningful.

Yes, in my dissertation I had to use plain, singly, and doubly underlined
O's and 1's in order to make all the necessary distinctions, but my puns
here are hardly worse than the common abuses of notation that are widely
tolerated.  Maybe I will do it more carefully next time around.

JA: That is where the category-theoretic idea of a &quot;universal&quot; comes in.

JC: Mathematical category theory requires objects and morphisms and 
    structures that relate the objects to one another via morphisms.
    Is this one source of the universal that you seek?

I will be relating the notion of &quot;language independent terminology&quot; (LIT)
to the notion of a universal construction in the category-theoretic sense.

JC: I suggest that you go back and begin at the beginning and pay careful 
    attention to the roots of the words that are used to compose propositions.
    The references I provided will be of great value in such an exercise.  And,
    the jig-saw puzzle will become a coherent picture associating words and symbols
    with descriptions, meanings, and empirical relations.

The roots of what words?
