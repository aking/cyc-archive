Note 16

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

JA = Jon Awbrey
JF = Jim Farrugia

JA: So I will not forget that the most important thing about the data
    is how it refers to the objective world from which it is gathered,
    in the manner of signs that are abstractedly sampled from objects,
    by virtue of which sampling they denote the vaster reality beyond.

JF: You mention one important aspect of data.
    Why do you claim it's the most important?

JA: Let's just call it &quot;narrative interest&quot; or &quot;rhetorical emphasis&quot; for the moment.
    Feel free to mention some others, and then we can do the &quot;compare and contrast&quot;.

JF: OK.  Some others might be:

    * we can gather them up, store them somewhere, and find them again;

For what purpose?

    * it may be possible to combine them in interesting, useful, or pleasurable ways;
      and it may be useful to know what kinds of data we have, so we can determine
      the ways it might make sense to combine them.

For what purpose?

    * we may be able to compare one group of data to another;

For what purpose?

    * we may be able to compare one datum to another;

For what purpose?

    * we may be able to map the data to other things besides
      their referents (e.g., numerical values of heights and
      weight to a visual display);

For what purpose?

The Big Questions Are:

1.  Would you be doing any of this for its own sake?

2.  Would you be doing any of this if you were dead?

JF: What about things like how bits of data can or can't be combined
    (e.g., you can't (or perhaps can but shouldn't) add someone's age
    to someone else's height) ??

JA: Sorry, but that sort of thing happens all the time, I mean, on purpose.

JF: Yes, but does the fact it happens all the time on purpose make it less important?

Words like &quot;importance&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot; are just
references to what the Greeks called &quot;pragmata&quot;,
which it is our misfortune to get filtered by
way of the Latin &quot;object&quot; and &quot;objective&quot;, but
as soon as you refer to carrying out an action
with some aim, for some purpose, toward some
end, goal, object, objective -- then you are
referring to a 3-adic transaction, since the
action involves at minimum a change of state,
and, yes, the identity state transit counts,
and the intentional object makes three.

JA: Again, discounting the transient rhetorical factors,
    why do we have to choose?  This is precisely why I
    work within a sign-relational framework, so that
    I am free to consider the triple interactions
    within OxSxI.

JF: I don't think we do need to choose.  Can you explain
    to me (or point me to an explanation of) the triple
    interactions you speak of?

All motivated conduct involves 3-adic relations, what
I call &quot;conduct relations&quot;, or &quot;pragmatic relations&quot;,
of the sort that I mentioned above.  Their structure
is aptly comparable to that of 3-adic sign relations.

As a computational example, consider the requirement:

| Given an expression f, to find a simpler expression g, in such a way
| that both f and g are in the same &quot;semantic equivalence class&quot; (SEC)
| of a given &quot;semantic equivalence relation&quot; (SER), for instance, Q.

JA: A really important thing is the integral whole
    of the relevant sign relation L c OxSxI.

JF: What do you mean, &quot;the integral whole&quot;?

The whole sign relation L, as an object in its own right.
I frequently picture it as a 3-dim body in OxSxI-space.

JA: A really important aspect of that is how we transform
    signs into signs in regard to an object or objective.

JF: Can you elaborate (in just a few sentences?)?

The example of f =_Q g above.  More concretely,
we transform the sign &quot;2+2&quot; into the sign &quot;4&quot;,
with the aim of preserving a certain SER.

JA: Still, if you do think it through, i suspect you
    will find that the relation of concepts to a world
    we never made is the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of the rest.

JF: still thinking ...

(cogito (sum))
