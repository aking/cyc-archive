&gt; Your calculus is interesting, but I disagree with your approach,

John, please refer to Clause 2 of my "Genreic Disclaimer", below,
previously posted in the form of a Public Notice to the SUO List:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~NOTICE~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

GENREIC DISCLAIMER

1.  The writer writes under the presumption that the substance,
    if any, of what he writes is characterizable under either
    one of two cases:

    a.  Wholly derivative subsidiary to the works
        of one Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914).

    b.  Wrong.

2.  If the writer writes anything, the substance of which,
    if any, he presumes to originate with himself, he will
    be sure to make a special note of it, and to issue the
    appropriate notification.  Otherwise, the presumption
    may safely revert to that covered in Clause 1, above.

3.  If any other writer, or representative of a fictive
    entity, intelligent of otherwise, should presume to
    imagine that he, she, it sees in the writing of the
    present writer some reflection of his, her, its own
    original and proprietary thought, then the present
    writer suggests what is most likely the much safer
    presumption, in deed, he puts forth a claim as to
    what is most likely the much greater probability,
    that the other writer or representative exhibits
    thereby the lack of due diligence required to
    establish the truth of the matter, to wit,
    that the substance, if any, of what the
    other writer writes is characterizable
    under either one of two cases:

    a.  Wholly derivative subsidiary to the works
        of one Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914).

    b.  Wrong.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~ECITON~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

When we come to what I call the "Reflective Extension
of Logical Graphs" (RefLog), I shall be so bold as to
pretend an original contribution to the subject, but
even there, one that I vouchsafe was inspired by what
I essay to be thoroughly orthodox Peircean principles,
but I have not arrived at that point just yet, or not
this time around, anyway.

And, of course, to consign this little labor of love
to "the tradition of Frege-Russell-Spencer-Brown" is
just plain fight^n words where I come from ...

It is true that I ran into the works of CSP and GSB at about the same time,
early in the summer of my freshperson year, and I did spend almost the whole
next decade trying to get a grip on what they were saying, along with Frege
and Dodgson, as I was especially interested in anything logo-graphical, but
it is Peirce that persists, of course.

By the time I came to be writing my Senior Thesis (Field Study Substitute)
nine years later, I had spent almost two solid years working my plodding
way through the microfilm edition of the Peirce Manuscripts just trying
to surd out the soundness and the sense and the consequence of one tiny
paragraph in Peirce's work that had come to boggle my mind intensely,
to wit, CP 4.306.  Only an inessentially singular part of the problem
was the hatchet job that the editors of CP had done to the surrounding
essay, "The Simplest Mathematics" (CP 4.227-323, circa 1902), in order
to render it some semblance of a procrustean embedding in the galleys
of their chosen oarthography.

So when it come to your statement about this calculus, that:

&gt; it treats the rules of inference as primitives that are not
&gt; justified by their effects on truth conditions ...

I can only offer the following sorts of excuses and explanations:
First, I first ran across the phrase "truth conditions" in the
course of my readings in another tradition that shall remain
nameless for now, and so maybe it is tainted forever for me,
whether or not I one day come to discover, as is very likely,
that it nveretheless has a legitimate Peircean pedigree, but
if I were forced to make up a pragmatic interpretation for it
on the spot then I would probably say that it has something to
do with the reference of a propositional sign to its own object
and perhaps the manner and degree of its correspondence thereto.
Now, when it comes to the evaluation of a whole system of formal
rules, one is allowed to assay the suitability of whole systems
of signs to whole systems of objects and objectives, and that
is a pragmatic requirement that is never far from my mind.

Second, Peirce engaged in many different styles of formal play
when it came to his far-ranging contemplations and penetrating
musements about these species of formal systems, whether they
were inherited from others or invented by him.  One strategy
of formal exploration with which I became rather impressed
by my work on the problem mentioned above was his tactic
of using what we would now call "operator variables",
that is, of plugging in a set of nondescript symbols
for basic logical connectives and then looking for
forms of laws that are invariant over variations
along these dimensions.  Now, I was hampered in
my early work by the more uncertain dating of
the manuscripts that we had at that time --
and of course the strawberry proviso applies
rather pointedly here with respect to memories
that have lain in their cold storage for 30 years --
but I did get the impression that Peirce learned this
particular gambit rather early, being a natural tactic
in algebraic studies, and that it is what led him to the
discovery of the "amphecks" (from the Greek for "cutting
both ways"), that we call the Sheffer strokes Nand/Nnor.

&gt; &gt; When it comes down to this very primitive level of formal structure,
&gt; &gt; I find it important to note and I even tend to stress the formal
&gt; &gt; significance of the circumstance that this formal system is
&gt; &gt; a "very abstract calculus" (VAC), devoid of meaning in the
&gt; &gt; usual logical sense.  I cannot speak for how this works
&gt; &gt; out or what it might mean beyond this point, on the
&gt; &gt; next levels of form.

&gt; Peirce and Tarski followed the Aristotelian-Scholastic
&gt; tradition of treating logic as "the formal conditions for
&gt; the truth of representations", as CSP stated it.  As I pointed
&gt; out in my commentary on Peirce's MS 514, there is a continuous
&gt; line of descent from Aristotle to the medieval Scholastics to
&gt; Peirce and Tarski.  In that tradition, Frege and Russell stand
&gt; out as aberrations, which have mercifully been put to rest.
&gt; Spencer-Brown's approach is an unfortunate throwback to Frege.

Well, I do not read GSB that way.  To some extent he followed
in the footsteps of both Boole's and Peirce's more formal tacks,
again, just one of several tactics that each explored for a ways,
in which they explicitly detached themselves from the need to find
an immediate interpretation for each symbolic sign or transformation,
so long as the process made sense and acheived its object in the end.
Of course, we all prefer to travel in a meaning-continuous way, but
that can take time and many reworkings of a language to accomplish.

For me, the formal duality between the En and the Ex readings
is just something that's there, at least, at the alpha level --
and I have no idea yet whether there might be some profound
reason that the symmetry just has to break at the next level --
so it's like the duality that one has in projective geometry --
if your space is that shape then it's just the tool you need,
otherwise, you need to look for another.

&gt; For a brief review of the justification in terms of
&gt; truth conditions, click on the following URL and search
&gt; for the text beginning with the word "Ockham":
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb/net/~sowa/peirce/ms514.htm">http://www.bestweb/net/~sowa/peirce/ms514.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first theorem is known as the "Double Negation Theorem" (DNT).
&gt; &gt; The proof that succeeds it is derived from the one that was given
&gt; &gt; by George Spencer Brown in his book 'Laws of Form', and credited
&gt; &gt; to two of his students, John Dawes and D.A. Utting.  This result
&gt; &gt; is annotated as "Consequence 1" (C1) or as "Reflection" in LOF.
&gt; 
&gt; Ockham, Peirce, Tarski, and others proved it in terms of its
&gt; effects on truth conditions.  GSB, like Frege and Russell,
&gt; just played with meaningless symbols.

Look, I currently work almost exclusively in a (very simple-minded sort of)
model-theoretic vein, as that is what was eventually forced on me by the
overriding need for efficient computational implementations and the
constant need to make contact with empirical data, still, I get the
attractions and the uses of an elegant formalization whenever we
are lucky enough to fall over one.

&gt; There is nothing wrong with developing a formal calculus,
&gt; but to justify the rules of inference as anything more than
&gt; a meaningless game, you have show what effects they have on
&gt; truth conditions.

Well, there we agree, I think, as long as you read this phrase
about "truth conditions" as having something to do with pragmata.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
