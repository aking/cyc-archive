&gt;Pat,
&gt;  I don't think I understand your distinction.  We have used Cyc as 
&gt;an interlingua to translate between ontologies.

I honestly find that almost incredible, if it means what it seems to 
mean. Let me ask you for a little clarification. Did you use (1) the 
logical language of Cyc (Cycl), or (2) the concept heirarchy, or (3) 
the actual Cyc ontology (axioms and inference machinery and all)? You 
might be able to use the upper levels of the concept heirarchy as a 
kind of interlingua, if you werent being too careful with your 
ontological categories.

&gt; It is a particular ontology that consists of an upper ontology and 
&gt;"middle" and domain-specific ontologies.  I wouldn't claim that it's 
&gt;all things to all ontologists, but rather that it does provide a 
&gt;coherent formalization of most everything in the world you'd want to 
&gt;talk about (to some level of detail).

I would strongly disagree. (Well, "to some level of detail" allows so 
much latitude that it is kind of a tautology, but assuming that this 
means to some useful level of detail.) The Cyc ontology is full of 
gaps and oddities. Its spatial concepts, for example, are full of 
implicit assumptions (that objects are medium-sized, that gravity is 
salient, that spaces are understood at a geographical scale, for just 
a few) which do not apply outside a relatively narrow domain of 
application (roughly that of 'common sense' reasoning, as one would 
expect from Cyc's original motivation). It doesnt have a clear 
temporal ontology (it has shreds of various ones, all mutually 
incompatible.) If you want to talk about oil supply lines in the 
middle east, Cyc does it pretty well. If you want to talk about 
ideas, flavors, cooking, religion, chemistry, biology, physics, 
geology, weather, hydrodynamics, law, dynamics, or almost anything 
you care to name, it does a pretty poor job. Either you won't find 
the concepts you want in it, or (more seriously) you will find 
concepts which sound something like the concepts you want, but don't 
in fact fit your conceptual picture properly. This has been almost 
our universal experience in using Cyc for the RKF effort. We found 
many useful-seeming concepts, but on examining the axioms we had to 
reject about 70% of them immediately, and on examining the actual 
inferences that the system made we found that most of the concepts 
didnt in fact support the inferences one would have thought 
reasonable, so we had to reject most of them, and write our own 
ontology using a subset of them and other concepts which are 
incommensurate with them.

Don't get me wrong: I think that Cyc is in fact a wonderful piece of 
work. I don't think I could have done better. My point is not to 
trash Cyc, but to argue that any nontrivial ontology is going to make 
assumptions not made by others, so to talk of 'standard' is kind of 
misleading.

&gt;  If in the SUO we create another upper level ontology then there 
&gt;will be two ontologies suitable for acting as interlinguas.  Neither 
&gt;will be "right".

Indeed, and they will probably be incommensurate. But if any 
reasonably comprehensive ontology can be an interlingua, what is to 
be gained by calling one of them 'standard'?

&gt;Folks will fight over the differences, but groups would be able to 
&gt;decide to conform to either and be just fine.  Sure, there could be 
&gt;many standards if groups want to take the time to develop them.  I 
&gt;suspect however that if there is a standard which covers enough of 
&gt;the world to be useful, that practical people won't want to create 
&gt;their own when the IEEE SUO will work well enough.  If there is 
&gt;consensus on using the Cyc public upper ontology in this study 
&gt;group, then that's what we'll use and just augment it as people see 
&gt;fit.
&gt;  Some people will think this is not a useful effort, just as people 
&gt;have criticized Cyc for many years.  These concerns have been raised 
&gt;many times and I guess there isn't compelling evidence for either 
&gt;camp to change its view.  Ultimately, as Jim Schoening has pointed 
&gt;out, some folks will choose to be part of the SUO effort, and some 
&gt;won't.

Oh sure, fair enough. I just wanted to get the issues and claims 
clear. I get the impression that many of those involved with the SUO 
have a much more ambitious aim for it than you might have, however.
