&gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The "Pat Hayes Universal Change Of Variables Formula" (PHUCOVF)
&gt; &gt; has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula
&gt; &gt; that it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted
&gt; &gt; that nobody ever meant to say what some people once pretended
&gt; &gt; that it said, as have you also in regard to a co-indited point.
&gt; 
&gt; This paragraph at last persuades me that you have failed to grasp
&gt; the requirements of intellectual discourse.  You lack civility,
&gt; you lack respect for the time of others to whom you present
&gt; your ideas and you are wrapped up in your own abilities
&gt; without concern for those of others.
&gt; 
&gt; I recommend that you ponder long and hard and then decide
&gt; whether or not you are able to contribute in a mature and
&gt; reasonable manner to this forum.  I pray that your timing
&gt; has been unfortunate and the co-incidence with Graham Horn's
&gt; leaving today is pure accident;  otherwise, your reputation
&gt; has had a more dire effect than I could ever have imagined.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours most sincerely,
&gt;
&gt; Tim King.

Tim,

Thank you for that most sincere and most selective intervention.
Would that your equanimity had been equal to the task on every
equivalent occasion -- I can only presume that some thumb of
presumptuous authority rests heavy on the balance of your
ostensibly righteous judgment here -- but never mind,
better late than never, I always say.

But let me just remind you of how this all came about,
of what has come to be thrust on me, so much against
my own will, and of what is before and after all at
stake here, just so that you will have a chance to
understand why I take it as seriously as I do, and
despite all my most disarming attempts to maintain
a good, if a slightly rousing good humor.  Namely,
a review was made of a third party's work, a peer
review that in itself, at the time, appears not to
have been reviewed by any peers, and so it appears
that this third person's effort was savaged by what
I have come to regard, with many weeks of reflective
consideration -- though, in truth, the nub of it only
took the thought of a quiet hour once I had determined
to set my mind to it -- as an utterly savage ignorance.
That is just my opinion, of course, but it should tell
you the seriousness of the question, should what I say
prove true, and therefore why I think that it is the
duty of every responsible citizen in this civil body
of "Academic Industry" (AI) to seek the sooth of it.
Now, I do not know Bob? Burch, though I gather from
the one work of his that I have on my shelf that
perhaps he has not suffered too drastically from
what I regard as the unfair repute that has come
to be repeated again and against him in Our Forum,
so it may not be my place to take up the sword for
his sake, but when it comes to the person and the work
of one Charles Sanders Peirce, who has been uninvitedly
co-indited on an almost continual basis along with these
other charges that I regard as unjust as they are illiterate,
then that is a question that I cannot let slide, since so much
of my own life's work and my sacred honor depends on the truth
of these matters becoming more widely known and respected purely
for what is, before and after and above all, in the interest of all
parties, first or second or third or more, to know, to wit, the truth.

So I will persist.  If my persistence reveals me to be in the wrong,
then I will say so just when and if I become myself convicted of it.

And when it comes to grasping the bar that has been set on the
many-obstacled path of our "civil" and "intellectual" discourse --
I am afraid that my present age and bodymass do not permit me to
stoop so low as our coarsemasters have chosen to set it before me --
I can only suggest that before they go kicking dormitive dogs and
curs that are otherwise pre-occupied, they might first check to see
whether this old dog still has a tooth left in one of his three heads.

Just so I cannot be reckoned too self-indulgently guilty
of wasting the assembled thinkers' time with matters that
are purely personal, let me just try to redeem this note
and to make some good use of this occasion to reiterate
what the substance of my persistent reminders are, that
triadic relations are, in general, adamantly irreducible.

Yours most sincerely,

Jon Awbrey
