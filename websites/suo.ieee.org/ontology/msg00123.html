Dear Pat,

&gt; &gt;  If in the SUO we create another upper level ontology then there 
&gt; &gt;will be two ontologies suitable for acting as interlinguas.  Neither 
&gt; &gt;will be "right".
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, and they will probably be incommensurate. But if any 
&gt; reasonably comprehensive ontology can be an interlingua, what is to 
&gt; be gained by calling one of them 'standard'?

MW: I think Pat you have some misconceptions of what "standard" means as
used in "Standard Upper Ontology". You seem to be using it as confering some
special property on something, so that people would be obliged to use it.

Standard is a word (like all words) that have many meanings. The one I
believe is relevant in the context of the SUO is that a formal and open
methodology is/will be being used to develop the SUO as laid down by an
accredited standards body.

The other use of standard that I find useful is "something that most people
choose to use". The SUO can aspire to becoming this, but there is nothing
that predetermines this as an outcome. Standards that people "have" to use
are called laws.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Pat,
&gt; &gt;  I don't think I understand your distinction.  We have used Cyc as 
&gt; &gt;an interlingua to translate between ontologies.
&gt; 
&gt; I honestly find that almost incredible, if it means what it seems to 
&gt; mean. Let me ask you for a little clarification. Did you use (1) the 
&gt; logical language of Cyc (Cycl), or (2) the concept heirarchy, or (3) 
&gt; the actual Cyc ontology (axioms and inference machinery and all)? You 
&gt; might be able to use the upper levels of the concept heirarchy as a 
&gt; kind of interlingua, if you werent being too careful with your 
&gt; ontological categories.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is a particular ontology that consists of an upper ontology and 
&gt; &gt;"middle" and domain-specific ontologies.  I wouldn't claim that it's 
&gt; &gt;all things to all ontologists, but rather that it does provide a 
&gt; &gt;coherent formalization of most everything in the world you'd want to 
&gt; &gt;talk about (to some level of detail).
&gt; 
&gt; I would strongly disagree. (Well, "to some level of detail" allows so 
&gt; much latitude that it is kind of a tautology, but assuming that this 
&gt; means to some useful level of detail.) The Cyc ontology is full of 
&gt; gaps and oddities. Its spatial concepts, for example, are full of 
&gt; implicit assumptions (that objects are medium-sized, that gravity is 
&gt; salient, that spaces are understood at a geographical scale, for just 
&gt; a few) which do not apply outside a relatively narrow domain of 
&gt; application (roughly that of 'common sense' reasoning, as one would 
&gt; expect from Cyc's original motivation). It doesnt have a clear 
&gt; temporal ontology (it has shreds of various ones, all mutually 
&gt; incompatible.) If you want to talk about oil supply lines in the 
&gt; middle east, Cyc does it pretty well. If you want to talk about 
&gt; ideas, flavors, cooking, religion, chemistry, biology, physics, 
&gt; geology, weather, hydrodynamics, law, dynamics, or almost anything 
&gt; you care to name, it does a pretty poor job. Either you won't find 
&gt; the concepts you want in it, or (more seriously) you will find 
&gt; concepts which sound something like the concepts you want, but don't 
&gt; in fact fit your conceptual picture properly. This has been almost 
&gt; our universal experience in using Cyc for the RKF effort. We found 
&gt; many useful-seeming concepts, but on examining the axioms we had to 
&gt; reject about 70% of them immediately, and on examining the actual 
&gt; inferences that the system made we found that most of the concepts 
&gt; didnt in fact support the inferences one would have thought 
&gt; reasonable, so we had to reject most of them, and write our own 
&gt; ontology using a subset of them and other concepts which are 
&gt; incommensurate with them.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't get me wrong: I think that Cyc is in fact a wonderful piece of 
&gt; work. I don't think I could have done better. My point is not to 
&gt; trash Cyc, but to argue that any nontrivial ontology is going to make 
&gt; assumptions not made by others, so to talk of 'standard' is kind of 
&gt; misleading.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  If in the SUO we create another upper level ontology then there 
&gt; &gt;will be two ontologies suitable for acting as interlinguas.  Neither 
&gt; &gt;will be "right".
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, and they will probably be incommensurate. But if any 
&gt; reasonably comprehensive ontology can be an interlingua, what is to 
&gt; be gained by calling one of them 'standard'?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Folks will fight over the differences, but groups would be able to 
&gt; &gt;decide to conform to either and be just fine.  Sure, there could be 
&gt; &gt;many standards if groups want to take the time to develop them.  I 
&gt; &gt;suspect however that if there is a standard which covers enough of 
&gt; &gt;the world to be useful, that practical people won't want to create 
&gt; &gt;their own when the IEEE SUO will work well enough.  If there is 
&gt; &gt;consensus on using the Cyc public upper ontology in this study 
&gt; &gt;group, then that's what we'll use and just augment it as people see 
&gt; &gt;fit.
&gt; &gt;  Some people will think this is not a useful effort, just as people 
&gt; &gt;have criticized Cyc for many years.  These concerns have been raised 
&gt; &gt;many times and I guess there isn't compelling evidence for either 
&gt; &gt;camp to change its view.  Ultimately, as Jim Schoening has pointed 
&gt; &gt;out, some folks will choose to be part of the SUO effort, and some 
&gt; &gt;won't.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh sure, fair enough. I just wanted to get the issues and claims 
&gt; clear. I get the impression that many of those involved with the SUO 
&gt; have a much more ambitious aim for it than you might have, however.
