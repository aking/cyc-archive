| Formalism (Mathemetical) is a name which has been given to any one
| of various accounts of the foundations of mathematics which emphasize
| the formal aspects of mathematics as against content or meaning, or which,
| in whole or in part, deny content to mathematical formulas.  The name is often
| applied, in particular, to the doctrines of Hilbert, although Hilbert himself
| calls his method axiomatic, and gives to his syntactical or metamathematical
| investigations the name Beweistheorie ('proof theory', q.v.).

Jon Awbrey wrote (JA):

JA: And this should not have been such a big surprise.
    It is not humanely possible for healthy human beings to
    devote their lives to an activity that they themselves
    consider meaningless.  I work with formal systems that
    I conform to custom in calling &quot;uninterpreted&quot;, but the
    reason why these systems of forms are privileged, indeed,
    so highly prized, is that they have so many splendored
    and sundry interpretations, not because they have none.
    I do not know how to convey this -- it is a fact of life
    discovered, not a thing to be proved from any axioms --
    I could write a story or a novel maybe, but Hesse already
    wrote it, with far more skill than I could muster, and still
    so few get it.  I could try to relate my personal philosophy
    of mythematics, but I have done that before and have seen
    people think I am joking, and even before Howard explained
    to me the nature of a joke I could have told you that it
    does no good to explain why the joke is no joke.  So I
    must leave it at that ...

JC: If this is your notion of uninterpreted, I can see why you might have had trouble.
    I see uninterpreted as abstracting from specific interpretation, but not lacking
    an interpretation in the abstract.  I see the alternative you propose as nonsense.

JA: Of course it's nonsense -- that's what I have been been saying the whole time.
    But I am not the one who has been proposing it.  If you have never heard a hint
    before of the phrases &quot;meaningless formal calculus&quot; and &quot;just follow the rules&quot;,
    then I am sorry that I ever troubled you.

JC: My point is that these are always abstractions from more concrete cases, and
    always occur in context.  &quot;Just follow the rules&quot; is not possible in general
    unless the rules are embedded within some system whose context specifies what
    the rules are.  A &quot;meaningless formal calculus&quot; is possible, but that is not
    propositional logic or any other formal system with which I have worked.
    I only work with formal systems that have a semantics.  It seems to me
    rather pointless, to say the least, to engage in meaningless formal
    calculus.  I sincerely doubt that anyone has proposed either as
    useful in anyway, but I am willing to look at examples.

Vide Supra.

JC: I must admit, that I often felt that some of my professors at UCLA
    were engaged in one or the other or both practices, but that is
    really not very fair to them, and was more my own frustration
    with their interests, and their lack of concern with what
    cannot be formalized than anything else.

JC: One would get bored at having to deal with nonsense for very long.
    My understanding of this distinction comes from reading Russell on
    proper names and on incomplete symbols, as well as Kaplan and Perry
    on demonstratives and identification.

JA: Beauty is Form, and Form Beauty,
    And that's all you need to know.
    There's more to follow for sure,
    Quasi modo gratuitous corollary.
    In life as in mathematics, only
    Beauty can render it worthwhile.

JA: Still, by posing things in all-or-none terms,
    saying &quot;X cannot be formalized&quot; when we need
    to say &quot;X cannot be exhaustively formalized&quot;,
    we characteristically miss the whole point
    of the exercise, partially to formalize X,
    and deny ourselves the practical benefits
    of doing just that.  I see a certain type
    of psychodynamic here that needs to be
    interpreted in a therapeutic remedium.

JC: Granted, but there is a tendency to resort to technique
    when it is available to the ignorance of everything else.

JA: In math as in art, the name of that is poor technique.

JC: I don't think so.  It is poor practice, but can yield excellent technical work.

JA: De gustibus, and so on, ...

JC: Yeh, that's what I meant above about my revision
    of my evaluation of what some of my professors
    were doing.

JC: This has led many contemporary philosophers of logic,
    some of them friends of mine, to argue that truth and
    validity are restricted to what we can constructively
    define through one or another specific technique.  I
    believe that, much as formalization is useful, it must
    systematically push out issues of truth and validity
    for any logic as strong as 1st order.

JA: The name of that is poor formalization.

JC: No, unless all formalization is poor formalization.
    See my paper on the dynamics of information and the
    origins of semiosis for my reasons.

JA: I think that we just attach different meanings to the word &quot;formalization&quot;.

JC: I mean by formalization the abstraction from concrete cases to their
    relational structure (where structure is understood in the mathematical
    sense that fully determines a set of models, realizations, or instantiations).
    What do you mean?

Reflection on conduct that produces an explicit description or a partial expression
of an aspect of its form that had until that time only implicitly been informing it.

JC: Truth functional logic and modal logic, on the other hand, are complete.
    As I have said before on this list, that is one of the reasons I favour
    an information based logic.  It gives us both sides of the coin within
    the logic itself, as Greg Chaitin argues admirably, in my opinion,
    but not in the opinion of many logicians who do not see intuitively
    how distinctions are relevant to logic.  I do think that they need
    therapy, and Wittgenstein is as good as Peirce for this, I think.

JA: Logical systems can be &quot;complete&quot; in their own terms,
    but sign systems are never complete when you wake up
    and recall their due function in describing a world,

JC: I don't believe the first phrase makes sense in contrast
    to the second (see my remarks on &quot;uninterpreted&quot; above).

JA: The word &quot;complete&quot; is ambiguous here, if not a complete cipher.
    I cannot say yet whether the ambiguity can be made systematic.

JC: Sorry, I don't get this.

JC: Funny, I would take it that once we have done the latter,
    it follows that the complete formal systems are complete.
    I wouldn't say that they are complete in their own terms,
    because I couldn't even venture to say what that meant.

JA: I informally use phrases like &quot;complete relative to itself&quot; to mean that
    all expressions with universal model sets in some universe are provable.
    Propositional calculus is like that, and this means that one can check
    its theorems quasi modo model theory over a suitably chosen universe.

JC: More than that, Prop Calc applies to all possible universes,
    so one does not have to check it in particular universes.

JA: I have no practical and usable conception of &quot;all possible universes&quot; --
    I have always had to take my universes one or two or three at a time.
    I am talking about the measures of computational work that it takes
    in real terms to check whether a given proposition is a tautology.
    From my practical experience in writing theorem checking, proving,
    and applied logic programs, I have learned that model-theoretic
    methods are very often more efficient, useful, and all-round
    much more informative for the types of problems that arise
    in real applications.  I am engaged in applied logic here,
    not just decorating the study with tautologies, but using
    propositions to describe situations of interest and then
    computing derived facts about these situations.  Now, it
    does makes a lot of practical sense to factor out a core
    of pure logic at the heart of this applied enterprise,
    but unless it helps to keep the engine running it is
    not really that interesting for the sake of a' that.

JC: Well, the antecedent of my statement above is a consequence of definition,
    or at least it is usually taken that X is possible iff it has a consistent
    model, and Prop Calc determines consistency, if anything does (a non-trivial
    condition, given the non-formalizability of the truth concept, except relatively
    to a language in some meta-language).  Validity is also only relatively formalizable.
    In both cases we know that there is no definable limit of embedded meta-languages that
    converges on the desired absolute concept.  I realize that this is contrary to Peirce's
    convergent realism, but with all due respect to Peirce, he did not understand these issues.

Peirce understood his aim well enough to know that inquiry is not an arrow
that can be nocked by a purely deductive enbowing, which is better than the
Flatlander Tourists In Babel have ever understood about the Logic Of Science.

JC: This is why I maintained before that Goedel's results are of
    much more  significance than you were willing to grant them.
    Forgive me, but I really don't see how the more specific cases
    in applied logic can alter this more general result in any way.

I am talking about how to conserve the environment while spraying for mosquitoes.
You are suggesting how the right sort of syntactical nuclear device oughta do it.

JC: Now, Goedel saw the way out as a sort of transcendental idealism, as did Kant.
    In neither case do I see that it leads to the resolution of issues in science
    or the philosophy of science, though Goedel thought that his closed temporal
    loops showed the ideality of time.  Not many have agreed with him.  Now Peirce's
    style of completeness at the ideal limit seems to me to make sense only within
    this sort of framework, but, as I said, personally I can't see any way to give
    it an interpretation that I can make meaningful (by which I mean, which I can
    use in any way that makes a difference to my understanding, let alone to my
    experience).

This is all beside the point, my point anyway, in several directions at once:

1.  The working philosophy of all mathematicians is platonic realism,
    not any kind of trance-idealism.  Numbers exist.  Things follow.
    It is all so taken for granted that they do not even bother to
    discuss it, and this led some dis-contented civilians to think
    that they could speak for them, but what got said was so silly
    that it stirred Gödel to speak up and shoot it down.  You can
    call it a therapeutic advance to turn a virus against itself,
    but nobody had that particular bug before those Principians
    infected the population with it.  It's a little like certain
    software manufactors we know who want to bill you for fixes
    to bugs you never had until you unwarily bought their wares.
    The misconceit of mathematics that got itself embodied in
    'Principia Mathematica' is not the sort of mistake that
    an earlier, realist generation would ever have made in
    the first place, having never even thought to arrogate
    to themselves such an overweaning over-extension of a
    lame idea as to to think that the entire foundation
    of mathematics could ever be finitely axiomatized.

2.  You seem to be blithely oblivious to the way that pragmatic factors
    affect what we can actually do with logical languages in practical
    computing terms.  The question is not &quot;how the more specific cases
    in applied logic can alter this more general result in any way&quot;.
    The question is how this more general result might bear on the
    practical details of what we need to do in specific cases of
    applied logic, while the circumstance is that the high-flown
    principle does not reach the ground on which help is needed.
    Theorem-cranking is a purely incidental part of the task --
    contingent propositions come into far greater prominence
    when the expressions of the language are actually being
    used as descriptions of pragmatic objects or situations.
    And here you want to be able to generate models to spec.
    This really takes a whole different order of technique
    than the sort of gamey methods found in be-wise-theory.
