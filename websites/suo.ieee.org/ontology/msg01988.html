Dear Jon, 

Maybe we ought to move this to the Peirce-L or elsewhere so as not to
interfere with the purpose of this list once it gets geared back up.  But
in the meantime (with thanks to the indulgent list members):

 (1) logic is partly an attempt to clarify the
     nature (semantics and syntax) of propositions,
 
&gt; Jim, I view logic as a normative science.  This view has the 
&gt; following
&gt; array of logical implications and practical consequences.  As a 
&gt; science,
&gt; logic is a form of inquiry that seeks to end, like any form of 
&gt; inquiry,
&gt; a particular variety of uncertainty.  In the case of logic the 
&gt; specific
&gt; type of uncertainty in question is one as to how we ought to conduct 
&gt; our
&gt; reasoning in order to achieve the aim, end, goal, object, or 
&gt; "pragma" of
&gt; reasoning in general.  The normative quality of this science comes 
&gt; in with
&gt; the word "ought", but this is an "ought" that is related to a 
&gt; predesignated
&gt; object, and this, as you know, tends to bring down on the heads of 
&gt; pragmatic
&gt; thinkers the charge of crass utilitarianism, if not the moral 
&gt; equivalent of
&gt; warlocks.  As a science whose celebrants feel fortunate enough to 
&gt; claim that
&gt; it has met with the occasional if provisional success, logic claims 
&gt; to have
&gt; arrived, here and there, now and again, at genuine bits of knowledge 
&gt; as to
&gt; how we ought to conduct our thinking if we want to succeed at it.  
&gt; As you
&gt; know, this view is often discovered to be controversial, even among 
&gt; those
&gt; who call themselves "pragmatic thinkers".

Jon,  I would agree that logic is normative to the extent that to reason
otherwise is not effective.  But mostly, in my view, because logic
desribes the way one must reason to accord with the way the world
actually is.  But I appreciate your pointing this out as frankly for a
moment there (while putting this together) I could not even think of what
logic was generally considered to be (i.e. correct or effective
reasoning).  I mean I got so narrowly focused on the notion I was trying
to explore. I think that sometimes the questions of beginners, such as
myself, are the most challenging.  So I appreciate your time and
patience. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (2) our proposition and thus our logic reflect our basic 
&gt; assumptions
&gt; &gt;     about the nature of that supposed reality which we are 
&gt; representing
&gt; &gt;     by our propositions,
&gt; 
&gt; One of the functions of language is to describe the phenomena of 
&gt; experience,
&gt; and all of the descriptive sciences depend on its success in this 
&gt; function.
&gt; Language has a logical aspect, constituted by the logical forms that 
&gt; are
&gt; embodied in it, and so it may seem that these logical forms have a 
&gt; role
&gt; in the description of reality.  I guess it depends on what a role is.
&gt; But it is also true that the normative function of logic is rather
&gt; independent, not "exclusiove of all relationship to", but just
&gt; independent, of its descriptive role.

My hunch is that description is primary and that the normative function
of logic derives its power from the fact that accurate description of
what "is" provides what "works".   It's fated.  


&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (3) for the most part we assume that reality to be one
&gt; &gt;     in which things (variables) are moving about in space-time,
&gt; 
&gt; As I scan ahead, I find that the rest of your discussion hinges
&gt; rather heavily on this identification of "things" with "variables",
&gt; a thing that I do not understand, and I am torn as to how to proceed,
&gt; whether to attach your remaining predications to the subject of 
&gt; things
&gt; or to the subject of variables, or whether to try and explain, 
&gt; instead,
&gt; how I understand the use of "variables", which appears to be the more
&gt; problematic concept of the pair.  I think that I will wait and see
&gt; how you receive what I have written above and maybe try to tackle
&gt; the rest of it the next time.

Ah,  I'm probably misusing both terms.  How about if I just replace all
my problematic talk of variables with the word "things"?  In fact I just
went ahead and did that below.   So,  Jon,  I'm greatly enjoying your
comments and hope you will press on with your point by point criticism. 
I'm eager to find out if you think (despite your charitable instincts)
that some position I'm taking just won't hold water.  And if so where
I've gone astray and how I might find my way back.  I've already got some
hints above but I'm hoping if I patch up these leaky variables maybe I'll
still have something to drink at the end of the day.   I realize you are
engaged in some careful and strenuous thinking on these matters, but you
need not take that sort of care in addressing my comments.  My remarks
are those of an interested beginner.  I'm just nervy enough to ask a
serious student of the subject (and generous friend) to take a quick
peek.  

Damn!  Maryland had em!  Duke's great and all that, but what's the fun if
you can't root for the underdog. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (4) we call the movement of things events,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (5) we call the impact or consequence of one event upon another 
&gt; event or
&gt; &gt;     thing the 'meaning" of that event with respect to the other 
&gt; thing,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (6) by "impact" or consequence we mean the ways in which the future
&gt; &gt;     developmental possibilities of the impacted event or thing
&gt; &gt;     are limited.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So to recap a main point  -- we basically assume reality to be 
&gt; comprised of
&gt; &gt; things moving about in space time.  Syntax defines the 
&gt; permissible types
&gt; &gt; of moves (given our notion of what constitutes a thing) and 
&gt; semantics refers
&gt; &gt; to the consequences of these moves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I hope all this was not too muddled.
&gt; &gt; I present it both as a set up for
&gt; &gt; the following but also for review
&gt; &gt; on it's own merit.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My point-question is this:  Are not rules of inference in effect 
&gt; definitions
&gt; &gt; of things.  IOWs a thing is that construct whose meaning is 
&gt; preserved
&gt; &gt; when subjected to the following  ROIs or transformations.  So in a 
&gt; sense
&gt; &gt; (I'm suggesting-asking) do not ROIs also address the meaning of one
&gt; &gt; component of our presumed reality -- namely the nature of 
&gt; things?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And might not a logic (Russell's for example) run into difficulty 
&gt; when
&gt; &gt; it turns out that the presumed nature of a thing (class or 
&gt; whatever)
&gt; &gt; turns out to be contradictory under certain ROIs.  Maybe self 
&gt; contradictory
&gt; &gt; things DO exist -- just not on the macro level we are 
&gt; accustomed to working
&gt; &gt; with.  Hopefully I have not completely lost my way or simply 
&gt; started off on the
&gt; &gt; wrong foot to begin with.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any comments-suggestions you
&gt; &gt; have the time or inclination to offer.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Jim Piat
