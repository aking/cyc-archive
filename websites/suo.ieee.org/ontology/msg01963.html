&gt; &gt; First, the model theory which Chris invented for KIF has,
&gt; &gt; almost as a side-effect, the possibility of distinguishing
&gt; &gt; between relations (the individual things which relation symbols
&gt; &gt; denote) and relational extensions.  To emphasise:  it does not
&gt; &gt; *require* that these be distiguished, but it does allow for this
&gt; &gt; as a possibility.  Since this is therefore built into the language,
&gt; &gt; as it were, we do have Leibnitz' option available to us.  However,
&gt; &gt; the identification of 'class' with 'set' is slightly more debateable.
&gt; &gt; I think we are all agreed that classes are sets, ...
&gt;
&gt;This is just the opposite of what I am used to.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; but to assert the identity of the two ideas would
&gt; &gt; seem to imply that all sets are classes, ...
&gt;
&gt;"All sets are classes" is exactly what
&gt;most "logic and maths people" (LAMP's)
&gt;whom I have ever known would say.

Sorry, we are getting our communication wires crossed by a pun on 
"class". Mathematicians use the word in a very particular way, which 
in its full form is written "proper class", to refer to things that 
anyone but a mathematican (and even some of them) would call a set, 
except they are so big that if they are accepted into the 
set-theoretic universe they would give rise to paradoxes. In the 
wider word, however, the term "class" is used in a sense which is 
closely linked to "classification", to refer to (the extension of) a 
named category in some kind of classification heirarchy. Such classes 
all have sets as their extension (or, maybe, ARE sets), but not every 
set would normally be dignified with the title of 'class(ification)'

&gt; &gt; and this usage would conflict with most usages of 'class' in
&gt; &gt; modern ontological usage.  (Another related word is 'sort').
&gt;
&gt;I suspect there is no real hope of having this peculiar usage
&gt;extend to the broader technical community.

Im afraid that this sense of 'class' has already been in widespread 
use throughout at least one of the broader technical ontology 
communities for about a decade now. Check out the literature on 
description logics and such ontological 'standards' as LOOM and 
CLASSIC.

&gt; &gt; So what we have agreed to do is to institutionalize a kind
&gt; &gt; of official agnosticism.  There are three ways of talking:
&gt; &gt; in terms of classes and instances;  properties and individuals;
&gt; &gt; or about sorts and individuals.  These ways of talking are
&gt; &gt; intertranslateable.  Classes, sorts and properties are all
&gt; &gt; similar in that they all have associated extensions which
&gt; &gt; are 'pure' sets; ...
&gt;
&gt;I will assume here that "pure sets" are what non-modern non-ontologists
&gt;call "classes", and try to read on with that in mind.  Let me know ...

Not proper classes. Put aside the mathematical usage of "set/class" 
terminology for now. I was using the admittedly odd term "'pure' set" 
(perhaps "set simpliciter" would have been better) just to mean 
'set'; it seemed to require some terminological decoration since many 
folk identify "set" with "class" in any case. Your term "LAMP set" 
will do fine.

&gt; &gt; and many of the things that are said about them are rendered
&gt; &gt; true or false by criteria which depend only on their extensions.
&gt;
&gt;That would put them in a class with sets and classes,
&gt;whose names will always suggest a bearing of extension,
&gt;however succesfully or not this bearing is borne out.

Yes, I agree. All of these notions have a bearing of extension, in 
your elegant phrase.

&gt; &gt; However, whether or not they ARE their extensions
&gt; &gt; cannot, strictly, even be posed as a question, ...
&gt;
&gt;These are still the "pure sets" (what LAMP's call "classes")?
&gt;They begin to sound much less pure and more like intensions.

No, I try to use the word "set" only in its pure mathematical sense. 
Being a LAMP, sets are something I understand. The rest is somewhat 
murky. I will use "set" only in the LAMP sense, or still more sharply 
in the FOMP sense. (However, to emphasise, I am *not* using "class" 
in the LAMP or FOMP sense.)

&gt;It seems like it would be a good idea, if you wish explicitly
&gt;to set aside or to defer the bearing of any extension, to give
&gt;them a name that advises the reader of that, say, "intensions".

Had I so wished, I would indeed have tried to be careful in the way 
you suggest.

&gt; &gt; and the truthvalues of any KIF expression will be unchanged
&gt; &gt; if we insist that they always are, or if we insist that they
&gt; &gt; never are, or if we take some intermediate position.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Someone whose philosophical tastes run in one or the other direction
&gt; &gt; is free to impose their tastes on the semantic theory, and then the
&gt; &gt; logic will 'work' within those tastes perfectly well.  For example,
&gt; &gt; if someone wanted to say that properties are not identical to their
&gt; &gt; extension, but that classes are, ...
&gt;
&gt;I have trouble understanding this.  I am used to saying
&gt;that a set (a LAMP set) is "determined by" its extension,
&gt;but never that a set is "identical to" its extension.

For the first time in this message you leave me confused. In what way 
does a set (a LAMP set) differ from its extension? Certainly any set 
described by ZF set theory is identical to its extension. The 
extension of a set S is the set of members of S, and that must be S 
by the axiom of extensionality.

&gt; &gt; could indeed say that without fear of contradiction;
&gt; &gt; they would be obliged, of course, to understand the
&gt; &gt; translation of class-language into property-language
&gt; &gt; as one which translates extensions into intensions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To extensionalists such as myself and Matthew, all of these are sets:
&gt; &gt; some sets are called classes, some classes are called properties, and
&gt; &gt; some properties are called sorts, but they are all just sets.  But it
&gt; &gt; seems that this kind of robust non-nonsense extensionalism is not in
&gt; &gt; the forefront of fashion.
&gt;
&gt;I have never even heard of it until now.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Since these issues of philosphical stance and terminology are among
&gt; &gt; the most contentious and also the ones that make the least difference
&gt; &gt; to anyone other than philosophers, the fact that KIF is in effect
&gt; &gt; provably neutral on them has several advantages.  In particular,
&gt; &gt; it allows people to cooperate, and it puts the fact that these
&gt; &gt; quarrels are really about nothing of any practical importance
&gt; &gt; into sharp relief.
&gt;
&gt;I am beginning to suspect that some Malcontented Cartesian Demon
&gt;has transposed all of the appearances of "set" and "class" in
&gt;your text before sending it on to me.  Let me know, that is,
&gt;if you can find a secure channel of communication.

Do not read "class" as meaning "proper class" in the mathematical 
sense, but rather as "classification". I don't have an exact 
definition of a "class" in this sense, and I doubt if there is one; 
nevertheless the term is in widespread usage. It seems to correspond 
roughly to "natural kind", which also has no usabel definition. 
Examples of classes might be: Human, Animal, Abstract,... but sets 
such as the one that contains even integers, the Eiffel tower and my 
aunties would not normally be called "classes".
