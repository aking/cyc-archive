Jim,

Sorry, we apparenly had messages crossing in the emails.
Interlinear remarks below.

&gt; Jon and Graham,
&gt; 
&gt; First, let's resolve this off-line.
&gt; 
&gt; Graham, Jon is no longer subscribed to or posting to the SUO list,
&gt; so that issue is no longer an issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon, Sometimes people do want to know what list you've posted something to,
&gt; so when you change its name in your address book, this confuses people.  In fact,
&gt; the reason I asked you to watch your quantity of postings to SUO is that I couldn't
&gt; tell that the postings were going to Ontology (if I remember correctly).  So, it's best
&gt; to keep the addresses unchanged.

As far as I know, the addressbook ID, e.g. Graham's &quot;Ontology Standard Upper (E-mail)&quot;
as opposed to the authorized email address, e.g., &quot;&lt;standard-upper-ontology@ieee.org&gt;&quot;,
is a purely local specification, and I was unaware that there was any official string
that was authorized or even specified.

Since my browser/reader shows me both the Address Name (addressbook ID)
and the Actual Address, I was also unaware of any potential for confusion,
and I do not think that I even notice the rather large variety of ID's
that different people use unless somebody calls my attention to it.

At first I thought that Graham's wallfire might be stripping
the real email addresses out of his textsdream, but I notice
that he seems to be perfectly aware of the actual address:

GH: I also see &quot;Stand! Unfold! Ontology!&quot; has &quot;ontology@ieee.org&quot; as its e-mail address.

Thus I suspect that the actual, real, causative problem lies elsewhere
than appears to be indicated from the remarks he chooses to address it.

There is certainly nothing very &quot;standard&quot; about Graham' personal
choice of &quot;Ontology Standard Upper (E-mail)&quot;.  Perhaps the main
working group can now set to work on standardizing the name of
the main working group's addressbook ID.  All the best wishes.

Jon Awbrey

&gt; Jon, 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but what about the other SUO lists. 
&gt; 
&gt; I, and I believe some others, had to subscribe 
&gt; to ALL the SUO lists, because of the 
&gt; unreliability of the method of list selection. 
&gt; 
&gt; Just looking at the latest post of a thread my 
&gt; e-mail system lists as having 31 items since 
&gt; 25 Jul '01- all from you, I see it gives 
&gt; &quot;Stand! Unfold! Ontology!&quot; is a cc addressee. 
&gt; I also see &quot;Stand! Unfold! Ontology!&quot; has 
&gt; &quot;ontology@ieee.org &quot; as its e-mail address. 
&gt; 
&gt; In any event, why shouldn't you want to be 
&gt; considerate to subscribers to the other SUO 
&gt; lists such as &quot;Stand! Unfold! Ontology!&quot;?

&gt; &gt; In view of your response below to my
&gt; &gt; request, it needs to be said you are still
&gt; &gt; one of the more prolific posters of input
&gt; &gt; to the SUO list. In fact, I would venture
&gt; &gt; to say that you are possibly still the
&gt; &gt; most prolific poster of input to it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Furthermore, many of your contributions
&gt; &gt; are responses to other contributions.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Jim,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; With respect to the Main SUO Work I am but a &quot;mildly intersted onlooker&quot;
&gt; &gt; at this point.  I have unsubscribed from the main list and removed its
&gt; &gt; address from my address book, so unless I inadvertently hit &lt;reply-all&gt;
&gt; &gt; you should not have gotten any e-mail from me on that line since the
&gt; &gt; message of Mon, 09 Jul 2001 19:40:38 -0400 on &quot;Quantity of Postings&quot;
&gt; &gt; that I have attached for your reference.  The message that you reply
&gt; &gt; to here was sent to the &quot;ONT&quot; Sublist, as you have often requested.
&gt; &gt; The Archives have been down all week so I have no way of knowing
&gt; &gt; if the Archiver is cross-listing stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All The Best Wishes,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Please take this as a friendly request.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your volume of postings is again back to a very high level.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please be careful to post only those messages that contribute
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the scope of this project.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have not been reading your recent threat [thread?] on inquiry.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously it relates to ontology and probably even to an upper ontology,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but then everything under the sun does.  Is there a direct connection
&gt; &gt; &gt; that would justify this discussion on the SUO list.  If not, could
&gt; &gt; &gt; you move it to the Ontology list?

&gt; &gt; &gt; By way of giving this question a proper form of inaugural,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought that I would share with you some of my favorite
&gt; &gt; &gt; quotations on the subject of inquiry, each one reflecting
&gt; &gt; &gt; a different facet of this resplendently fascinating topic.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; With regard to the bearing of the more poetic expressions,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will leave you now to your own contemplations, and, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the moment and the immediate future, I will focus on what
&gt; &gt; &gt; is evidently the most prosaic and derivative of the bunch,
&gt; &gt; &gt; where I think it sufficient to echo Peirce's echo of Kant.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that this statement forms a cardinal expression --
&gt; &gt; &gt; embodying the heart and serving as the hinge -- for a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; important principle, one that goes a large part of the way
&gt; &gt; &gt; toward explaining how the information that is stored up in
&gt; &gt; &gt; an ontology, a &quot;body of ontological knowledge&quot; (BOOK), can
&gt; &gt; &gt; work to inform the progress of inquiries on which it bears.

&gt; &gt; Jim,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know that it will surprise some people if I say it,
&gt; &gt; but other than the sort of chatter that it takes just
&gt; &gt; to have any kind of community feeling at all, that is
&gt; &gt; all that I have been trying to do since the very start.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think that it would be good if we had some systematic way of
&gt; &gt; analyzing our stated goals in relation to the resources that we
&gt; &gt; already have in our command, the capacities that we need to build,
&gt; &gt; the obstacles that we need to overcome, and the problems that we
&gt; &gt; need to solve -- just the way that most programmer types would
&gt; &gt; go about tackling any goal-hacking task -- but I do not see
&gt; &gt; that happening here, so why fight it?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I understand that different people have different ideas about what will

&gt; &gt; an effective task-analytic method for the job, I think that it will just
&gt; &gt; go on with a process of seeing who can shout who down.  What I do not
&gt; &gt; understand is why somebody who believes that he or she has something
&gt; &gt; positive and constructive to contribute to his or her vision of what
&gt; &gt; a SUO should be would even waste the time that it takes to write yet
&gt; &gt; another one of those messages that say in effect &quot;I will not bring
&gt; &gt; my Imperial Circus to your town unless you clear the Arena first!&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My guess is that there is a problematic dynamic affecting this community that
&gt; &gt; will not be solved by the stifling of one poet or the scaping of one goat, but
&gt; &gt; my guess is also that you will all insist on discovering that for yourself, and
&gt; &gt; I am tired of trying to second guess the perceptions of relevance that may or may
&gt; &gt; not be in somebody else's head, so I believe that the best solution for me and for
&gt; &gt; everybody else is just for me retire completely to the Ontology sublist henceforth.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am posting this to the whole group so that I won't be able to go back on it.

&gt; &gt; I would appreciate it if you would retain
&gt; &gt; at least recognisable portions of the titles
&gt; &gt; of e-mails to which you are replying.

&gt; &gt; Jim,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; With respect to the Main SUO Work I am but a &quot;mildly intersted onlooker&quot;
&gt; &gt; at this point.  I have unsubscribed from the main list and removed its
&gt; &gt; address from my address book, so unless I inadvertently hit &lt;reply-all&gt;
&gt; &gt; you should not have gotten any e-mail from me on that line since the
&gt; &gt; message of Mon, 09 Jul 2001 19:40:38 -0400 on &quot;Quantity of Postings&quot;
&gt; &gt; that I have attached for your reference.  The message that you reply
&gt; &gt; to here was sent to the &quot;ONT&quot; Sublist, as you have often requested.
&gt; &gt; The Archives have been down all week so I have no way of knowing
&gt; &gt; if the Archiver is cross-listing stuff.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; All The Best Wishes,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Please take this as a friendly request.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your volume of postings is again back to a very high level.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have not been reading your recent threat [thread?] on inquiry.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously it relates to ontology and probably even to an upper ontology,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but then everything under the sun does.  Is there a direct connection
&gt; &gt; &gt; that would justify this discussion on the SUO list.  If not, could

&gt; &gt; &gt; | question of whether it were possible for one mind to cause

&gt; &gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; &gt; |            Do not block the way of inquiry.
&gt; &gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; &gt; | Although it is better to be methodical in our investigations,

&gt; &gt; &gt; | and undiscouraged.  On the other hand, to set up a philosophy
&gt; &gt; &gt; | which barricades the road of further advance toward the truth
&gt; &gt; &gt; | is the one unpardonable offence in reasoning, as it is also

&gt; &gt; &gt; | Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; | an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate
&gt; &gt; &gt; | in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert
&gt; &gt; &gt; | the elements of the original situation into a unified whole.

&gt; &gt; &gt; By way of giving this question a proper form of inaugural,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought that I would share with you some of my favorite
&gt; &gt; &gt; quotations on the subject of inquiry, each one reflecting
&gt; &gt; &gt; a different facet of this resplendently fascinating topic.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; With regard to the bearing of the more poetic expressions,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will leave you now to your own contemplations, and, for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the moment and the immediate future, I will focus on what
&gt; &gt; &gt; is evidently the most prosaic and derivative of the bunch,
&gt; &gt; &gt; where I think it sufficient to echo Peirce's echo of Kant.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that this statement forms a cardinal expression --
&gt; &gt; &gt; embodying the heart and serving as the hinge -- for a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; important principle, one that goes a large part of the way
&gt; &gt; &gt; toward explaining how the information that is stored up in
&gt; &gt; &gt; an ontology, a &quot;body of ontological knowledge&quot; (BOOK), can
&gt; &gt; &gt; work to inform the progress of inquiries on which it bears.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know that it will surprise some people if I say it,
&gt; &gt; but other than the sort of chatter that it takes just
&gt; &gt; to have any kind of community feeling at all, that is
&gt; &gt; all that I have been trying to do since the very start.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think that it would be good if we had some systematic way of
&gt; &gt; analyzing our stated goals in relation to the resources that we
&gt; &gt; already have in our command, the capacities that we need to build,
&gt; &gt; the obstacles that we need to overcome, and the problems that we
&gt; &gt; need to solve -- just the way that most programmer types would
&gt; &gt; go about tackling any goal-hacking task -- but I do not see
&gt; &gt; that happening here, so why fight it?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I understand that different people have different ideas about what will
&gt; &gt; contribute to building a SUO, but unless this working group comes up with
&gt; &gt; an effective task-analytic method for the job, I think that it will just
&gt; &gt; go on with a process of seeing who can shout who down.  What I do not
&gt; &gt; understand is why somebody who believes that he or she has something

&gt; &gt; another one of those messages that say in effect &quot;I will not bring
&gt; &gt; my Imperial Circus to your town unless you clear the Arena first!&quot;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My guess is that there is a problematic dynamic affecting this community that
&gt; &gt; will not be solved by the stifling of one poet or the scaping of one goat, but
&gt; &gt; my guess is also that you will all insist on discovering that for yourself, and

&gt; &gt; | Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita 
&gt; &gt; | mi ritrovai per una selva oscura 
&gt; &gt; | che la diritta via era smarrita.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Midway upon the journey of our life
&gt; &gt; | I found myself within a forest dark, 
&gt; &gt; | For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

&gt; &gt; | If, walking in a garden on a dark night, you were suddenly
&gt; &gt; | to hear the voice of your sister crying to you to rescue her
&gt; &gt; | from a villain, would you stop to reason out the metaphysical
&gt; &gt; | question of whether it were possible for one mind to cause
&gt; &gt; | material waves of sound and for another mind to perceive them?
&gt; &gt; | If you did, the problem might probably occupy the remainder
&gt; &gt; | of your days.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce, &quot;Vitally Important Topics&quot;, CP 1.655.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; $~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; | Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason,
&gt; &gt; | that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so
&gt; &gt; | desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to
&gt; &gt; | think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves
&gt; &gt; | to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; |            Do not block the way of inquiry.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Although it is better to be methodical in our investigations,
&gt; &gt; | and to consider the economics of research, yet there is no
&gt; &gt; | positive sin against logic in 'trying' any theory which
&gt; &gt; | may come into our heads, so long as it is adopted in such
&gt; &gt; | a sense as to permit the investigation to go on unimpeded
&gt; &gt; | and undiscouraged.  On the other hand, to set up a philosophy
&gt; &gt; | which barricades the road of further advance toward the truth
&gt; &gt; | is the one unpardonable offence in reasoning, as it is also
&gt; &gt; | the one to which metaphysicians have in all ages shown
&gt; &gt; | themselves the most addicted.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce, &quot;The First Rule of Reason&quot;, CP 1.135-136.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; $~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; | Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of
&gt; &gt; | an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate
&gt; &gt; | in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert
&gt; &gt; | the elements of the original situation into a unified whole.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | John Dewey, &quot;Logic: The Theory of Inquiry&quot;, in 'John Dewey:
&gt; &gt; | The Later Works, 1925-1953, Volume 12: 1938', Edited by
&gt; &gt; | J.A. Boydston, Southern Illinois University Press,
&gt; &gt; | Carbondale, IL, 1986, page 108.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; $~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$~~~~~~~~~$
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; | This paper is based upon the theory already established,
&gt; &gt; | that the function of conceptions is to reduce the manifold
&gt; &gt; | of sensuous impressions to unity, and that the validity of
&gt; &gt; | a conception consists in the impossibility of reducing the
&gt; &gt; | content of consciousness to unity without the introduction
&gt; &gt; | of it.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce, &quot;On a New List of Categories&quot;, 14 May 1867,
&gt; &gt; | In 'Writings of Charles S. Peirce:  A Chronological Edition, Vol. 2,
&gt; &gt; | 1867-1871', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN, 1984, page 49,
&gt; &gt; | Customarily cited as (CE 2, 49).  Cf. 'Collected Papers', CP 1.545.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; By way of giving this question a proper form of inaugural,
&gt; &gt; I thought that I would share with you some of my favorite
&gt; &gt; quotations on the subject of inquiry, each one reflecting
&gt; &gt; a different facet of this resplendently fascinating topic.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; With regard to the bearing of the more poetic expressions,
&gt; &gt; I will leave you now to your own contemplations, and, for
&gt; &gt; the moment and the immediate future, I will focus on what
&gt; &gt; is evidently the most prosaic and derivative of the bunch,
&gt; &gt; where I think it sufficient to echo Peirce's echo of Kant.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe that this statement forms a cardinal expression --
&gt; &gt; embodying the heart and serving as the hinge -- for a very
&gt; &gt; important principle, one that goes a large part of the way
&gt; &gt; toward explaining how the information that is stored up in
&gt; &gt; an ontology, a &quot;body of ontological knowledge&quot; (BOOK), can
&gt; &gt; work to inform the progress of inquiries on which it bears.
