Occurents and continuants:

I'm certainly new at this, but I was becoming comfortable with the idea
that occurents depend necessarily on contintinuents  (my life depends on
me),
but that the continuents are not parts.  (I am not part of my life).
Mary's smile
depends on Mary, but isn't part of Mary.   The stabbing of Ceasar is a
stabbing
(occurent) that depends on Ceasar, Brutus, and a certain knife, (all
continuants),
but these aren't  _parts_ of the specific stabbing.     This seems quite at
odds
with much of the continuant-occurent discussion I see.

I've been away most of January and February till now, so I've certainly not
read
everything in this thread, but the idea of an occurant being a _part_ of a
continuent
bothers me.  I'm not sure if this makes me a non-extensionist...

&gt;
&gt; Can I suggest that we have a name change?
&gt; Can we talk about something such as bodies and events rather than
&gt; continuants and occurrents?
&gt; Occurrent and continuant are products of a 3-D
&gt; (Endurantisist) perspective
&gt; on ontology - and, I suggest that we let the holders of this
&gt; view keep them
&gt; (Nicola Guarino is, of course, also keen on this view). Typically
&gt; continuants are regarded as being completely present at any
&gt; times at which
&gt; they exist (whatever that means) - and occurrents as being temporally
&gt; extended (as explained in my earlier attachment). So they are
&gt; necessarily
&gt; disjoint. This does not cause showstoppers. Nicola Guarino
&gt; has just been
&gt; explaining to me that an ocean wave and a flame are
&gt; occurrents composed of
&gt; (disjoint) continuant masses. Though as Pat suggests it may
&gt; be simpler to
&gt; regard these as one.

I appreciate your objection to the Continuant/Occurrent terminology here,
but I think it would be wise if we didn't get hung up on the names of
concepts, at least not at this early juncture.  Names are, after all, only
names, and arguments about terminology could easily overshadow the
substantive issues of defining concepts and crafting axioms.  They could
also make it harder for us to communicate, if people find it difficult to
keep track of the currently preferred term for a particular concept.  I
suggest that we let the names stand for the time being, and that if a term
is found to be really objectionable by a majority of SUO participants, we
make the change at the end of the ontology design process.  Does this sound
reasonable?

&gt;
&gt; Ian suggests that "there is no overlap between ContinuantType and
&gt; OccurrentType. I think this needs clarification. If one is an
&gt; extensionalist, one would typically identify a thing with its
&gt; life (they
&gt; have exactly the same spatio-temporal (and modal) extension). So the
&gt; property of being a human life and being human would be the
&gt; same property
&gt; (as they have the same extension). So body-type and
&gt; event-type would not be
&gt; disjoint. However a non-extensionalist (such as an
&gt; endurantist) may prefer a
&gt; scheme where these were disjoint. It maybe useful if the SUO
&gt; strategy vis a
&gt; vis extensionalism were clarified (some baggage comes, of
&gt; course, with KIF).

This is a good point.  If we included 'Human' under 'ContinuantType' and
'Human-Life' under 'OccurrentType' in the merged ontology, then we would
violate the disjointness condition on ContinuantType/OccurrentType, because
'Human' and 'Human-Life' are co-extensional and we are assuming an
extensional interpretation of SUO-KIF.  I guess my response here would be
to
leave 'Human' under 'ContinuantType', to place 'Lifetime' (in the sense of
an organism's spacetime worm) under 'OccurrentType', and then to
compositionally create the concept of a human lifetime from these two
notions, e.g. the following:
