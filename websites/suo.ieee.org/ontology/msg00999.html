Dear Phil,
 
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: I think that "understandability" should be a criterion in
&gt; &gt; &gt; selecting a
&gt; &gt; &gt; language, though it is subjective...People tend to like 
&gt; what they've
&gt; &gt; &gt; developed or already learned...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: However, if we are to be successful inth elong run, we have
&gt; &gt; to make what
&gt; &gt; we are doing accessible. Graham has talked much about using 
&gt; ACE, or a
&gt; &gt; restricted form of ACE as one notation for the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Yes. The understandability issue for a formal language 
&gt; like KIF or EXIST
&gt; is the "learning curve" for newcomers to the language to 
&gt; understand it. ACE
&gt; seems to provide a very good route toward addressing 
&gt; understandability, so
&gt; another question is how easily can ACE map to a candidate 
&gt; formal language
&gt; like KIF or EXIST. So far, I do not sense that this is a 
&gt; major problem for
&gt; ACE, KIF, or EXIST..(?)

MW: Looking at the recent discussion here on translating into English, I
think that a rather restricted subset of ACE that closely corresponded to
KIF would be adequate. An informal explanation would also be relevant.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: This reminds me of the issue that is often discussed
&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the ease
&gt; &gt; &gt; of understandability and expressiveness of predicate calculus
&gt; &gt; &gt; vs. natural
&gt; &gt; &gt; language -- In particular, John Sowa has written about 
&gt; this issue in
&gt; &gt; &gt; comparing predicate calculus vs. conceptual graphs... It
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems possible that
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same kinds of arguments might translate to KIF (with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; same kinds of
&gt; &gt; &gt; rebuttals)...(?) This may be a way to address the
&gt; &gt; &gt; understandability and
&gt; &gt; &gt; expressiveness question...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Well there is another issue here, and that is that CG's have a
&gt; &gt; linguistic bias, which presupposes something of the nature 
&gt; of the ontology
&gt; &gt; you are going to create. Of course EXIST does the same thing with a
&gt; &gt; different bias.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Yes, which gets back to the question of what kinds of ontological
&gt; commitments are embedded  in the language that is chosen to 
&gt; express the
&gt; ontology...It would be interesting to compare and contrast 
&gt; KIF, EXIST, CG's,
&gt; etc. in terms of ontological commitments that they 
&gt; make...Perhaps someone
&gt; has already performed some of these comparisons?

MW: I know John Sowa is comfortable that KIF and CG's are consistent, and I
suspect that much the same is true for KIF and EXIST, so I think it largely
boils down to the other (non-technical) features of the language.
Technically, I agree with the approach of SUO-KIF of going for a minimalist
language - although it should notbe so minimalist that we can't do the job.
This is one reason why I have objected for so long and so consistently about
Nth domain, which is a VERY complex construct (even Pat H and Chris M seem
to have to think a bit about what it means) that has been introduced at the
ontlogy level, but really belongs at the language level - if we were to
accept it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: So yes EXIST could make a good starting point for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUO. However, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find here an assumption that KIF is the starting point, 
&gt; and I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considered it unwise for a newcomer like me to challenge this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: Hmmm....I think it is generally wise at the outset of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; great endeavor
&gt; &gt; &gt; to question all assumptions...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I think I have done (more than) my share of questioning here.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: No doubt, and I intend no criticism of you or anyone, 
&gt; except perhaps
&gt; myself. Perhaps I should have been asking questions and challenging
&gt; assumptions earlier...though I would be perceived (somewhat 
&gt; correctly) as
&gt; even more of a newcomer to the field of ontology... I guess 
&gt; my point is that
&gt; it is never too late to ask questions and challenge assumptions...
&gt; 

MW: Indeed. Failing to challenge things is another of those short cuts that
leads to a diversion or dead end in the long run.

&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Most of the objections I have been raising to our
&gt; &gt; &gt; current course are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on this experience. I know exactly where we are
&gt; &gt; &gt; currently headed -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: Can you summarize from your perspectives, what mistakes
&gt; &gt; &gt; are currently
&gt; &gt; &gt; being made by SUO (or towards which SUO is headed) and 
&gt; what you would
&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend to address them?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: The main lesson is that there are no short cuts, only 
&gt; diversions and
&gt; &gt; dead ends.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: "There is no royal road to geometry". We should avoid 
&gt; taking paths just
&gt; on the basis that they appear to be shortcuts toward reaching 
&gt; our goals...A
&gt; corollary is that adopting any existing ontology (or 
&gt; language) just on the
&gt; basis that it will advance us more quickly toward SUO could 
&gt; be a mistake --
&gt; whatever existing ontologies or languages are chosen should 
&gt; be examined
&gt; critically relative to requirements, theoretical limitations, 
&gt; etc. -- and we
&gt; should not avoid defining our requirements...

MW: Correct. At the moment I am concerned that we are not sufficiently aware
of what it will take to popularise what we are doing here. From what I can
see, most of the people (at least the active ones) here have a strong
technical background and are concerned about doing something of technical
value. One of my concerns is about how we get the world to use it. Any piece
of KIF more than about 2 lines long just gives me a headache - and I've been
working for two + years at improving my understanding of logic. My intuition
says that this is a barrier that is just too high for your average
programmer/engineer/linguist. So lowering this barrier is a critical success
factor for this initiative (unless all we want is a sense of self
satisfaction).

I see Chris Angus has put up a suggestion to use Topic Maps to help organise
the SUO. This is an excellent suggestion (IMHO) which would leverage a
popular technology (slated to be at the "heart of the semantic web") which
could do a lot for us as a vehicle and for Topic Maps in terms of providing
semantic content for there infrastructure framework.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Is SUO currently embarked on any paths that you recognize 
&gt; as diversions
&gt; or dead ends?

MW: I think we might have done (still could) if we took the route of
thinking that the work that Ian Niles has been doing is the beginning of the
end of developing a standard, rather than the end of the beginning. My
objection in the vote is related to taking what Ian has already done as a
start point for standardisation, rather than to the work he has done per se.
It has of course been extremely valuable to raise the issues that it has
done. Also the vote itself has meant that lots of stuff has come out of the
woodwork.
