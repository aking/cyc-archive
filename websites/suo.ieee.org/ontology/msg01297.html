Dear Pat,

&gt; 
&gt; "West, Matthew MR SSI-GREA-UK" &lt;Matthew.R.West@is.shell.com&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Dear Chris,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris P wrote:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Max Black's essay (referred to in an earlier email) 
&gt; starts with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quote from a working mathematician's book on set theory -
&gt; &gt; &gt; which claims
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that packs of wolves etc. are standard examples of sets.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A claim that is pretty obviously false.  A pack can 
&gt; change its members
&gt; &gt; &gt; (if, for example, a pup is born) and remain the same 
&gt; pack.  Not so the
&gt; &gt; &gt; set corresponding to the pack at any given time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Not so obviously in fact. You have assumed a 3D 
&gt; ontology, Chris and I
&gt; &gt;would assume a 4D ontology (I don't know about Max Black). 
&gt; In this case the
&gt; &gt;set of members of the flock is the spatio-temporal extent of 
&gt; all members of
&gt; &gt;the flock, past, present and future. This doesn't change over time.
&gt; 
&gt; No, you are missing the point, which can be described just as well in 
&gt; 4d as in 3d. Consider a wolf pack where one wolf gets left behind, 
&gt; gets lost and is then no longer part of the pack. In 4d this is a 
&gt; lone history that projects out'sideways' from the pack history, like 
&gt; a loose thread hanging off a unravelling cardigan. The point being 
&gt; that it is NOT part of the pack, so one cannot identify the (history 
&gt; of the) pack with the mereological union of the (histories of the) 
&gt; animals in the pack. Packs, like most collections, have their own 
&gt; special criteria both necessary for membership (being a wolf) and 
&gt; sufficient for membership (a complex kind of social acquaintance and 
&gt; mutual recognition, probably fully known only to wolves.) Wolves can 
&gt; also be absorbed into packs, by the way, so it works both ways round.

MW: I agree. A pack is an organisational level in our terms, and treating it
as a fusion is too simplistic. The smae would be true for the football team
example.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, what you say here is almost certainly wrong in any case, apart 
&gt; from lone-wolf examples. A spatiotemporal extent is not a set of 
&gt; members. 

MW: Sorry, me being sloppy with language.

&gt; You can have the pack be a spatiotemporal extent, if you 
&gt; want, though I think that would be severely inadequate for actual 
&gt; reasoning; or you could have it be a set, if you want, though again 
&gt; that has problems; but you definitely can't consistently have it be 
&gt; both at once.

MW: Agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I had the time, I am sure I could come up with other 
&gt; examples.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are lots of similar examples that go wrong for similar
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons --
&gt; &gt; &gt; flocks of geese, schools of fish, citizens of a country, sets
&gt; &gt; &gt; of dishes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; etc.  All of these collective entities can change their 
&gt; membership, at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least to some extent, and remain the same collective entity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not so the
&gt; &gt; &gt; corresponding sets at any given time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: These are sets too of course.
&gt; 
&gt; No, they aren't, at least in the way these collection-words are 
&gt; usually used. They have associated sets (which can change with time 
&gt; in a 3d ontology, or which might contain history-episodes rather than 
&gt; complete  histories, in a 4d ontology), but they cannot be identified 
&gt; with the sets of their members, because for example shoals have fish 
&gt; as members, not episodes of fish-histories.

MW: Yes I agree, but there is also the set of fish that are part of the
shoal at some poitn in time as well. This is not however the shoal of fish.

Regards  
      Matthew
