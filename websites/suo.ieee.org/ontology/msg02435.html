Dear Jon,

&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Please define "Join".
&gt;      It 'is' required to support 'your' view.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Au contraire it is required to support your view.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I will be truly surprised if a man of your considerable knowledge
&gt;      is not completely aware of what an SQL inner join is.  
&gt; If not I am
&gt;      inclined to suggest that you consult an SQL manual, or 
&gt; perhaps the
&gt;      SQL3 standard (if that is still the latest version) and 
&gt; look it up.
&gt;      If you do know I suggest you say where you are going instead of
&gt;      playing games.  It would really be nice to get to the point here.
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; What is important here?
&gt; 
&gt; You have put forth a claim that all k-adic relations
&gt; can be defined in terms of at most 2-adic relations.

MW: Well lets be careful, because I speak from experience, not
proof. I have not come across anything that cannot be represented
by dyadic relations alone.
&gt; 
&gt; This, if true, would be important for almost too many reasons
&gt; to mention, ranging from achieving maximum clarity and optimal
&gt; efficiency in everything from our basic conceptual frameworks
&gt; to our computational implementations of relational databases
&gt; and logical knowledge bases.  If it is not true, then there
&gt; are many reasons why we need to know that, too, as it bears
&gt; on the question of a "minimally adequate resource base" for
&gt; supporting all of these tasks and more.

MW: OK, I'd just like to get there sooner rather than later.
&gt; 
&gt; Aside from the content of the specific claim that you have made,
&gt; of a sort that is commonly recognized in all formal disciplines
&gt; to require of its proposer either a detailed definition or an
&gt; explicit proof, there is a way in which it can serve us as an
&gt; object example, of how and how not to carry on the activities
&gt; of analysis, clarification, construction, definition, proof,
&gt; and so on -- kind of like a test case to cut our teeth on,
&gt; to see whether we really know how to do these things in
&gt; such a way that we can eventually settle on clear ends.

MW: OK - but if everything takes this long we are in trouble.
&gt; 
&gt; So, all in all, I think that it is kind of important,
&gt; and I believe that clarity and effectiveness in all
&gt; of the components that I have just mentioned above
&gt; are topics of major import to the task of building
&gt; a SUO, and so I will continue to import them.
&gt; 
&gt; As to the present moment in our discussions,
&gt; I am afraid that ball remains in your court.
&gt; You have made a claim and you must defend it
&gt; or give it up -- I did not make up the rules.

MW: Ah, now I thought that I was challenging your 
claim that triadicity is irreducible, and you haven't 
substantiated that, so presumably you have given
that up? Specifically, you claimed that a particular
triadic form of an "and" relation could not be
represented by dyadic relations. I have done
that. As I see it you have to prove that it 
doesn't represent the triadic relation. The join
is irrelevant to the argument. It merely 
illustrates that the original information can be
presented. We could just as easily use some different
way of showing this, e.g. by asking specific questions 
and seeing if the information is there. So I think this
is a red herring.

&gt; I said that I would help you formalize it if
&gt; it could be formalized -- laying your hand
&gt; on this or that good book and swearing that
&gt; it's the truth may indeed be a common brand
&gt; of formalization, but it is not the species
&gt; that it is accepted in this court of inquiry,
&gt; and until you say where in what good book it
&gt; says so, no public forum can begin to examine
&gt; your evidence.  I am perfectly aware of what
&gt; logical operations are logically involved in
&gt; the construction of all sorts of joins, and
&gt; I have been since the days when I grad-assed
&gt; as a data archivist and statistical programmer,
&gt; which is why I do not say the things you say,
&gt; but it is you who cannot see the AND's at
&gt; the bottom of these nests, and so I have
&gt; been trying to magnify them for you,
&gt; because you still seem to me like
&gt; an honest entomologist.

MW: I am aware that you seem to think that "and"
is some how critical here, but I don't really
understand why.
&gt; 
&gt; There are, indeed, even larger reasons why this point is important,
&gt; and specifically with regard to the problems of intercommunication
&gt; and interoperation, which, as you can well appreciate, are not any
&gt; kinds of new problems that have just appeared on the human horizon,
&gt; but have, in effect if not in essence, been with us since we began
&gt; to be human.  And folks like me who have spent a lifetime not just
&gt; speculating on these problems from our armchairs but who have come
&gt; up against the obstinate resilience and the obstructive resistance
&gt; of these barriers to just about everything that we try to do, well,
&gt; we take these problems deadpan seriously -- humor, to those in the
&gt; know, is just a symptom of how deadly serious we know it, at heart,
&gt; to be -- and some of us even fancy that we may have learned one or
&gt; two things from the knocks that we have taken, although, of course,
&gt; it could be nothing more than the final stages of punch-drunkeness.

MW: Well it is of course in solving these interoperation
problems - the problem that lead to all the work I have done over the 
last 10-15 years, that we have found "reducing" things to a binary 
form to be so useful. The reason being that it does not impose constraints
that do not always apply, which sometimes are imposed by non-binary
relations. We then found this seemed to work for everything we wished 
to hold. This was then just convenient to know and use from time to
time.

INNER JOIN
 A SQL equality join condition. Rows from two tables are joined if the
columns match exactly. The most common join condition. Rows that have no
match in the other table are not displayed.

MW:I found it in a glossary somewhere on the web, but it looks OK to me.
