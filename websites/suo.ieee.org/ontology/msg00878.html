Dear Pat,

I only asked if there was an established terminology in logical circles for
occurences of relations ....

See some comments below, but basically I agree (where I understand)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Dear John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The real problem with relationship and relation is that they 
&gt; are frequently
&gt; &gt;used both to refer to classes and instances.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For example, when we talk about the lines on entity 
&gt; relationship diagrams,
&gt; &gt;we call them relationships (perhaps more properly a class of 
&gt; relationship)
&gt; &gt;yet we also talk about my marriage to my wife as a 
&gt; relationship (occurance).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In logic I notice that the more experienced tend to use 
&gt; "relation" for what
&gt; &gt;would be a class, or predicate, and not the occurances of 
&gt; it. It is not
&gt; &gt;clear (to me) that there is an established terminology for 
&gt; the occurances.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I am blinded by the limitations of a mathematical education, 
&gt; but I see no problem here. A relation (let us stick to binary 
&gt; predicates for simplicity) such as Married is a set of 2-tuples, ie a 
&gt; set of pairs. If a particular pair, such as
&gt; &lt;MWest, WifeofMWest&gt;, is in the set of pairs called 'Married', then 
&gt; we say that the relation(ship) of being married holds between them, 
&gt; or (more colloquially) that they are married. In KIF this would be 
&gt; written
&gt; (Married MWest WifeofMWest), and it asserts that a relation holds 
&gt; between two things, ie that that pair of things is 'in' the relation, 
&gt; which in a somewhat different terminology can be phrased as saying 
&gt; that the relationship between them is an instance of the Married 
&gt; relation.
&gt; 
&gt; This last use of "instance" corresponds exactly to the usage for 
&gt; unary predicates. A unary predicate is simply a set, and an 
&gt; "instance" of it is a member of that set. Thus for example if red is 
&gt; the predicate - excuse me, the unary relation - I mean, the property, 
&gt; of being red, then something is (an instance of) red just when it is 
&gt; a member of that set (of all the red things.). Similarly, two people 
&gt; are an instance of Marriage just when, taken together as a pair, they 
&gt; are in the corresponding set (of all married couples).

MW: Yes you are blinded by a mathematical and logical education.

Mere mortals may have quite a different tradition of speach.

In EPISTLE for example we started out having lots of fun with people talking
about "products" or "activities" and it being completely ambiguous whether a
class or an individual was meant. We talked just as blythely about "the
analysis activity" (a class of activity) as we do about "the sports activity
on this Thursday afternoon" (an individual).

For ourselves we decided on a rule that we mostly stick to, which is that
words like activity, and for that matter relation when used alone apply to
the instance/individual level, and that at the class level we add class as a
qualifier, so activity class and relation class. It is a little unnatural at
times, but it does make things explicit.

Hence all the recent discussion. The main point of course is to be aware of
the potential for ambiguity, and since one is in mixed company not to assume
the same background or usage of language.
&gt; 
&gt; It is important to notice that a particular thing can be in many 
&gt; different sets, and a particular pair can be in many different sets 
&gt; of pairs. There is a special set which is unique to any given pair, 
&gt; which is the set which contains ONLY that pair and no other. This is 
&gt; also a relation, but a very special one.  Another way to think about 
&gt; instances is that this unique relation (in our example, it is the 
&gt; relation which holds only between MW and his wife, and relates no 
&gt; other individuals: it might be called their particular marriage 
&gt; relationship) is a subset of the married relation, ie subrelation of 
&gt; it: a thing of the same kind,  but very specialised; in fact, it is 
&gt; as specialised as a binary relation can get.

MW: Yes, a singleton. Useful for queries on databases, but not much 
else for me so far. The real thing is to remember that the singleton is
still
a class and not its member.
&gt; 
&gt; This 'extensional' way of thinking about relations has the merit of 
&gt; corresponding to logical analysis and, if used carefully, to much of 
&gt; ordinary usage.  What it fails to do, however, is provide a more 
&gt; delicate distinction which some folk have suggested is necessary in 
&gt; an ontology which can reflect the distinctions made in natural 
&gt; language, which is that between the various *ways* that a relation 
&gt; might hold. For example, suppose that we say that being wise is a 
&gt; property (of people), which is true of Socrates (for example) but not 
&gt; true of our current President (for example). That seems harmless, but 
&gt; someone might object that he wants to not just say that Socrates is 
&gt; wise, but to say something more particular about the particular way 
&gt; that he was wise: to say something, as we might phrase it, about 
&gt; Socrates' wisdom, as opposed to wisdom in general. ("How do I love 
&gt; thee? Let me count the ways..." If 'love' is a set of pairs, there's 
&gt; no counting to be done.) 

MW: My simple approach to this would be to have subtypes of wisdom that
represented the different ways in which you could be wise. You would be wise
if you were a member of any of them, but you could also be wise in many ways
by being a member of several. Am I missing something?

MW: A key assumption here of course is that relations can have subtypes (it
seems reasonable, but since these are predicates I'm not sure what the
situation is). Canyou enlighten me?

&gt; Some have argued that the need to be able to 
&gt; talk about 'tropes' such as these requires a richer ontology of 
&gt; relations: we need, it is argued, to be able to speak of a relation 
&gt; not just as something with an extension, but as having some other 
&gt; aspects as well, so that there is more to being wise than just being 
&gt; in a particular set: there is also the particular 'way' that you are 
&gt; in the set, or the 'glue' that binds you to the set, or some such 
&gt; locution. 

MW: Seems consistent with what I suggest below, it is the subtype(s) you are
a member of that binds you to the supertype.

&gt; (The notion of 'nexus' in Sowa's upper ontology is related 
&gt; to this intuition, I believe, as is the general idea of a 'situation' 
&gt; or 'predication'; all of these, in their various ways, seem to be 
&gt; entities which are introduced to stand for a kind of focus of where a 
&gt; relation, or collection of relations, holds true of a set of things. 
&gt; "trope", a distinctly exotic Australian philosopher's word, is 
&gt; apparently the general-purpose technical term.)

MW: This went straight over my head, so if it was important please explain.
&gt; 
&gt; I said that an extensional view of relations fails to deal with 
&gt; tropes; but it is consistent with an ontology of tropes. It just 
&gt; means that you have to be explicit about the 'ways', and mention them 
&gt; directly, instead of expecting the notion of 'relation' to do it for 
&gt; you for free. 

MW: This would be very consistent with our approach in EPISTLE, which is
always to try to make the implicit explicit.

&gt; And there are many such proposals in the literature, 
&gt; including Jerry Hobb's 'promiscuous ontology' which Ive mentioned 
&gt; before in these discussions, the fairly standard 'event' ontological 
&gt; style based on case grammar, where a mere predication is rendered as 
&gt; an existence claim plus a collection of binary case relations (agent, 
&gt; object, patient, time, place, ....), the Sanskrit variation, and the 
&gt; various ideas of 'thirdness' arising from Pierce's philosophy. All of 
&gt; these can be seen as ways of extending the ontology - introducing new 
&gt; kinds of entities in addition to the things that yer average naive 
&gt; realist might think of - in order to allow finer ways of 
&gt; distinguishing ways that things can be true which are more subtle 
&gt; than the starkly simple crudity of being in a set. 

MW: But I haven't seen (or at least not understood) anything yet that
required more than the membership of something in some set to "do the
business", plus some relation occurences (logic speak) and some
axioms/rules.

&gt; But the LOGICAL 
&gt; point is that by making these things explicit, one can manage with a 
&gt; purely extensional notion of relation.  If you want a complex notion 
&gt; of relationship, the ontological moral is, identify as clearly as 
&gt; possible what it is that makes your notion of 'relation' so complex, 
&gt; then get that complexity out into the open;  make it into an actual 
&gt; thing, and relieve the notion of 'relation' of that extra ontological 
&gt; burden. If relations vary with time, make times explicit; if they 
&gt; have different ways of being true, make the ways explicit; if they 
&gt; can be true in some worlds but not in others, make the worlds 
&gt; explicit.  Insisting the relations are purely extensional forces 
&gt; everyone to get all their hidden ontological assumptions onto the 
&gt; logical table where everyone else can see them.

MW: OK by now we are a long way from what to call a relation occurrence, but
I do strongly agree.
