Adam, Aldo, Chris, John, Matthew, Michael, Pat, Phil, Robert^2, ...

Here is how I touch on the issue of existence versus reality --
sounds like a losing battle to me! -- in my dissertation work.
I draw on the crucially important distinction that Peirce makes
between existence and reality, a scruple that Peirce borrows from
the Medieval Scholastics, who apparently coined the term "reality"
in the sense that we, however half-consciously, half of the time,
currently use it, and the license of whose sense they certified
on the basis of the complex of terms in their Latin thesaurus
that stems from the Latin word "res", roughly for "thing",
but not just any thing, but a thing, a matter, an affair
that is of interest or concern to the likes of us, and
that, above all, has properties, and not just "has"
properties, in the weasly way that the attentuated
translation through the word "has" gives to us,
a word that spends half of its time being used
as an ancillary auxiliary, expressing no will
of its own, but "has" with the entire credit,
and faith, and power, and strength that its
etymological ancestor, the Greek verb "echein",
the root of our many-borrowed modern "schemes",
originally gave it, to have and to hold, with all
of that fierce independence that says "this place,
this time, for aye, but only in token of a greater".

Anyway, these issues have been coming up a lot in my dissertation work:

<A  HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm</A>

There are a few bits of it about half-way through Subsection 1.3.4.14,
entitled "Application of OF (Objective Framework):  Generic Level" --
jumping just a little bit abruptly into the "media" of the "res":

| In spite of the apparent duality between these patterns of
| composition, there is a significant asymmetry to be observed
| in the way that the insistent theme of realism interrupts the
| underlying genre.  To understand what this means, it is necessary
| to note that the strain of pragmatic thinking I am using here takes
| its definition of "reality" from the word's original Scholastic sources,
| where the adjective "real" means "having properties".  Taken in this sense,
| "reality" is necessary but not sufficient to "actuality", where the word
| "actual" means "existing in act and not merely potentially" (Webster's).
| To reiterate the same thing from the converse direction, actuality is
| sufficient but not necessary to reality.  The distinction between
| the two ideas is further pointed up by the fact that a potential
| can be real, and that its reality can be independent of any
| particular moment in which the power acts.
|
| These "angelic doctrines" would probably remain distant from
| the present concern, were it not for two points of connection:
|
| 1.  Relative to the present genre, the distinction of reality,
|     that can be granted to certain objects of thought and not
|     to others, fulfills an analogous role to the distinction
|     that singles out "sets" among "classes" in modern versions
|     of set theory.  Taking the membership relation "€" as a
|     predecessor relation in a pre-designated hierarchy of classes,
|     a class attains the status of a set, and by dint of this becomes
|     an object of determinate discussion, simply if it has successors.
|     Pragmatic reality is distinguished from both the medieval and the
|     modern versions, however, by the fact that its reality is always
|     a reality to someone.  This is due to the circumstance that it
|     takes both an abstract property and a concrete interpreter to
|     establish the practical reality of an object.

So, you see, reality is not a matter of taking the summit,
in ever-widening gyres of contest and context, in a futile
game of one-up-man-ship -- and yes, for some reason, it is
prototypically and schematically just men -- but of being
subject, of exemplifying the properties that one holds.

That's all that I have on my mind at the moment,

Jon Awbrey
