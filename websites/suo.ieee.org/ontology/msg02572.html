&gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here's a chance for me to ask some of my favorite questions again:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  a.  What forms of reasoning are involved in the decision of
&gt; &gt;         a DBA [or a KBA] to create, modify, remove a concept
&gt; &gt;         [in/of/from] the conceptual base?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     b.  Can these putative forms of reasoning
&gt; &gt;         be computationally formalized?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not John, but if I as a DBA might answer:
&gt; 
&gt; I don't create, modify, or remove a concept [in/of/from] a conceptual base.

I was trying to be concise for a change, the price of which
is that I had to try and paint this image of changing bases
in very broad brush stokes indeed.  See my amendments above.
You may well speculate on how I decided what amends to make.

It may serve a little to think of a Deductive Data Base or a Knowledge Base,
but really all I have in mind here is any sort of significant restructuring.

&gt; I create, modify, or remove
&gt; a field/column/data-element
&gt; from a file/table/structure.

Now, if you really think about it, a table is like a concept,
namely, a concept of some relation that you find to be of use.
Think about the way a medical research database changes when
somebody hypothesizes a new disease entity, starts to keep
tabs on its signs, symptoms, test results, mortality data,
and then either confirms or discards the notion.

&gt; Some of those fields/columns/data-elements represent
&gt; concepts or groups of concepts.  Some do not.

You hadda go and make me say it:
"Everything is just a concept".
(Sorta).

&gt; I usually recognize that someone has a need/concept that is not being
&gt; adequately represented by the existing database so I need to change it.
&gt; If intent can be computationally formalized, then the reasoning should
&gt; be capable of being computationally formalized.
&gt; 
&gt; Most systems don't have any representation of intent.
&gt; A barely adequate one might have intent represented in
&gt; a user help manual.  A system that integrates its help
&gt; system with the actual working of the program is very
&gt; rare.  In some better cases, the help system is only
&gt; text associated with the operations being performed
&gt; so that context sensitive help may be provided.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2.  a.  What entropic pressures or informational tensions
&gt; &gt;         determine a decision to introduce, modify, delete
&gt; &gt;         concepts, symbols, terms to/in/from the manifold
&gt; &gt;         of those already present in the system?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     b.  Can these pressures or tensions be localized and measured?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; Do you include an end-user dropping by my office with
&gt; a confused look on their face as an entropic pressure?

Good example.  Now tell me, why are they confused?
What is confusion, anyway?  Now that I mention it,
how did I get so confused about what confusion is?

Serially now, folks, entropy is just a measure on
a distribution, say, a distribution of things you
might choose from as being true, or as being good
things to do if &amp; when you do decide what is true.

  Thing1   Thing2          Thing1   Thing2          Thing1   Thing2

 High Entropy Case        Low Entropy Case 1       Low Entropy Case 2

So high entropy, or high uncertainty, means that you do not know much
about what is true or what to do in the question of Thing1 and Thing2.
It does not matter if it's a declarative goo or an imperative stew --
it's all pretty much the same to you.

&gt; What about an error-report on the system exceptions log?
&gt; 
&gt; What about a failure description generated by
&gt; an internal consistency check program?
&gt; 
&gt; and what is the manifold of my data base system?
&gt; is this like the manifold of math?
&gt; or the manifold of a car?

I Know But I Kant Tell You.

&gt; Are you talking about localizing and measuring
&gt; the decisions or the tensions and pressures?
&gt; Or are you talking about local-izing in some
&gt; physical sense?  or just localized in some
&gt; conceptual cluster?

It's an essay question.
You get to use your imagination.
Give me time to make something up.

Jon Awbrey
