&gt;   I believe that the question of granularity in the context of
&gt;divisible "stuff" is distinct from the issues in the heap paradox,
&gt;but I agree that the paradox only arises because of the
&gt;vagueness of the notion of "heap" or "large".

Well, yes, but be careful. The *limits* of what makes a heap large 
are imprecise, but I would claim that the concepts of 'heap' and 
'large' are no more vague than most other concepts used in any 
physical ontology. Large heaps can have some very sharp properties. I 
recall when a large heap of mine tailings killed an entire school 
full of Welsh kids.

There is a strategy often adopted here which goes: concepts like 
'heap' are vague; vague concepts reflect sloppy thinking; so we won't 
allow such vague concepts in our ontology, and feel proud of our 
tidyness. As well as simply ignoring an interesting problem of 
practical importance, this strategy trades on a confusion between 
'vague' in the sense of imprecise, and 'vague' in the sense of 
ill-defined.

&gt;    In my own efforts, I have always assumed that notions such as
&gt;"heap" or "large" must be defined in terms of some absolute
&gt;limit of quantity.

As I said, this approach has the merit of ignoring the issue, rather 
than solving it. It also has the (to me fatal) disadvantage of having 
obviously false consequences, such as the following:

&gt;        Then at some point removal of a grain drops the
&gt;resulting pile below the limit, and no paradox ensues. One might define
&gt;a "heap" to be as small as ten.  "large" is very dependent on context,
&gt;ans might need many different definitons depending on context.

But then that begs the question. If truths can be dependent on 
'context' then we can just say that 'large heap' depends on context. 
How do you cash out this contextuality in axioms?

&gt;A start might be, e.g. three times some mean number, or a size more
&gt;than one standard deviation above the mean.

Jerry Hobbs suggest three half-orders of magnitude, and marshals some 
impressive linguistic evidence to justify this choice.

&gt;   I can imagine using such precise limits in definitions as being
&gt;problematic only in some rare cases of language understanding, but
&gt;since multiple reiterative processes are seldom referred to in normal
&gt;language, I suspect that using a limit will work in just about every
&gt;practical situation.

Oh, come ON!  Engineers and practical folk have to reason about 
multiple repetition all the time. Ask a blacksmith. Think of issues 
of rate of wear of machine parts. Even biologists have to think about 
cumulative error rates in DNA replication.

&gt;   I assume hat we are trying to avoid fuzzy logic, which is
&gt;intended to deal with precisely these situations.

That was my option number 2. Yes, I am ignoring it.

&gt;   If someone objects to using precise limits for notions like
&gt;"large" or "heap", I would very much like to learn of an
&gt;example in some practical case where this presents a problem.

See above.
My own worry is that all of the proposed solutions are really ways of 
patching round or avoiding the central problem, but I want to 
actually solve it. It seems quite obvious to me both that the 
antecedents of the paradox are correct - heaps are finite, may be 
large, and removing a single grain from a large heap never, in 
itself, makes a large heap small  - and that the conclusion is 
absurd, and yet that the reasoning has no obvious flaws in it. And I 
can even explain how this arises: obviously, it is because a lot of 
differences which are each too small to detect can add up to one that 
is detectable. The conclusion that I draw from this is that it is in 
fact inadmissible to use mathematical reasoning (such as induction) 
on many predicates which are nevertheless of clear utility in 
ordinary reasoning. The paradox comes from identifying size of heap 
with number of grains in the heap. Which gets us hard against the 
issue of granularity, of course, and how to describe it.

People can rapidly and easily move between alternative views of 
something: thinking of a lump of clay as a lump, or as a mass of 
grains held together by water, for example; and we are very good at 
transferring some properties from one view to another, but not 
transferring others, all the while not getting too confused. We don't 
have good ways to do this kind of trick in our ontologies yet, 
however. If we ever do, I suspect that things like the heap paradox 
will become as trivial to our ontologies as they are to any 
ten-year-old human thinker.

&gt;Law perhaps???
&gt;   I would also very much like to learn if someone can
&gt;provide an overview of the current methods for logically treating
&gt;precision, approximation, and measurement error.  This is
&gt;indeed critical for handling many engineering situations
&gt;as well as for common sense.

There are entire curricula in engineering schools devoted to this 
topic. It is too large to summarize in email. (If you really mean 
LOGICALLY treating, then I know of none.)

PS. The related spatial version of the heap paradox arises when 
trying to say where exactly things like 'the midwest' or 'the 
outback' (in Australia) start. One approach to this is to say that 
there is a precise edge, like a state boundary, but nobody knows 
where it is.  Another is to say that staments about 'the midwest' are 
in fact hidden quantifiers over all the places anyone could draw the 
edges, eg 'the midwest is boring' says that any place that could be 
described as 'midwest' is boring. Could these be adapted to your 
'edge-of-largeness' approach?
