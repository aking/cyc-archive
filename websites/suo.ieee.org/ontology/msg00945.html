Hi Pat,

Two small points below:

&gt;Can I suggest that we have a name change?
&gt;Can we talk about something such as bodies and events rather than
&gt;continuants and occurrents?

Well, there is a problem with that. Both spatiotemporal
extensionalists like Matthew West and myself, and 3-d Endurantists
(thanks for that terrific word, Chris) like Nicola and Peter Simons,
CP: As you know not mine - but Davis Lewis's.
will agree that we need to be able to describe bodies and events. The
issue is over HOW to describe them. We had this kind of
terminological discussion at Heidelberg, and Peter defended the
long-winded kind of terminology on the grounds precisely that it
WASNT 'intuitive', and therefore one didnt slip into the eternal trap
of two people using the same word to refer to two different things
without even being aware of it. Ordinary words are just too
comfortable when we are doing ontology: every one can agree on facts
about bodies and events, but they arent necessarily agreeing about
how to formalise those facts, which is our central business.

CP: I agree, non-intuitive words serve a good purpose. But a less than good
purpose when we use them in a different and novel way, when they have well
established meanings. I was only suggesting that we try and stick to
occurrent and continuant's original established technical meaning.
&gt;Occurrent and continuant are products of a 3-D (Endurantisist) perspective
&gt;on ontology - and, I suggest that we let the holders of this view keep them
&gt;(Nicola Guarino is, of course, also keen on this view). Typically
&gt;continuants are regarded as being completely present at any times at which
&gt;they exist (whatever that means) - and occurrents as being temporally
&gt;extended (as explained in my earlier attachment). So they are necessarily
&gt;disjoint. This does not cause showstoppers. Nicola Guarino has just been
&gt;explaining to me that an ocean wave and a flame are occurrents composed of
&gt;(disjoint) continuant masses. Though as Pat suggests it may be simpler to
&gt;regard these as one.

Simpler in spades. It is of course *possible* to choose one way of
looking at a thing like a flame or a wave, and simply declare that
this is the 'proper' view, and thereby place it firmly into one of
the rigid classifications of an endurantist philosophical
classification. Ive had this debate with Nicola, and he has a sure
hand at doing this. However, this gives rise to ghastly problems when
one actually gets down to the nitty-gritty axiomatic details. In
order to reason about something like a flame, one needs to sometimes
think of it as enduring like an object, keeping its identity through
time, and sometimes to think of it as a dynamic process. Often, as
for example expressing something like 'a gas flow rate which produces
a manifold pressure below the critical value will cause flame loss
and require re-ignition within five seconds to avoid an automatic
emergency call', quite simple pieces of physical knowledge require
that these different 'views' are interleaved very rapidly, sometimes
in the same axiom. (For another example, try formalizing the
reasoning behind the conclusion that one should not drink from a cup
which has been dipped into a sewer and then filled with clean water.)
For an endurantist like Nicola, the only option is to introduce *two*
things here: the flame-as-process and the flame-as-entity (like
distinguishing a person from their life), and to say one type of
things about one of them and the other about the other of them, and
have elaborate axioms connecting them together in appropriate ways.
For example, we might have to say explicitly that for any time during
the lifetime, it is true at that time that the life is being (notice
the use of the continuous tense, suitable only for processes) the
life of the thing. And this is possible, but it is all UNNECESSARY.
Why should we be forced into such torture, to satisfy Nicola's (or
Peter's, or John Sowa's, or Niles's, or mine for that matter)
philosophical/linguistic feelings about what needs to be
distinguished from what?

BTW, to elaborate on another message I sent in reply to Niles, many
of these categorizations derive from natural language usage. NL
structures (case distinctions, the verb/noun distinction, and such
things as temporal aspect) often do suggest exactly this kind of
distinction, and have motivated much of the relevant philsophical
work that underpins it (such as the absurd doctrine that all
occurrents can only be individuated by a connecting continuant.) But
it is vitally important to bear in mind that NL is NOT an ontology
language. It evolved for human communication in real time, between
creatures living in a 'present'. It is a fundamentally tensed,
indexical language used for highly context-dependent  communication
betwseen intelligent agents about an essentially 3-d world. Our
ontologies, to be any use at all, need to stay true throughout time;
they are not in a tensed or indexical langauge; they cannot rely on
the intelligence or quick-wittedness of the reader,  and they are
being used largely to support reasoning, not to communicate immediate
facts about the local circumstances of a speech act. This is
basically why linguistic intutions do more harm than good in
practical ontology design.
In any case, I would add, more up-to-date empirical work on languages
has often shown that the categorisations of earlier analyses are
simplistic. English nominalisation, in particular, almost destroys
the noun/verb distinction in practice.

&gt;Ian suggests that "there is no overlap between ContinuantType and
&gt;OccurrentType. I think this needs clarification. If one is an
&gt;extensionalist, one would typically identify a thing with its life (they
&gt;have exactly the same spatio-temporal (and modal) extension). So the
&gt;property of being a human life and being human would be the same property
&gt;(as they have the same extension). So body-type and event-type would not be
&gt;disjoint. However a non-extensionalist (such as an endurantist) may prefer
a
&gt;scheme where these were disjoint. It maybe useful if the SUO strategy vis a
&gt;vis extensionalism were clarified (some baggage comes, of course, with
KIF).

I agree. I think that this is the same issue which Matthew West has
been raising, put into different language.
