| 1.  Introduction (cont.)
|
| Though the studies of differential geometry began in geodesy and in dynamics
| where intuition can be a faithful guide, the spaces now in this geometry's
| concern are far more general.  Instead of considering a set of three or
| six real functions on a space of vectors of three or six dimensions,
| spaces can be described by longer ordered strings of numbers, by
| sets of numbers ordered in various ways, or by ordered sets of
| products of numbers.  Examples are n-dimensional vector spaces,
| matrices, or multilinear objects like tensors.  It is not just
| these sets of numbers, but also the rules one has of passing
| from one set to another that form the proper subject matter
| of differential geometry, linking it to matters of interest
| in control.
|
| All analytic considerations of geometry begin with a space filled with stacks
| of numbers.  Before one can proceed to discuss the relations that associate
| one point with another or dictate what point follows another, one has to
| establish certain ground rules.  The ground rules that say if one point
| can be distinguished from another, or that there is a point close enough
| to wherever you want to go, are referred to as topological considerations.
| The basic description of the topological spaces underlying all the geometry
| of this paper is given in an appendix on fundamentals of vector calculus.
| This appendix discusses such desired topological characteristics
| as compactness and continuity, which is needed to preserve these
| characteristics in passing from one space to another.  The appendix
| concludes by recalling two theorems from vector calculus that provide
| the basic glue by which manifolds, the word for the fundamental spaces
| of global differential geometry, are assembled.  Since this discussion is
| fundamental to differential geometry, we briefly review it.  The review is
| relegated to an appendix, however, because it is not the topic of this book,
| nor should one dwell on it.
|
| The first two chapters of the body of the book describe manifolds, the spaces
| of our geometry.  Some simple manifolds are mentioned.  Several definitions are
| given, starting with one closest to intuition then passing to one perhaps more
| abstract, but actually less demanding to verify in cases of interest in control
| engineering.  Then mappings between manifolds are considered.  A special space,
| the tangent space, is discussed in chapter 3.  A tangent space is attached to
| every point in the manifold.  Since this is where the calculus is done, it and
| its relations to neighboring tangent spaces and to the manifold that supports it
| must be carefully described.
|
| Computation in these spaces is the topic of the next few chapters.
| Calculus on manifolds is given in chapter 4 on vector fields and
| their algebra, where the connection between global differential
| geometry and linear and nonlinear control begins to become clear.
| Chapters 5 and 6, which treat some algebraic rules, conclude our
| exposition of the fundamentals of the geometry.
|
| The examples given as the development unfolds should not only help the reader
| understand the topic under discussion but should also provide a basic set for
| testing ideas presented in the current literature.  Chapter 7 is intended to
| give the reader a glimpse of the structure supporting the spaces in which
| linear control operates.  More comprehensive applications of differential
| geometry to control are given in the final major chapter of the paper.
