| O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell,
| and count myself a king of infinite space,
| were it not that I have bad dreams.
|
| 'Hamlet', 2.2

Back tale my hie now must I to my little kingdom tiny,
where, and while, might I then do my tiny bit of good,
there, wherefore be accounted a comparative folk hero.

In the light of sundry remarks that emanated from the
direction of John Sowa last week, before we evanesced
on ever more intense refinements of preservèd meaning,
I found myself in a sufficiently irradiated condition
that I might well have jumped ahead a bit in my story,
to orbits where that north-north-west passage between
model theory and proof theory inchoately begins to be
visible, at any rate, at least, to the sensitive eyes
in such orbs that have long enough rested in darkness.

Since it is such an old thread already, languishing
at all odds and ends through the interval all since,
I will tack the basic reference matter onto the end.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Where I left you last is where I found myself some twenty years or so ago,
with my scribbles refined to what I thought at the time was sans critical.
So I sat down to the computer to play, or so I thought, a song in my mind
of sectus empiricus, where logic and proof would come now to save the day.
Here was my hubris, I confess it now openly as I said it then loudly that
"Of course I am proceeding proof-theoretically, for model theory is dumb!"

The rest is less hysterical ...

If you scan the reference material at the end of this note,
you will notice two distinct qualities to the proofs there.
One brand has that "Falling off a log and rolling downhill"
sort of quality that is earnestly to be wished for but not
so often met with, at least, never so often -- like always! --
that we cannot but help to wish for.  The other kind, more
kith o' death than kind, has a quality strained sans mercy,
with that "How in the heck did anybody ever think of that?"
sort of quality that all too unfortunately rules the roost
as soon as one takes in more and more complex bits to test.

Thereby hangs the rest of my tale ...

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~REFERENCE~MATERIALS~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Here is a reference version of the CSP-GSB axioms and
first few theorems for the abstract calculus formally
knowable in a couple of senses as propositional logic.

For ease of future reference, I list here the exact forms of the axioms that I use,
devolving from Peirce's "Logical Graphs" via Spencer-Brown's "Laws of Form" (LOF).
In formal proofs, I will use the annotation scheme from LOF to mark each step of
the proof according to which axiom (or "initial") is being invoked to justify
the corresponding step of syntactic transformation, on graphs or on strings.

The axioms are just four in number,
divided into two types, as follows:
the "Arithmetic Initials" I1 and I2,
the "Algebraic  Initials" J1 and J2.

(I use a trivially different J1 here.)

Notice that all of the axioms in this set have the form of equations.
This means that all of the inference steps they allow are reversible.
In the proof annotation scheme below, I will use a double bar "====="
to mark this fact, but I may at times leave it to the reader to pick
which direction is the one required for applying the indicated axiom.

As you are undoubtedly aware, Peirce introduced these formal equations
at a level of abstraction that is one step higher than their customary
interpretations as propositional calculi, which two readings for logic
he called the "Entitative" and the "Existential" interpretations, and
so I will refer to the interpreted systems of graphs as "EnG" &amp; "ExG",
respectively.  The early CSP, as in his essay on "Qualitative Logic",
and also GSB, emphasized the EnG interpretation, while the later CSP
developed mostly the ExG interpretation.  When it comes down to this
very primitive level of formal structure, I find it important to note
and I even tend to stress the formal significance of the circumstance
that this formal system is a "very abstract calculus" (VAC), devoid of
meaning in the usual logical sense.  I cannot speak for how this works
out or what it might mean beyond this point, on the next levels of form.

The first theorem is known as the "Double Negation Theorem" (DNT).
The proof that succeeds it is derived from the one that was given
by George Spencer Brown in his book 'Laws of Form', and credited
to two of his students, John Dawes and D.A. Utting.  This result
is annotated as "Consequence 1" (C1) or as "Reflection" in LOF.

One theorem of frequent use is what I like to call
the "Weed and Seed" Theorem.  The proof is just an
inductive exercise, so I will let it go till later,
but it says that a label can be freely distributed
or freely erased (retracted or withdrawn) anywhere
in a subtree whose root is labeled with that label.
The second theorem on the list to be shown here is
actually the base case of this Weed &amp; Seed theorem.
I talk about it under the LOF name of "Generation".

The third theorem to be proved here is one that GSB

as a matter of "Dominance or Recession" among forms.
