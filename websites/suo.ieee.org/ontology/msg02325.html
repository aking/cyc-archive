Strand 3.  Embedded Tables &amp; Extended Relations

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

JA:  There were a few issues about "embedded", "indexed", "keyed",
     or "ordered" relational tables that were initially raised in
     the present frame, and so I will try to address them now, at
     least until the running accumulation of bits grows too large.

JA:  This filiation is offspring to your comment that,
     with regard to your putative method of reduction:

     | MW:  Where I come from this method would
     |      be informally known as reification.

JA:  Having seen more of your elaboration of what you are actually doing,
     I begin to see this more as a matter of two kinds of embedding that
     you are carrying out on the given relation, and one of these brands
     of embedding, extension, or extenuation does bear a relation to the
     operation that is classically known as "hypostatic abstraction", or
     else as "reification".  But all of these operations act to increase
     the arity of the relation, so I really do not see how they help the
     case that you want to establish.  I have sorted out these questions
     for separate discussion in this note.

JA:  Concreteness in the beginning is hardly misplaced,
     so let us consider a discreetly simple example of
     a relational database, just to pick one at random
     from off the grainy strand beneath our feet, here:

JA:  Relation L(&amp;) = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x &amp; y = z}.

     o-----o-----o---------o
     |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
     o-----o-----o---------o
     |  0  |  0  |    0    |
     |  0  |  1  |    0    |
     |  1  |  0  |    0    |
     |  1  |  1  |    1    |
     o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  There are many different ways to embed a k-adic relational table
     in a more spacious and sumptious table, that is, one that enjoys
     either more rows or more columns or both, and with whatever form
     of extenutaion is chosen to extend the relation thus represented
     either to larger samples of its initial cartesian product domain,
     or else to relations of augmented audacity, arete, or valoration.

JA:  But you have already instanced for me the two most common types
     of embedding or extension, and so it is meet that we take these
     up first.  Let us just contemplate their basic forms all in one
     place, and leave off discussing the details to later in the day.

JA:  Extension 1.  Abstract Hypostasy, Reflective Entitlement.

     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    t    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  0  |  0  |    0    |
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  0  |  1  |    0    |
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  1  |  0  |    0    |
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  1  |  1  |    1    |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  Extension 2.  Indexing, Keying, Ordering, Sequencing.

     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    n    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    1    |  0  |  0  |    0    |
     |    2    |  0  |  1  |    0    |
     |    3    |  1  |  0  |    0    |
     |    4    |  1  |  1  |    1    |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  Some of the names, of course, are not yet standard.

MW:  In the interests of clarity, this can be seen as an
     intermediate step in the transformation I am making.

MW:  Having introduced the index (the reification step) ...

Gasp!

MW:  then each of the components of each row is related to that index.
     This gives you a basis for creating a relation for each column, so:

MW:  n  = {1,2,3,4}

     x = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,0&gt;, &lt;3,1&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}

     y = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,1&gt;, &lt;3,0&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}

     z = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,0&gt;, &lt;3,0&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}

MW:  I fail to see why you think x, y, z are not relations.
     I have swopped 1 tradic relation for 3 dyadic relations
     plus a set.

Unhuh, and are these three 2-adic relations
just hanging out there, blowing in the wind,
as if they were to wash up on the shores of
your certainty, each one a detached message,
all dispersed in welters of many-splintered
brands and colors of bottles, that the wine
darks seas of the world give up to you, and
you, on receipt of this gift, how would you
even know that each message had any bearing
on the meaning of the others, if not by way
of some clue that you can persieve or purse
seine or just plain abdeuce to be contained
therein, read between the letters and lines?
And are these characters, in their pedigree,
any kind'o'kin to the gang'o'four you hinge
them on, or do they hang but separately, as
nothing but instances of one dummy variable
after'n'other?

MW:  It is relatively straight forward to do the
     transformation in each direction, so they
     are equivalent.

Not so.

You must remember this:
A set is still a set,
as the index goes by.

Consider an "indexed 3-adic relation",
which is really this 4-adic relation:

o---------o-----o-----o---------o
|    n    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o---------o-----o-----o---------o
|    1    |  1  |  1  |    1    |
|    2    |  1  |  0  |    0    |
|    3    |  0  |  1  |    0    |
|    4    |  0  |  0  |    0    |
o---------o-----o-----o---------o

This is a distinct 4-adic relation that might
well arise in any number of applications from
what is fundamentally the same 3-adic relation.
Indeed, there are 4! = 24 distinct such 4-adics
that may easily arise in one setting or another
out of the same 3-adic relation that we had in
the beginning.  So the mapping is not 1 to 1,
but 1 to 24, and this does not make for any
kind of invertible transformation, nor any
kind of equivalence between formal objects.

You have come to the very threshold of teridentity, my friend.

| You tell him to come in sit down
| But something makes you turn around
| The door is open you can't close your shelter
| You try the handle of the road
| It opens do not be afraid
| It's you my love, you who are the stranger
| It is you my love, you who are the stranger.
|
| Leonard Cohen, 'The Stranger Song'
