&gt; Jon,

&gt; I like your explanation:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  "Matthew"  is a sign that denotes Matthew   (in the real world).
&gt; &gt;  "x"        is a sign that denotes x         (in the real world).
&gt; &gt;  "&lt;x, y&gt;"   is a sign that denotes &lt;x, y&gt;    (in the real world).
&gt; &gt;  "R"        is a sign that denotes {&lt;x, y&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; in R} (ITRW).
&gt; &gt; '"Matthew"' is a sign that denotes "Matthew" (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; '"x"'       is a sign that denotes "x"       (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; '"&lt;x, y&gt;"'  is a sign that denotes "&lt;x, y&gt;"  (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; '"R"'       is a sign that denotes "R"       (in the real world).  &lt;&lt;--&lt;&lt; [corrected]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There's a pattern here.
&gt; 
&gt; My only addition is a suggestion that we use KIF
&gt; as the base language of signs for the purpose of
&gt; the SUO, and we define the terms in other languages,
&gt; such as English, conceptual graphs, etc., by their
&gt; translation to KIF.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I repeat my earlier caveat:  This proposal does
&gt; not solve any philosophical problems, it doesn't answer
&gt; any linguistic questions, and it makes no claim that KIF
&gt; is the best language for everything that one might want
&gt; to use a language for.  But it allows the work on the
&gt; SUO to proceed.

John,

KIF, in the shape that we currently know it, and, for that matter,
most of the popular systems for expressing FOL, are not languages
that I can think in, for the reason that they preclude me, either
through their deliberate inexpressiveness or their computational
inefficiency, from being able to address the research issues that
are of pressing concern and present interest to me, like whether
the functional (procedural) and the logical (declarative) aspects
of computational (in the broadest sense) languages can be better
integrated than they currently are, just to name a single issue
that leaps to mind.  Why would I want to be a part of building
a language that I myself would not use, could not use for any
significant purpose under the sun?  Why would I want to sell
to others, to impose on others, a language that they will
have so much trouble, with mechanized help or otherwise,
using to think?

I never know where any language might be capable of going over time,
and so the only features that I see worth criticizing in FOL or KIF
are the features that would keep them cast in stone, fixed in place,
or rooted to the spots that they currently inhabit.  Folks said that
they were interested in feedback -- and that gave me sufficient hope,
way back in the beginning, that I contributed the bit of stuff that
I learned over thirty years of working in the sub-basement of logic,
but "I get no takers".  I suspect that I have become one more victim
of that human, all too human "Paradox Of Social Axiology" (POSA), the
one where people say:   "Well, if somebody is trying to give it to us
for free, it must be either (1) worthless, (2) a disease, or (3) both".
Another one of those things that will kill any try at open collaboration.

And so it goes,

Jon Awbrey

P.S.

Oh yes, I already know the comeback.  I have written a few peculiar bits
here and there, so that must be the reason.  But I have written many more
absolutely boringly non-comically straight bits all over the place, which
you may notice get, comparatively speaking, next to nothing like the same
level of attention.  Why is that?  Because some local authority says that
it's wrong?  Is that the method of inquiry?  There is a way to find out
if a given statement is wrong.  Even the Ancients, who had no science,
or logic, or brains, or anything knew a little bit about it.  Or you
could bet that we would not be here to be trashing their knowledge,
that is, if you are given to existential proofs.

J.A.
