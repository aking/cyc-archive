Dear John and Pat,

I wouldn't want to get in the way of a good arguement but ...

&gt; However, we
&gt; have been engaged in an interminable war about how the
&gt; formalisms are related to the world.  

My experience is that when - shall we say - discussions get to this point, a
useful strategy can be to try to understand why you are BOTH right. It works
for me.

Otherwise your suggestions John seem very sensible.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; Pat and I usually agree on mathematical and logical issues
&gt; and the terminology used to talk about them.  However, we
&gt; have been engaged in an interminable war about how the
&gt; formalisms are related to the world.  At the moment, we
&gt; are in the middle of a truce, which we agreed upon in order
&gt; to get on with the task of defining the foundations of KIF
&gt; and CGs.
&gt; 
&gt; At the risk of disturbing that truce, I would like to make
&gt; a comment that illustrates exactly where our disagreement lies.
&gt; The philosophical difference between Pat and me is illustrated
&gt; by the following diagram:
&gt; 
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A>
&gt; 
&gt; On the left is the world, which Pat and I agree exists.
&gt; On the right is a theory, about which Pat and I usually
&gt; agree.  In the middle is a model of some aspect of the world.
&gt; 
&gt; The difference between us is that I maintain that it is much
&gt; more convenient to treat models as abstract constructions
&gt; that have a mapping to whatever aspects of the world that we
&gt; may be interested in studying, talking about, planning for, etc.
&gt; Pat, however, maintains that "a Tarski-style model" is or
&gt; should be constructed out of actual entities in the world, not
&gt; just pointers to or surrogates of entities.
&gt; 
&gt; The truce consists in our agreeing that both kinds of models
&gt; can be isomorphic to one another, and for purely mathematical
&gt; discussions, there is no distinguishable difference between
&gt; a model made up of "real-world entities" or a model made up
&gt; of "pointers" or "surrogates".  There is, however, a difference
&gt; in the kinds of natural language comments that one might make
&gt; about those models and the kinds of metalevel reasoning that
&gt; one might use in relating models to the world.
&gt; 
&gt; Some comments on your comments:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;2. I ( and maybe others like Graham Horn) rightly or wrongly 
&gt; feel it ought
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;to be possible to have a formal language and explanations 
&gt; which are easier
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;to understand and to easier to interpret than much of what 
&gt; we see written
&gt; &gt;by mathematicians as referring to the real world.
&gt; 
&gt; I definitely agree.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;....  Furthermore, within IT, the word Relation is
&gt; &gt;strongly associated with what I believe is a correct but 
&gt; relatively limited
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;application of the mathematical concept propounded by Ted 
&gt; Codd, viz. the
&gt; &gt;use and manipulation of tables of constant surrogates 
&gt; (?grounded tuples).
&gt; 
&gt; Pat's major complaint about that view is that it limits
&gt; the theory to finite tables.  I think that we can all agree
&gt; to use the IT view, provided that we generalize the word
&gt; to admit arbitrarily large (possibly uncountable) tables.
&gt; Then the word "table" becomes a convenient synonym for
&gt; "extension of a relation", and IT people can visualize them
&gt; as printable displays while mathematicians are free to consider
&gt; infinite tables in their formalism.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I will raise another potential hazard.  The way the word  
&gt; Model is used in
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;mathematics can appear to be the exact inverse of its 
&gt; natural language
&gt; &gt;meaning.  In natural language if I say A is a model of B, it 
&gt; is B that is
&gt; &gt;the real thing, the building, aircraft, or whatever.  I understand
&gt; &gt;mathematicians to refer to some reality as a model of the 
&gt; mathematical
&gt; &gt;theory.  I don't wish to spend time arguing this, but 
&gt; suggest noting the
&gt; &gt;risk.
&gt; 
&gt; Carl Adam Petri (of Petri-net fame) made exactly that point
&gt; about 30 years ago, and he argued for something very close
&gt; to my mthworld.gif picture.  Since Carl, Pat, and I have all
&gt; been trained as mathematicians, it is misleading to say that
&gt; the disagreement is between mathematicians and IT people.
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestion:  To bring an end to this endless e-mail debate,
&gt; I recommend the following compromise:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. When talking about the semantic foundations of a formal
&gt;     language, such as KIF or CGs, we discuss the methods of
&gt;     evaluating the truth of a statement in terms of a model
&gt;     without worrying about what the bottom-level elements of
&gt;     the model may happen to be.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. When talking about how predicates or relations in KIF
&gt;     are mapped to "real world" entities, we can discuss the
&gt;     problems of measurement and experimental error by talking
&gt;     about syntactic features of the language and about the
&gt;     methods of mapping them to the world without using the
&gt;     word "model".
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Whenever it does become necessary to talk about models
&gt;     and the world in the same breath, we can use the terms
&gt;     "abstract model" for what I talk about when I use the
&gt;     word "model" and "concrete model" for what Pat means
&gt;     when he uses the word "model".
