PS = Paul Simon

david, i see that some confusion below is due to purely orthographic considerations.
peirce gives a &quot;careful&quot; (= excruciatingly meticulous) discussion at the beginning
of his paper as to what typefaces he will use for what discriminating purposes,
but the editors of CP and CE apparently disagreed about what was &quot;Kennerly&quot;
and what was &quot;Madisonian&quot;, so I will just revert forward to the convention
of modern mathematical monography and use 'italics' (= single quotes) for
formal symbols in text.  here is a cleaned-up copy of the text in view:

&quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic&quot;

| In reference to the doctrine of individuals, two distinctions should be borne in mind.
| The logical atom, or term not capable of logical division, must be one of which every
| predicate may be universally affirmed or denied.  For, let 'A' be such a term.  Then,
| if it is neither true that all 'A' is 'X' nor that no 'A' is 'X', it must be true that
| some 'A' is 'X' and some 'A' is not 'X';  and therefore 'A' may be divided into 'A' that
| is 'X' and 'A' that is not 'X', which is contrary to its nature as a logical atom.  Such
| a term can be realized neither in thought nor in sense.  Not in sense, because our organs
| of sense are special -- the eye, for example, not immediately informing us of taste, so
| that an image on the retina is indeterminate in respect to sweetness and non-sweetness.
| When I see a thing, I do not see that it is not sweet, nor do I see that it is sweet;
| and therefore what I see is capable of logical division into the sweet and the not sweet.
| It is customary to assume that visual images are absolutely determinate in respect to color,
| but even this may be doubted.  I know of no facts which prove that there is never the least
| vagueness in the immediate sensation.   In thought, an absolutely determinate term cannot
| be realized, because, not being given by sense, such a concept would have to be formed by
| synthesis, and there would be no end to the synthesis because there is no limit to the
| number of possible predicates.  A logical atom, then, like a point in space, would
| involve for its precise determination an endless process.  We can only say, in a
| general way, that a term, however determinate, may be made more determinate still,
| but not that it can be made absolutely determinate.  Such a term as &quot;the second
| Philip of Macedon&quot; is still capable of logical division -- into Philip drunk and
| Philip sober, for example;  but we call it individual because that which is denoted
| by it is in only one place at one time.  It is a term not 'absolutely' indivisible,
| but indivisible as long as we neglect differences of time and the differences which
| accompany them.  Such differences we habitually disregard in the logical division of
| substances.  In the division of relations, etc., we do not, of course, disregard these
| differences, but we disregard some others.  There is nothing to prevent almost any sort
| of difference from being conventionally neglected in some discourse, and if 'I' be a term
| which in consequence of such neglect becomes indivisible in that discourse, we have in that
| discourse,
|
| ['I'] = 1.
|
| This distinction between the absolutely indivisible and that which is one in number from
| a particular point of view is shadowed forth in the two words 'individual' ('to atomon')
| and 'singular' ('to kath ekaston');  but as those who have used the word 'individual'
| have not been aware that absolute individuality is merely ideal, it has come to be
| used in a more general sense.  (CP 3.93, CE 2, 389-390).

JA: david, you have called back to mind a number of loose threads
    on the subject of quant calc that i cannot elaborate too much
    at the moment but only try to collect them in one place again,
    and maybe tie them to a title that i can find again in future.

JA: exhibit 1.

PS: &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic&quot;

CP: | In reference to the doctrine of individuals, two distinctions
    | should be borne in mind.  The logical atom, or term not capable
    | of logical division, must be one of which every predicate may be
    | universally affirmed or denied.  For, let 'A' be such a term.
    | Then, if it is neither true that all 'A' is 'X' nor that
    | no 'A' is 'X', it must be true that some 'A' is 'X' and
    | some 'A' is not 'X';  and therefore 'A' may be divided
    | into 'A' that is 'X' and 'A' that is not 'X', which is
    | contrary to its nature as a logical atom.

DW: ok first off, if A is a term, it is a unit of syntax.
    then when you talk of 'all A is X' or you talk of 'some A is not X'
    I think you are mixing up syntax and semantics.

see orthographic excuses above.

DW: because A as a term can refer to individuals in the world.
    (Are these called particulars?) and it is those individuals
    that are X or not X.  the 'all' and 'some' quantifiers must
    semantically be referring to those individuals.

i will just say how i currently understand the issues here, and
leave it to another time to decide whether I am orthodox or not.

what things are, and the wise in what we wot them to be,
are often wrested apart, the one from the other, if not,
as is likely, or not, the latter being wrong altogether.

so there may be atomic individuals -- let's say there are --
it hardly matters, since our saying so does not give us
one whit more power to know them more particularly than
we actually do.

DW: This is in contrast to the use of quantifiers as syntax.
    In terms of syntax, I'm not sure how 'some' comes into play.
    but 'there exists' is like an infinite OR connective
    and 'for all' is like an infinite AND connective.

better to say &quot;indefinite&quot; than &quot;infinite&quot;, but okay.

DW: since both AND and OR can connect truth-valued terms to make a new term,
    it is reasonable to allow 'there exists' and 'for all' to do so as well.

look, it's 1870.  quantifiers of the brand you describe are not invented yet.
in time you may come to understand why i read that statement very analogous
to saying &quot;crack of the potency that you demand has not hit the streets yet&quot;.

peirce has a better idea here, one that makes quantifiers
look like a derivative, de-based, or trivial afterthought.
with respect to its &quot;functionality&quot; the progress of logic
is all downhill from here.  but i am thoroughly cognizant
of just how hard some habits of thought will be to break,
so i will have to defer the detox to a still future time.

DW: 'some' as a connective doesn't make sense to me, as there is no
    way to talk about the truth value of a term made up using 'some'.

DW: Unless you increase your truth-universe to include a bigger range of values,
    and as an exercise in formalizing, I'm not sure what the much more complicated
    world would gain you.

CP: | Such a term can be realized neither in thought nor in sense.
    | Not in sense, because our organs of sense are special -- the
    | eye, for example, not immediately informing us of taste, so
    | that an image on the retina is indeterminate in respect to
    | sweetness and non-sweetness.  When I see a thing, I do not
    | see that it is not sweet, nor do I see that it is sweet;
    | and therefore what I see is capable of logical division
    | into the sweet and the not sweet.  It is customary to
    | assume that visual images are absolutely determinate
    | in respect to color, but even this may be doubted.
    | I know of no facts which prove that there is never
    | the least vagueness in the immediate sensation.

DW: ok.  using senses as a discriminator is not appropriate.
    terms exist in the 'mind's eye' so to speak.  Senses can
    be used to discriminate the individuals we just talked of.
    in a way of thinking, senses are a way of making real the
    X spoken of before, as they help sort the some A into X
    and not X.  Again, the process of formalizing seems
    inextricably tied to the idea of quantizing.
    The only question is what your quantum are.

you must understand that our primitive ancestors,
way back in the 19th century before they had logic
or science or anything, had a much more &quot;con-fused&quot;
way of connecting the &quot;data of the senses&quot; (DOTS)
with lines of their rhapsodically poetic writs,
and so peirce's dim notions of semiosis would
scarcely have endowed him with the resolving
power that it would take to see, much less
to draw such fine distinctions between
sense and sense as you detect here.

CP: | In thought, an absolutely determinate term cannot be realized,
    | because, not being given by sense, such a concept would have
    | to be formed by synthesis, and there would be no end to the
    | synthesis because there is no limit to the number of
    | possible predicates.

DW: If a term is not 'realized' == 'made real' in thought,
    then where can it be realized?  And while there is no limit
    to the number of possible predicates, the whole POINT of the
    standard upper ontology is to try to come up with a limited,
    useful set, with clear definitions, useful for this synthesis.

look, it's 1870.  peirce discovered a thing he calls &quot;information theory&quot;
just barely five years ago.  that puts him only about 136 years ahead of
most folks today -- in or out of the suo group.

what peirce is saying is that an &quot;absolutely determinate term&quot;,
qua &quot;absolutely determinate term&quot;, is not realized anywhere,
not for fallible and mortal finite information creatures
like us.  if suo thinks that it needs them to work,
then suo is sorely confused about what works.

a finitary logical system may give us &quot;individual names&quot; -- but --
it will not give us &quot;names of individuals&quot;, not in any true sense.

CP: | A logical atom, then, like a point in space, would involve for its precise
    | determination an endless process.  We can only say, in a general way, that
    | a term, however determinate, may be made more determinate still, but not
    | that it can be made absolutely determinate.  Such a term as &quot;the second
    | Philip of Macedon&quot; is still capable of logical division -- into Philip
    | drunk and Philip sober, for example;  but we call it individual because
    | that which is denoted by it is in only one place at one time.  It is
    | a term not 'absolutely' indivisible, but indivisible as long as we
    | neglect differences of time and the differences which accompany them.
    | Such differences we habitually disregard in the logical division of
    | substances.

DW: Agreed, logical formalization is a continuing process,
    involving careful differentiation and axioms to well
    define exactly what is being stated.  We're humans,
    and not machines.

would it help to be a machine?  not if it's finitary.

DW: Again, I think there is a confusing on words here.  'term' is typically
    a syntax word, and the discrimination discussed is semantic discrimination.

it is a style of precision that we have lately lost,
but there is no confusion in what he is saying here.

DW: Isn't the point of modules being discussed previously that
    each way of distinguishing each group and ignoring other
    differences implicitly defines a module?

I am afraid -- Dave -- that I do not grok this use of &quot;modules&quot;.

CP: | In the division of relations, etc., we do not, of course,
    | disregard these differences, but we disregard some others.
    | There is nothing to prevent almost any sort of difference
    | from being conventionally neglected in some discourse, and
    | if 'I' be a term which in consequence of such neglect becomes
    | indivisible in that discourse, we have in that discourse,
    |
    | ['I'] = 1.

DW: Ah, some confusing algebra that means absolutely nothing.

i can but heartily recommend the original paper at this point.
peirce has just now dropped a hint that is utterly remarkable:
that the matter of individuality is an interpretive parameter,
not an absolute, essential, invariant, objective, universal
feature of some supposed ding an sich.  fear and trembling.

DW: Is [] an array? is it a set of values? is it a set of instances that
    can all be grouped because the term I describes them?  Is it a count
    of the letters in a string?  Is the equal sign showing a equality of
    balance where both are the same?  Is it an assignment?  What does
    this have to do with discourse?  etc.

it's an excerpt.

CP: | This distinction between the absolutely indivisible and
    | that which is one in number from a particular point of view
    | is shadowed forth in the two words 'individual' ('to atomon')
    | and 'singular' ('to kath ekaston');  but as those who have
    | used the word 'individual' have not been aware that absolute
    | individuality is merely ideal, it has come to be used in
    | a more general sense.  (CP 3.93, CE 2, 389-390).

JA: Note on the square bracket notation that was used above.
    Peirce explains this notation at CP 3.65, cf: CE 2, 366.

CP: | I propose to denote the number of a logical term by
    | enclosing the term in square brackets, thus, ['t'].

JA: The &quot;number&quot; of an absolute term, as in the case of 'I',
    is defined as the number of individuals that it denotes.

DW: cool.  I wish I had understood this more the first time I read it.
    So ['I'] = 1 is roughly size_of(denoted_set_of (I)) equals 1.

DW: Not a totally unreasonable notation, but not one that I would have easily guessed.
    Does it even make sense to say that there any term that denotes an absolutely
    indivisible group of individuals?

we can still used the con-cept &quot;individual&quot; with con-viction,
even after its rehabilitation, but its debt to society takes
on a different status thereafter.

DW: They are individuals, right? so you can individuate them, right?
    so you can tell them apart.  So if there a a group of them, that
    means you have decided not to tell them apart.  You can give
    a name to any group, even if it is longwinded like

    TheGroupOfIndividualDustParticlesThatLandedOnMyHeadOn13-Dec-2001

DW: but now that I have decided to name that Group,
    it is indivisible as far as that name is concerned.
    If I bring another name into play that interacts with
    that name, then I can divide that group easily.  I would
    expect the interest of the Standard Upper Ontology would be
    to provide a pre-selected list of names and definitions that
    allow that dividing up process to be possible for computers.

|'Collected Papers' (CP 3.45-149), 'Chronological Edition' (CE 2, 359-429).

DW: This stuff is interesting, but how can we leverage this insight
    into a way to describe the world formally to a computer so it
    can use it in an ontology?

DW: 1)  We've said that we can name things.                  -- nothing new
    2)  We've said names divide up the world.                -- nothing new
    3)  We've said sensory perceptions divide up the world.  -- nothing new
    4)  We've said names can be connected to make terms      -- nothing new
    5)  We've said there are syntactic quantifiers           -- nothing new
    6)  We've said there are semantic quantifiers            -- nothing new

DW: So this was delightful, and all, but what did this post
    help us clarify in the process of formalizing ontologies?

it just goes to show that news is in the eye of the reporter, i guess.
