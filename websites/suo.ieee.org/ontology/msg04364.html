LMU.  Note 4

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

There is a little more background material that I ought to fill in,
but I am going to make an initial attempt to paint the Big Picture,
and try to explain in broad terms why I think that Peirce's remarks
on &quot;Limited Mark Universes&quot; (LMU's) are so significant, and how they
anticipate many ideas that I personally did not encounter until the
mid 1980's, in two different fields, cognitive psychology and the
area that is known as &quot;category theory applied to computation&quot;.

I am beginning to get a better understanding of the ways that different
thinkers differ in their thinking processes.  Peirce was what I think of
as an &quot;exploratory heuristic&quot; (EH) and a &quot;3-adic relational&quot; (3R) thinker.
Thinkers of this sort, a category to which I aspire to aggrandize myself
one day, think in very different ways from those that I am coming to
recognize as &quot;absolute dichotomous&quot; (AD) thinkers.

For example, you can forget all that guff about classifying
languages into &quot;extensional&quot; versus &quot;intensional&quot; brands,
and making some 'auto da fe' to one or the other article
of faith.  All the real languages that anybody really
uses in reality have names for things that can be
instances or properties in relation to suitable
other things, not to mention, but they do,
names for these relations themselves.
This is so whether we are talking
logic, math, or normal people.

I think that I will begin from what is closest to me, a problem that
I worked on all through the 1980's, one of the hot topics in AI and
cognitive science at the time, namely, &quot;language acquisition&quot; (LA).
You may remember the analogies that Chomsky pointed out, time and
again, between the problem of &quot;giving a rule to abduction&quot; and
the &quot;poverty of the stimulus&quot; argument for rational grammars,
that is to say, cartesian rationalism and innate grammars.

A large part of the work that I did on this problem reduced me
to working on computational models of formal language learning,
where the formal languages that I could handle from the outset
were very &quot;impoverished&quot; in comparison to natural languages,
but still not entirely trivial, and with many interesting
facets that would repay even a minimalist treatment.

To make a decade-long story as short as I can make it,
here are some of the ideas that gradually worked their
way into my probable density as I errored and trialed:

1.  Although it initially looks like a problem of classical induction,
    that is to say, forming rules from facts and cases, it turned out
    that I could not detach this from more abductive, anticipatory,
    or hypothetical forms of concept formation.

2.  Instead of just the extensions and the intensions of concepts
    (I had not yet clued into comprehensions at that time), there
    was another sort of relation between data and concepts that
    I was forced to consider, on account of what many call the
    &quot;generative property&quot; of any non-trivial language, or what
    is just about the same thing, the circumstance that the
    language learner, by the very nature of the task, does
    not have the whole extension of a language or any of
    its grammatical categories, but at every stage of
    the game has only a finite experiential record
    of the instances that fall under the putative,
    contingent, and ever hypothetical, concepts.

This last aspect of the problem led me to recognize the importance of the
sampling relation, which reminded me, via some vague or vagrant memory,
of Aristotle's &quot;enumerative induction&quot;, and so I came to call this
relation between the data and the concept the &quot;enumeration&quot; of
the concept, and extension and intension makes three.

Have to break here ...
