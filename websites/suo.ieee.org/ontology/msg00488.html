I agree John Sowa's suggestion is a good one.  The words Relation and
Relationship have been used in different contexts by different people which
make it quite clear they are attaching incompatible meanings.  For example,
many of the contexts in which Matthew West has used Relation are not
compatible with Ted Codd's definition.   To eliminate these conflicting
uses sufficiently will probably require more detail than John gave, and
comment on several of the responses.

I don't have time now to treat the subject to this depth, but I will just
comment on the suggestion that Relation and Relationship are synonymous.  I
disagree with John Velman that John Sowa's discussion supports the
conclusion that they are synonymous.  I recommend strongly that we do
distinguish them (which I know from long past experience may be
particularly difficult for French speakers because that language only has
the word Relation but not Relationship).  I suggest there are at least
three importantly different (but closely related!) concepts we may wish to
refer to at different times:

1. A generic relationship concept (e.g. Customer), sometimes called
relationship type

2. A specific instance of a relationship concept (e.g. Martin King is a
customer of Singapore Airlines)

3. A population of relationship instances (e.g. all customers of Singapore
Airlines), close to the concept of class

I believe Ted Codd's use of Relation clearly corresponds with 3.  In
natural language, Relationship often means 1. and often means 2. and most
of the time it is so obvious from the context which it means, that neither
the utterer nor the interpreter realises there is any potential ambiguity.
In natural language it is possible to choose to always qualify Relationship
as Relationship type or Relationship instance, but this gets so clumsy most
of the time we don't.  Only when we get into more precise languages do we
find the problem and struggle to resolve it.

Bottom line is I recommend we use Relation as Ted Codd and John Sowa
suggest, and Relationship for 1. and 2., defining qualified terms if we
find this essential.  French and English both have the word Association,
which I find a very acceptable synonym for Relationship; this may assist
some French speakers.

Yours, Martin

John's suggestion is a good one.    However, whether
"relation" and "relationship" are to be synonymous seems to
be left open.    It seems to me that we should read them
synonymously (a conclusion based both on John's discussion and
my prior vunderstanding).  As WordWeb says:

"('relationship' is often used where 'relation' would serve (as in "the
relationship between inflation and unemployment")) preferred usage
of 'relationship' is for human relations or states of relatedness."

 It seems that in logic, math, and database talk we often use
"relationship" where "relation" would serve just to make our prose less
boring.

Another issue that was raised in the prior correspondence
is the question of "what is a  predicate (or relation)" versus what is
an entity or thing.   There was some discussion of reification earlier
(that I didn't read because...).      I don't know a simple way to
explain this --- as a mathematician (or at least a former mathematician)
I don't think I need a 'real' explanation, just some rules to operate
by.   Nonetheless, when converting natural language statements into
FOL, there can be a lot of confusion, and more than one way to do it.
The fact that many predicates and events have names that are
related in natural language makes  explaining the difference more
difficult.     For example,  (at least in one possible ontology )   "wet"
(as in "the street is wet from the rain") is a predicate, while
"the wetting of the street" describes a "wetting" event whose
"patient" is "the street", That is, "wetting" is  a thing, while "wet" is
a predicate.   (Yes, it was raining when I drove to work this morning.)

I recently read a paper on deontic logic that made significant use of
mapping back and forth between the domain of quantification (the wetting
of the street) and the available predicates (the wetness of the street),
but,
unfortunately, I can't find the reference right now.

Best,

John Velman

Graham and Pat,

To avoid endless problems caused by mismatched definitions,
I suggest that we adopt the following equivalences between
terms:

 1. The terms "relation" and "relationship" in ordinary
    English have multiple meanings.  But the use in both
    symbolic logic and in relational databases is firmly
    established.  I recommend that we restrict all uses
    of those two words to the meanings in logic and RDBMS.

 2. In RDB, a relation is defined by a table.  The number
    of columns in the table is critical:  a binary or dyadic
    relation has two columns, a ternary or triadic relation
    has three columns, etc.  Each row of the table is
    called a tuple or a relationship.

 3. In ordinary language, a relationship (row of a table)
    normally relates two or more entities.  But for generality,
    it is convenient to allow tables with just one column.
    To avoid saying that a one-column table defines a relation,
    some people prefer to call them properties or attributes.

 4. In logic, the terms predicate and relation are normally
    used as synonyms.  For those people who feel uneasy about
    calling a one-column table a relation, one could say that
    it defines a monadic or unary predicate.  Then the term
    predicate can be used to represent tables with 1 or more
    columns.

 5. The terms property and attribute tend to get very confusing
    and people keep arguing about whether attributes are
    entities.  To avoid such arguments, it is best to use a
    single word such as predicate, with an additional adjective
    to specify the number of arguments:  monadic, dyadic,
    triadic, or n-adic, if you count in Greek; or unary,
    binary, ternary, or n-ary, if you count in Latin.

Many people have different preferences in their use of
terminology, and I don't want to limit anybody's stylistic
preferences.  But for ease of communication, I would recommend
that we use the word "predicate" with a qualifier to specify
the number of arguments as the base term.  To visualize the
values of a predicate, you can think of it as a table in an
RDBMS (but with the option of having infinitely many rows, in
the case of predicates defined over the integers or even the
real numbers).

The words "property" and "attribute" have been used in many
confusing ways.  I suggest that we use them only as synonyms
for monadic (or unary) predicate.

John Sowa
