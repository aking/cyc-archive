BA = Bill Andersen
JA = Jon Awbrey

BA: That's SCIENCE, not ENGINEERING.  Engineers just build.  Look at the Segway.

JA: Segue?

BA: No, the Segway -- the little gyrostabilized electric
    two-wheeler that you can drive around on sidewalks.

Okay, I remember seeing that on Nova or the News -- just didn't catch the name.

JA: You can't possibly mean the things you just said here.
 
BA: For the purposes of building an ontology system (or systems),
    there is only one necessary condition:  that the logic be able
    to do any computation we can do on our current von Neumann-style
    digital computers.  Anything less, and we lose the ability to
    choose the point in the expressivness-efficiency space in
    which we'd like a given ontology to operate.

BA: Well, perhaps there should be more necessary conditions.
    But I have named one at least and I encourage others to name more --
    perhaps this is where we all should have started out on this list.

Your remarks sent me back to H.A. Simon's AutoBio and 'The Sciences of the Artificial',
and sure he had things to say about the foibles of thinking Engin reduces to Physics,
but I am not talking about some hard/soft/ball game between Big Engin &amp; Big Science.
I am talking about the pervasive need for critical thinking &amp; problem-solving under
uncertainty skills that everybody needs just to commute to work much less succeed
when they get there.  And I have followed enough of the hertz paradigm shifters,
first in medical education and then in engineering education to know that I am
not the only one.

JA: The question was:  How to design a better theorem-trap,
    one that is somewhat higher up in the efficiency space?

BA: Jon, I fear you may have some important point here -- please speak plainly.
    Are you saying that we should favor ATP approaches that are by some standard
    more efficient (and less complete) than unrestricted resolution?

JA: I am talking about the practical conditions
    for practical success in applying logic.

BA: So am I.

JA: And yet it seems that many people are blocked in their critical reasoning
    by one or another equally facile identification of their preferred syntax
    for tackling their sublunary logical chores with Pure Reason Its Own Self.
 
JA: That just means:  It's hard to improve something that you think is perfect.
    But any person who thinks that FOL is GOL, in any of their secular avatars,
    is a finitely informed critter with a serious awareness-of-fallibility gap.

BA: Don't jump to conclusions.

Ipse dixit.

BA:  If you were actively working with people in the field
     who are IMPLEMENTING ontology software rather than just
     talking about it, you would not find the love affair with
     pure FOL that you imagine exists.

I am not the one who called FOL &quot;God's Own Logic&quot; (GOL).

BA: However, I think John Sowa (and others)
    have the right idea -- that FOL has
    pretty much all the power you need
    to say what you want.

A remark like this is just off the wall.
FOL has no computational &quot;power&quot; at all.
It has the expressive &quot;capacity&quot; of one
very big, very empty bucket, so what?
Nobody who proves theorems for their
living could literally survive in
this formalism, much less in some
gawdawful straitjacket like KIF.
Everybody who knows bo diddley
knows this.

BA: Using that as a basis, you can then choose
    how you want to make computational compromises.

This is not called compromise.
This is called closing the barn door
after the horses have flown the coop.

BA:  In my view, the problem with languages like DAML/OIL
     is that the computational compromises are built in --
     fine for an implementation language to be used for
     a special application, but completely undesirable
     as an ontology authoring language.

And this is &quot;Calling The Kettle Hollow&quot;.

BA: It would make my life simpler (I don't have time to read a screed) if you
    would just say what features you think a logic for ontology ought to have.
    If you take this on, please try and use standard mathematical vocabulary.
    I for one would like to see what you have in mind.

I started working on my first CSP-GSB inspired theorem prover in 1972,
working in one of the early string-processing languages called Snobol,
as a project for course in mathematical linguistics.  I continued this
work in 1975, using what was then a newfangled notion, a programmable
text editor.  Stuff I did on my lunch hour and when nobody was looking.
Didn't get serious about moto-math again until 1980, after some years
as a math grad, and I started having conjectures that I really needed
to settle.  Wrote initial trials in UT Lisp until somebody somewhere
wrote an article that said AI was dead, that some SysAdminBot thought
justified dumping Lisp off our mainframe.  Luckily (?) PC revolution
was getting into gear so I started converting all my Lisp code into
UCSD Pascal on a TI-99-4A.  It was all that I could afford to buy --
they were having a closeout sale at Toys-R-Us, so I got a lot of
it dirt cheap.  By 1984, I was working in Turbo Pascal and had
already begun to abandon the proof-theoretic methods that were
de rigeur when I started for a more model-theoretic approach.
Found myself in ChamBana in 1985 taking a course from Plaisted
on &quot;general resolution-unification mechanized math&quot; and did an
independent study to continue working on my Peircean notions.
Horn clause logic was considered a joke then and still is by
just about anybody who is serious about mathematical work.
I gradually realized that GRU methods would never cut it,
and I started throwing more weight toward &quot;equational&quot; as
opposed to &quot;implicational&quot; methods that leak information.
Back at Michigan in 1986, my logic program, called &quot;Slate&quot;,
proved its first theorem without any help from its mother.
By 1989, I had been able to integrate my language learner
and my logical modeler together well enough to submit as
a &quot;Plan B&quot; thesis substitute and get another Master's
out of it.  Had to start writing the documentation,
which required me to relearn English, that I had
somehow lost the ability to write in during the
previous decade of living and breathing in code.
End Of Screed.

Jon Awbrey
