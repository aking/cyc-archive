Howard,

I am going to start by gathering together for comparative study
the various sorts of epistemic diagrams that we have been using,
plus those that I otherwise know about, that might conceivably
bear on this problem of building machine tools to support the
intellect, derricks or drilling platforms for exploration,
if you will, or frameworks and instruments for inquiry.

Let us start with your rendition of Hertz's modeling relation:

|   External Objects _____ We Form For Ourselves _____ Images or Symbols, Pictures
|         |                                          / [Signs, Brain States, Whatever]
|         |                                         /                  |
|         |                                        /                   |
|   [Natural Laws]          . . . Such That . . . /    [Logic, Mathematical Model]
|         |                /                                           |
|         |               /                                            |
|         |              /                                             |
|   Naturally Necessary /___ Are The Same As The _____ Logically Necessary
|   Consequents                                        Consequents Of The Model

HH: | We form for ourselves images or symbols of external objects;
    | and the form which we give them is such that the logically
    | necessary (denknotwendigen) consequents of the images in
    | thought are always the images of the necessary natural
    | (naturnotwendigen) consequents of the thing pictured.
    |
    | For our purpose it is not necessary that they [the images] should be
    | in conformity with the [external] things in any other respect whatever.
    | As a matter of fact, we do not know, nor have we any means of knowing,
    | whether our conception of things [our models] are in conformity with
    | them [external things] in any other than this one fundamental respect.
    |
    | H. Hertz (1857-1894),
    |'The Principles of Mechanics', Dover, NY, 1984, pp. 1-2;
    | orig. German ed., 'Prinzipien Mechanik', 1894.

Abstracting a bit from the finer details, we have a commutative diagram of sorts:

|                             We Form For Ourselves
|       External Object  o----------------------------&gt;o  Image or Symbol in Thought,
|                        |                            /|  Conception of the Object
|                        |                           / |
|                        |                          /  |
|        [Natural Laws]  |   . . . Such That . . . /   |  [Logic + Mathematical Model]
|                        |  /                          |
|                        | /                           |
|   Naturally Necessary  v/                            v  Logically Necessary
|   Consequents Of The   o----------------------------&gt;o  Consequents Of The
|   Thing Pictured             Are The Same As The        Model

The more that I stare at this picture the more that I start to recognize it.
It is the very way that I used to explain to my students when I taught math
what the paradigmatic genre commonly known as &quot;The Art of the Story Problem&quot;
is all about.  More than that, remembering this has given me a clue to what
some of our difficulties over Formalismism might be about.  So looky here:

|                        Problem Formalization
|    Story Problem  o----------------------------&gt;o  Formula Problem
|                   .  (Abduction, Abstraction)   |
|                   .                             |
|                   .                             |
|                   .  (Deduction, Explication) = |  Formula Cranking
|                   .                             |
|                   .                             |
|                   v (Induction, Interpretation) v
|   Story Solution  o&lt;----------------------------o  Formula Solution
|                       Probational Application

For the sake of comprehensiveness, I have added in parentheses a number of
presently salient terms, but certainly not ones that I would have employed
in the mixed company of an undergraduate audience.

A few notes on this picture are in order:

1.  What it illustrates is simply the following familiar process:

    a.  Starting with an informal, narrative, practical, or &quot;story&quot; problem.
    b.  Recognizing the story as a possible case under a rule or a &quot;formula&quot;.
    c.  Deriving from the formula a canonical solution, an answer in &quot;theory&quot;.
    d.  Warily interpreting the theoretical solution for the practical setting.

2.  Although this process is based on a commutative diagram,
    the directed trace of the process takes the final arrow
    in a sense opposite to the &quot;initial formulation&quot; arrow.

3.  It is terribly important to impress on ourselves the circumstance
    that only certain sections of this problem solving process can be
    reduced to rote, that is, delivered over to automatic habits and
    unreflective routines, whether of humans or of machines.  Indeed,
    only the decadenza of deductive, explicative, syntactic argument
    has the reasonable facsimile of any guarantee along these lines.

4.  In particular, because the formulation arrow typically casts off
    such a large degree of detail in the casual setting of the story,
    the return interpretation arrow will of necessity have to supply
    the lack on the way back to the scene of the initial application.
    Because it is possible to guess wrong and to make errors at each
    and every stage of this process, non-essentially so in deduction
    but essentially and thus ineliminably so on the horizontal steps,
    the &quot;final&quot; attempt at applying the &quot;formal&quot; solution can hardly
    ever be considered truly final, but must be tested by common wit
    and against the full details of the original pragmatic situation.

5.  Imagine how silly it would be if some people were to imagine that
    the horizontal arrows could be altogether cast out of our quivers,
    but then, strangely enough, I've heard tell that &quot;some people&quot; do.

Enough for now,

Jon Awbrey

JA: ... it is mostly the task of constructing software tools for the
    support and extension of our humane intellects that is my main aim. 

HP: Creating machine tools to support the intellect is an aim worthy of discussion.
    Where in the course of inquiry, using any epistemic diagram you choose, do you
    feel the inquiring mind needs the most help?  Or is it more modest to ask where
    we could expect technically plausible software (and hardware) to help the most?

JA: Here are some of the big problems that I see here:

JA: There is a field of activity, transected by several shifty lines:

    1.a.  &lt;What people can do&gt;      Versus  1.b.  &lt;What people cannot do&gt;
    2.a.  &lt;What people do best&gt;     Versus  2.b.  &lt;What people do not do best&gt;
    3.a.  &lt;What people like to do&gt;  Versus  3.b.  &lt;What people do not like to do&gt;

JA: The uses of technology worth having are those take some of the stuff that humans can do --
    goodly, badly, or indifferently -- but out of which people no longer get much of a kick,
    and shift these fardels so that machines will bear them.

JA: I am pretty much content to leave the creative stuff to people for a while,
    since I have no clue how to automate it, and even if I did I would have to
    ask whether it's creative stuff we like or creative stuff we dislike doing.

JA: The thing is that many activities of interest to us are cyclic or recurring processes,
    and this means that we can often facilitate the whole cycle simply by identifying the
    places where things are pinched a bit more than others, the points of high resistance --
    no, there is no venturi flow here, it's a high viscosity current so far as I can tell --
    and by loosening up these bottlenecks to whatever extent that we can.  Still, not all
    of the bottlenecks are ones that we can do much about, so we have to pick our bottles.

JA: In view of these things, I am mostly focused on the barriers, blocks, boondoggles,
    bottlenecks, briar patches, broken fields, bulwarks, caltrops, hurdles, obstacles,
    obstructions, ramparts, rough spots, sandtraps, and walls that we keep on running
    into as we try to move forward in our evolving inquiry.  Whenever I run into one
    of these blocks I have to backtrack to a point in our common intellectual orbit
    where I can see the nature of the obstruction well enough to see a way around,
    beyond, or through it.

JA: Notice that this sort of work is often very different from trying to build imitation humans
    or anything like that.  In fact, though it is probably useless to tilt against the windmill
    of a mere name like &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (AI), my roots go back to the classical angle
    of Ashby and others that initially disposed them to build an &quot;intellectual amplifier&quot; (IA).

WRA: | If this is so, and as we know that power of selection can be amplified,
     | it seems to follow that intellectual power, like physical power, can be
     | amplified.  Let no one say that it cannot be done, for the gene-patterns
     | do it every time they form a brain that grows up to be something better
     | than the gene-pattern could have specified in detail.  What is new is
     | that we can now do it synthetically, consciously, deliberately.

JA: On To The Epigenetic Algorithm!
