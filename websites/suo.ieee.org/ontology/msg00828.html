Jim,

If it is not too late, I will cast a vote to Abstain. :-)

I am more persuaded by the arguments that I have seen for No than for Yes
(though I cannot say I've seen all or even most of the arguments -- the
volume of email correspondence exceeds my ability to read most of it.)

I'm concerned that the requirements for the ontology may not be well
defined, and agreed enough at this point to successfully adopt something as
a working draft. It might be better for efforts like Ian Nile's to be
welcomed as "strawmen" to help identify issues and requirements, and perhaps
also contribute potential elements for future incorporation into a working
draft.

Even so, it is appropriate for me to Abstain rather than to vote No, for the
following reasons:

1) I missed the deadline to vote (my fault).

2) I won't have the time to actively participate in much of the construction
of the SUO -- I will need to be mostly just an interested observer. So it
would not be appropriate for me to cast a vote that might stand in the way
of others who are committing more time to the construction of SUO.

If the distinguished majority voting Yes wish to proceed, and believe they
can be successful, after duly considering the comments of the distinguished
minority, then I am glad to cheer them on, and wish them every success.

Sincerely,

Phil Jackson

&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 18, 2001 7:03 AM
&gt; To: Standard-Upper-Ontology (E-mail)
&gt; Subject: SUO: Revised Call for Vote on Merged Ontology
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; SUO Participants,
&gt;
&gt; 1. Since the prior vote had a variety of problems, it is amended
&gt; as follows
&gt; to focus on the key question.
&gt;
&gt; 2. If you have already cast a vote (and received acknowledgement)
&gt; you don't
&gt; need to vote again, unless you wish to change your vote or comments.
&gt; However, this is an open list and all are welcome to post or repost their
&gt; opinions.
&gt;
&gt; 3. This message is a call for a vote on the question:
&gt;
&gt; 	Should the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology Working Group
&gt; 	commence work on the Merged Ontology as posted by
&gt; 	Ian Niles with the intent of attempting to develop
&gt; 	it into a final standards document?
&gt;
&gt; 4. Background:  If this vote passes, this document will change from being
&gt; the work (and under the control) of a group of individuals to
&gt; being the work
&gt; (and under the control) of the SUO WG.  A Technical Editor will need to be
&gt; appointed or elected, who will need group approval before making changes.
&gt; This does not require frequent formal votes for every change. A better
&gt; approach for daily or weekly updates is to develop consensus by resolving
&gt; objections, as we did when revising the Scope and Purpose.  In
&gt; other words,
&gt; the editor posts a suggested change and asks for any objections.
&gt; Items that
&gt; do not have clear consensus would be accumulated.  Then, every 3-6 months
&gt; the group could have a formal vote on what would be the next 'Working
&gt; Draft.' Comments would be submitted and resolved before approval
&gt; as the next
&gt; Working Draft.
&gt;
&gt; 5. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of consensus we have
&gt; for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need to
&gt; decide if we
&gt; are going to go down this path or not.  A working group may decide to work
&gt; on more than one document, so anyone else is free to submit one.
&gt;
&gt; 6. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose improvements to the
&gt; document, unless they are major enough for you to vote against
&gt; focusing work
&gt; on this document.  However, such general improvement comments are welcome
&gt; and will be resolved (but not unless and until the vote passes.
&gt; There would
&gt; be no sense in resolving comments if the group does not want to
&gt; proceed with
&gt; this document.).
&gt;
&gt; 7. Since we are still in the process of establishing official
&gt; voting rights,
&gt; I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw poll, such that
&gt; anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if consensus is not
&gt; clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote (once voting
&gt; rights are established).
&gt;
&gt; 8. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), NO (comments
&gt; required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt;
&gt; 9. You may send your votes either to me or to this reflector.
&gt;
&gt; 10. Please vote by Feb 1, 2001.
&gt;
&gt; Jim Schoening
&gt; Chair, SUO WG
