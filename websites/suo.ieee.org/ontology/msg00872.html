&gt; Subject: On the relevance of EXPRESS, EPISTLE, etc. to SUO -- RE: RE:
&gt; RE: Some Procedural Suggestions
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; First let me say that it is not enough to thank you for clarifying the
&gt; record -- on further thought it is clear that I should apologize for
&gt; suggesting that you (or anyone) proposed EXPRESS as an 
&gt; alternative to KIF,
&gt; when you did not do so. I am sorry for this error.

MW: not a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Having said that, I would like to make the suggestion that 
&gt; the SUO group
&gt; should compare the representational features of EXPRESS with 
&gt; KIF, to decide
&gt; whether EXPRESS may in fact be a better starting point for 
&gt; representation of
&gt; SUO. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each language?

MW: Well, before anyone expends too much effort on this exercise, perhaps I
should say that one of the reasons I am here is a dissatisfaction with
EXPRESS. We have already started developing a language called EXIST
(EXpression if Information based on logic and Set Theory) to address some of
these issues. We had originally rejected KIF as being just too difficult to
understand. EXIST is not as clear as some ACE would be, but I do think it is
easier to understand than KIF.

MW: EXPRESS is an entity relationship language, which is intended to define
data structures, rather than axioms, although it has an extensive constraint
specification language. Overall it is a very extensive language, with
roughly the same capability as the static part of the UML, for those
familiar with it. This complexity is one of the issues, plus some of the
basic limitations of the entity relationship paradigm. When you want to
design a system to implement an ontology, EXPRESS is a good choice (so an
EXPRESS model of KIF could be useful).
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I would like to make the suggestion that the SUO group 
&gt; should consider
&gt; leveraging EPISTLE and other models already developed in EXPRESS as a
&gt; starting point for developing SUO.

MW: This is a better idea. The EPISTLE Core Model is designed to be a
foundation that can integrate a range of ontologies (or data models). It is
not perfect, but it is the current result of some 15 years concerted effort
by a range of people.

MW: Many of the other models in SC4 are also useful, but in general more
specialised. So when you want to know how to make a 3D geometric
representation of something, or incorporate a piece part product catalogue,
we probably have what you need.

MW: It is worth pointing out that the representation of information about
something, which seems to exercise so many people here, is rather well
understood and taken for granted.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me there could be some promise in both these efforts. For
&gt; example, you have written that the following concepts 
&gt; recently listed by Pat
&gt; Hayes could probably fit into EPISTLE:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; an 'information-bearing object' (see my long comment in a
&gt; &gt; recent message);
&gt; &gt; a piece of a certain kind of cloth which was used in evidence
&gt; &gt; in a trial;
&gt; &gt; the color of that piece of cloth;
&gt; &gt; the act of breaking an egg by hitting it on the side of a bowl;
&gt; &gt; a style of dress used by a certain social class in
&gt; &gt; 17th-century France;
&gt; &gt; the shape of Marilyn Monroe's left ankle;
&gt; &gt; the cause of the Concorde disaster;
&gt; &gt; a dish (in the sense that Eggs Benedict is a dish, ie a something
&gt; &gt; that could be a menu item; as opposed to any particular example of
&gt; &gt; that dish, or the symbols on the menu describing it.)

MW: Yes. I still have to respond to Adam's request for how they fit.
&gt; 
&gt; EXPRESS, EPISTLE and the other models developed in EXPRESS, have the
&gt; advantage of having been developed over several years by many 
&gt; people in an
&gt; open, standards-based effort.

MW: One of the key things we can bring is experience of developing standards
in this area. The SUO does not have to suffer all the mistakes that we
managed to make.

&gt; My understanding is that they 
&gt; are publicly
&gt; available standards, which could be leveraged by SUO. Their 
&gt; development has
&gt; also been focused on practical, industry-based applications 
&gt; which may be
&gt; consonant with SUO's objectives. For all of these reasons, 
&gt; plus the general
&gt; expressiveness of EXPRESS, they may be better starting points 
&gt; and long term
&gt; approaches than either of the current alternatives, which 
&gt; seem to be: a)
&gt; starting with a relatively new "merged ontology" developed in 
&gt; KIF; b) going
&gt; with CYC, if a suitable copyright release letter can be obtained.

MW: I think the reality is that there are a number of starting points, each
of which is valuable in its own right. What I think we need to do is take
some time to understand these, and see how we candraw from each of them in
the most appropriate way. At the least they each represent some requirements
we need to address.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Philip,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Below you suggest that EXPRESS has been proposed as an
&gt; &gt; alternative to KIF.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This can only be supposed to come from me, so in case others
&gt; &gt; &gt; think this too,
&gt; &gt; &gt; let me say plainly that I do not propose EXPRESS as an
&gt; &gt; alternative to KIF
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the purpose of developing an SUO. It happens I have some
&gt; &gt; &gt; useful content
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is defined in EXPRESS, and I think it is useful to 
&gt; expose people to
&gt; &gt; &gt; content in a "foreign" language so they can understand how
&gt; &gt; difficult it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; for those of us who are not native KIF speakers to read and
&gt; &gt; write KIF, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is all.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jim, and all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Once again I will jump into the fray with a few comments and
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestions for
&gt; &gt; &gt; how to proceed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that SUO has been making progress, yet three
&gt; &gt; central issues
&gt; &gt; &gt; are unresolved:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) What are the objectives for use of the SUO?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) What are the requirements for the SUO?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What are the requirements for the language(s) in which the
&gt; &gt; SUO will be
&gt; &gt; &gt; represented?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Before we can decide what language to use we need to agree on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements for the language. The requirements for the
&gt; &gt; language depend on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the requirements for the SUO, which depend on the objectives
&gt; &gt; for the SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Much of the discussion in SUO seems to involve these issues while
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to
&gt; &gt; &gt; make progress on theoretical questions related to the SUO 
&gt; itself. There
&gt; &gt; &gt; needs to be a consensus on these issues before people can agree
&gt; &gt; about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; value of any proposed candidate for the SUO, or any proposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; elements of an
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUO, though efforts such as Ian Niles' "merged ontology" 
&gt; are valuable at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least as strawmen to help identify issues.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The objectives of the SUO are addressed briefly at the 
&gt; SUO website, in
&gt; &gt; &gt; sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, though questions
&gt; &gt; still arise
&gt; &gt; &gt; about the objectives.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sections
&gt; &gt; &gt; on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there are 
&gt; questions that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; unresolved about the requirements. E.g. the Scope discussion says
&gt; &gt; &gt; "an upper
&gt; &gt; &gt; ontology is limited to concepts that are meta, generic, 
&gt; abstract and
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether the 
&gt; ontology should
&gt; &gt; &gt; include "semiotic concepts" or should only include things 
&gt; that "really
&gt; &gt; &gt; exist" in the world.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The SUO website lists KIF or the simplified version as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; proposed language
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the standard, without giving a discussion of the
&gt; &gt; requirements for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; language. We have proposals for alternative languages (e.g.
&gt; &gt; EXPRESS), and
&gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing discussions about some of the requirements for the
&gt; &gt; language. E.g.
&gt; &gt; &gt; does the language need to include reflection, does it 
&gt; need to represent
&gt; &gt; &gt; semiotic concepts, does it need to be a programming language?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Which elements
&gt; &gt; &gt; of an SUO should be built into the language, and which should
&gt; &gt; be expressed
&gt; &gt; &gt; using the language? Does it need to be a higher-order language or
&gt; &gt; &gt; should SUO
&gt; &gt; &gt; be expressed at the level of first order predicate calculus, etc.?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many such questions have already been addressed at one time or
&gt; &gt; another in
&gt; &gt; &gt; email threads among the participants. Yet it appears that there
&gt; &gt; &gt; is no way to
&gt; &gt; &gt; determine what has been resolved or agreed about these
&gt; &gt; questions (and what
&gt; &gt; &gt; is still unresolved) without reviewing all the email
&gt; &gt; correspondence, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; is not practical.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; To address these issues, I recommend that the SUO 
&gt; participants take a
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard software engineering approach, and collaborate on
&gt; &gt; development of
&gt; &gt; &gt; concise yet complete requirements specifications for the 
&gt; SUO and for its
&gt; &gt; &gt; language.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; These requirements specifications should be located on the SUO
&gt; &gt; &gt; web site and
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be working documents that are iteratively developed,
&gt; &gt; starting with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the current statements of scope and purpose. I'd 
&gt; recommend that these
&gt; &gt; &gt; specifications be presented in a "requirements outline" format,
&gt; &gt; where each
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirement or issue is very concisely stated in a single 
&gt; sentence, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; sub-requirements and issues are added as the group develops them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hyperlinks could be used to give more complete discussions of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements, issues and resolutions, with pointers to the email
&gt; &gt; &gt; correspondence about them. We may need to have votes 
&gt; about specific
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements, to resolve their status.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The precise format of the requirements outline is not 
&gt; important, but it
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be something that is very concise yet complete. E.g.,
&gt; &gt; &gt; something like
&gt; &gt; &gt; the indented table of contents outline for a standard FAQ would
&gt; &gt; be useful.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, email correspondence could try to follow a standard 
&gt; of having the
&gt; &gt; &gt; specific requirement or issue identified in the email 
&gt; subject line, in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard way, so that people can easily see which requirements
&gt; &gt; and issues
&gt; &gt; &gt; are being discussed, find other relevant email, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, it is clear that there are distinct differences of
&gt; &gt; opinion among
&gt; &gt; &gt; the participants about the answers to questions related to
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements for
&gt; &gt; &gt; the SUO and its language. Indeed, questions about requirements are
&gt; &gt; &gt; "inevitably intertwined"* with theoretical questions about the
&gt; &gt; design and
&gt; &gt; &gt; implementation of the ontology, and with theoretical 
&gt; questions about
&gt; &gt; &gt; ontology and knowledge representation in general. On some of
&gt; &gt; &gt; these questions
&gt; &gt; &gt; we may not reach consensus, and the SUO effort may need 
&gt; to "fork" and
&gt; &gt; &gt; explore alternative answers. This would allow progress to 
&gt; be made on
&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple paths when it is not clear to everyone which is the
&gt; &gt; best path to
&gt; &gt; &gt; pursue.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
