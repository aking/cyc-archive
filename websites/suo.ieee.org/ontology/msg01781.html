&gt;Reasons Why The English Language Is Hard To Learn:  &lt;Or why phonics won't
&gt;teach how to read it all&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;Here are the classics. 
&gt;
&gt;1) The bandage was wound around the wound. 
&gt;2) The farm was used to produce produce. 
&gt;3) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse. 
&gt;4) We must polish the Polish furniture.  &lt;The char staff at the State
&gt;Department used to get mad at the Eastern European director who left a sign

&gt;ordering  them to POLISH one particular desk every night.&gt;
&gt;5) He could lead if he would get the lead out. 
&gt;6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert. 
&gt;7) Since there is no time like the present, he thought it was 
&gt;time to present the present. 
&gt;8) A bass was painted on the head of the bass drum. 
&gt;9) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes. 
&gt;10) I did not object to the object. 
&gt;11) The insurance was invalid for the invalid. 
&gt;12) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row. 
&gt;13) They were too close to the door to close it. 
&gt;14) The buck does funny things when the does are present. 
&gt;15) A seamstress and a sewer fell down into a sewer line. 
&gt;16) To help with planting, the farmer taught his sow to sow. 
&gt;17) The wind was too strong to wind the sail. 
&gt;18) After a number of injections my jaw got number. 
&gt;19) Upon seeing the tear in the painting I shed a tear. 
&gt;20) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests. 
&gt;21) How can I intimate this to my most intimate friend? 

Other languages have a simple solution to such problems:
accents and umlauts.

German and English have similar systems of sound changes
in verb tenses and in nouns derived from verbs.  The German
speakers solved their problem by adding "umlauts" (literally
"sound changes") represented by two dots above the vowel.

Russian has many words with different meanings that differ
in accent, but not in the traditional spelling.  An example
is the word "sorok" meaning "forty" and the word "soroka"
meaning "magpie".  The genitive plural of "soroka" is "sorok".
If you wanted to write "forty magpies" in Russian, you could
write "sorok sorok", in which the first word has the accent
on the first syllable, and the second word has the accent on
the second syllable.

In Russian, accents are not normally printed in most
publications, but they are written in books for students
and nonnative speakers.

Suggestion:  Adopt a policy similar to Russian, and print
accents and umlauts on texts written for beginners and
nonnative English speakers.  Since the great majority of
everything written today is written on a computer, it would
be possible to have a menu with two options:

 1. Print or display with accents.

 2. Print or display without accents.

Even for old texts that were written long before anyone thought
of using accents, it is possible to use parsers that can
determine the correct placement of the accent or umlaut in
the great majority of cases (including most of the examples
above).  In cases that are truly ambiguous, a word processor
could simply insert an accent in red, which the author could
accept or change, if desired.
