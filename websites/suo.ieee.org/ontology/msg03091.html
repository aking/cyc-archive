Howard,

A little friday night musing ...
not to be taken too serially ...

&gt; 
&gt; Life began with pattern recognition.

And here I thought it was pattern replication ...
I am sure there is a connection somwhere, but ...
what?

Pattern recognition was the problem that first piqued my interest in AI --
excuse me while I wax nostalgic -- Minsky &amp; Papert made me believe that
it could be done right, if a bit harder than anyone had guessed --
I was shocked to find out twenty years later they had gotten
the blame for killing the angels, when all this time I had
believed that they were the messengers.  Strange but true.

&gt; All living organisms are pattern recognizers and are controlled by pattern recognizers
&gt; (i.e., enzymes).  The most fundamental distinction in physics is between things that
&gt; change and things that do not change.  This is a primitive distinction common to all
&gt; organisms with sensorimotor controls that to survive must detect objects (patterns
&gt; that do not change) and the relative motion of objects (patterns that change).

Yes, Wiener, McCulloch &amp; Pitts, Arbib -- the apperception and action apropos
universals and invariants -- my first brush with combinatorial logic, groups,
and the theory of computability, all in one fell swoop in Arbib's little book.

&gt; All brains have special pattern recognizers for each, coupled to motor controls.

Ashby:

| What is it that survives, over the ages?  Not the individual organism,
| but certain peculiarly well compounded gene-patterns, particularly those
| that lead to the production of an individual that carries the gene-pattern
| well protected within itself, and that, within the span of one generation,
| can look after itself.
|
| What this means is that those gene-patterns are specially likely
| to survive (and therefore to exist today) that cause to grow,
| between themselves and the dangerous world, some more or less
| elaborate mechanism for defence.  So the genes in 'Testudo'
| cause the growth of a shell;  and the genes in 'Homo' cause
| the growth of a brain.  (Ashby, 'Intro. Cybernetics' 10/5).

JA had written, in the margin, so many years ago:

| brain, skin, shell -&gt; ectoderm
|
| cortex, cork, bark -&gt; epi-\
|                            &gt; Derm
| keratin, horn, ... -&gt; exo-/

Brain as Shell -- it explains a lot!

&gt; Physics has just refined and formalized (i.e.,
&gt; symbolically represented) this distinction.
&gt; Things that change are called &quot;observers&quot;
&gt; and &quot;initial conditions&quot;, ...

I call these &quot;boundaries&quot;.

&gt; ... things that do not change are called
&gt; the laws of change (i.e., &quot;laws of motion&quot;) and the
&gt; fundamental patterns (i.e., &quot;fundamental particles&quot;).

I call these &quot;interiors&quot;.

&gt; Hertz's epistemological condition and limitation hold at all levels.
&gt; Organisms form images (or models) of external patterns;
&gt; and the form which they give them is such that the
&gt; consequents of the images are always the images
&gt; of the necessary natural consequents
&gt; of the patterns pictured.

It hertz me to have to say it,
But I'm afraid that I observe
A defect in the picture given.
Arrows of logical implication
And arrows of cause to effect
Need not of necessity commute
These all too convenient ways.

&gt; As a matter of fact, organisms do not know, nor have they any means of knowing,
&gt; whether their images or models of external patterns are in conformity with them
&gt; in any other than this one fundamental respect.

I worry a little about that.

Okay, a lot.

Jon Awbrey
