Dear John,

The real problem with relationship and relation is that they are frequently
used both to refer to classes and instances.

For example, when we talk about the lines on entity relationship diagrams,
we call them relationships (perhaps more properly a class of relationship)
yet we also talk about my marriage to my wife as a relationship (occurance).

In logic I notice that the more experienced tend to use "relation" for what
would be a class, or predicate, and not the occurances of it. It is not
clear (to me) that there is an established terminology for the occurances.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; John's suggestion is a good one.    However, whether
&gt; "relation" and "relationship" are to be synonymous seems to
&gt; be left open.    It seems to me that we should read them
&gt; synonymously (a conclusion based both on John's discussion and
&gt; my prior vunderstanding).  As WordWeb says:
&gt; 
&gt; "('relationship' is often used where 'relation' would serve 
&gt; (as in "the
&gt; relationship between inflation and unemployment")) preferred usage
&gt; of 'relationship' is for human relations or states of relatedness."
&gt; 
&gt;  It seems that in logic, math, and database talk we often use
&gt; "relationship" where "relation" would serve just to make our 
&gt; prose less
&gt; boring.
&gt; 
&gt; Another issue that was raised in the prior correspondence
&gt; is the question of "what is a  predicate (or relation)" versus what is
&gt; an entity or thing.   There was some discussion of reification earlier
&gt; (that I didn't read because...).      I don't know a simple way to
&gt; explain this --- as a mathematician (or at least a former 
&gt; mathematician)
&gt; I don't think I need a 'real' explanation, just some rules to operate
&gt; by.   Nonetheless, when converting natural language statements into
&gt; FOL, there can be a lot of confusion, and more than one way to do it.
&gt; The fact that many predicates and events have names that are
&gt; related in natural language makes  explaining the difference more
&gt; difficult.     For example,  (at least in one possible 
&gt; ontology )   "wet"
&gt; (as in "the street is wet from the rain") is a predicate, while
&gt; "the wetting of the street" describes a "wetting" event whose
&gt; "patient" is "the street", That is, "wetting" is  a thing, 
&gt; while "wet" is
&gt; a predicate.   (Yes, it was raining when I drove to work this 
&gt; morning.)
&gt; 
&gt; I recently read a paper on deontic logic that made significant use of
&gt; mapping back and forth between the domain of quantification 
&gt; (the wetting
&gt; of the street) and the available predicates (the wetness of 
&gt; the street),
&gt; but,
&gt; unfortunately, I can't find the reference right now.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Graham and Pat,
&gt; 
&gt; To avoid endless problems caused by mismatched definitions,
&gt; I suggest that we adopt the following equivalences between
&gt; terms:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. The terms "relation" and "relationship" in ordinary
&gt;     English have multiple meanings.  But the use in both
&gt;     symbolic logic and in relational databases is firmly
&gt;     established.  I recommend that we restrict all uses
&gt;     of those two words to the meanings in logic and RDBMS.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. In RDB, a relation is defined by a table.  The number
&gt;     of columns in the table is critical:  a binary or dyadic
&gt;     relation has two columns, a ternary or triadic relation
&gt;     has three columns, etc.  Each row of the table is
&gt;     called a tuple or a relationship.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. In ordinary language, a relationship (row of a table)
&gt;     normally relates two or more entities.  But for generality,
&gt;     it is convenient to allow tables with just one column.
&gt;     To avoid saying that a one-column table defines a relation,
&gt;     some people prefer to call them properties or attributes.
&gt; 
&gt;  4. In logic, the terms predicate and relation are normally
&gt;     used as synonyms.  For those people who feel uneasy about
&gt;     calling a one-column table a relation, one could say that
&gt;     it defines a monadic or unary predicate.  Then the term
&gt;     predicate can be used to represent tables with 1 or more
&gt;     columns.
&gt; 
&gt;  5. The terms property and attribute tend to get very confusing
&gt;     and people keep arguing about whether attributes are
&gt;     entities.  To avoid such arguments, it is best to use a
&gt;     single word such as predicate, with an additional adjective
&gt;     to specify the number of arguments:  monadic, dyadic,
&gt;     triadic, or n-adic, if you count in Greek; or unary,
&gt;     binary, ternary, or n-ary, if you count in Latin.
&gt; 
&gt; Many people have different preferences in their use of
&gt; terminology, and I don't want to limit anybody's stylistic
&gt; preferences.  But for ease of communication, I would recommend
&gt; that we use the word "predicate" with a qualifier to specify
&gt; the number of arguments as the base term.  To visualize the
&gt; values of a predicate, you can think of it as a table in an
&gt; RDBMS (but with the option of having infinitely many rows, in
&gt; the case of predicates defined over the integers or even the
&gt; real numbers).
&gt; 
&gt; The words "property" and "attribute" have been used in many
&gt; confusing ways.  I suggest that we use them only as synonyms
&gt; for monadic (or unary) predicate.
&gt; 
&gt; John Sowa
