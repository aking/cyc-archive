BA = Bill Andersen
CM = Chris Menzel
JA = Jon Awbrey

BA: Jon, that's a sweeping claim.  And it deserves some substantiation.
    I've been doing a lot of stuff over my career -- first in AI, and
    for the past seven years doing DB/ontology work, that works quite
    &quot;well&quot; and uses the &quot;broken&quot; syntactic variants of FOL.  I'm not
    the only one.  All database systems in widespread use today are
    in one way or another based on some variant of FOL (of course
    the model theories differ substantially).

JA: No, I was there as these DB systems developed at many sites,
    and in a few of my student jobs I used some of the early ones
    on real funded &quot;large data base&quot; applied research projects.
    In the early days it was utter common knowledge that these
    &quot;Relational Data Base Management Systems&quot; (RDBM's) were
    based on Peirce's &quot;Logic Of Relatives&quot; (LOR).

CM: Which is just a first-order theory, although it seems to
    take on profound significance for you when expressed in
    Peircean Magickal Syntax (PMS).  Have a look at, say,
    Reiter's work on DB theory, relational calculus,
    and relational algebras.

I was not talking about the ontology of how RDB's are catalogued on Olympus --
I was talking about the history of how they came to be known by mere mortals.
Who discovered what and when first is usually considered to have significance
to those of us who have not already transcended our historical embeddedeness,
though I do understand how every generation that comes along tends to regard
&quot;pre-marital sex&quot; (PMS) as its personal discovery.  Most works that I've read
on relational algebras, outside of certain Parthenogenetic Monstrosities, will
pay their respects to Peirce as being one of their paternal suitors -- why do
they bother?  -- it is normally considered to be a service to their readers.

JA: But we are going to have to get a whole lot more concrete as to what
    in the devil we are talking about under the aegis and banner of &quot;FOL&quot;.

JA: Go haul out your 'Principia Mathematica'.  That syntax I will call &quot;PriMat&quot;.
    Sorry for the lack of a brief acronym -- I reserve &quot;PM&quot; for Pragmatic Maxim.

JA: Nobody uses PriMat.  Never did.  Not for real.

CM: You are obviously confusing the ramified theory of types per se with the
    bare syntax of PM.  You are right that virtually no one has ever used
    RTT for any real logic or mathematics.  Indeed, it is a disaster for
    classical mathematics, as you can't prove many central theorems of,
    say, classical analysis.  But the syntax of PM -- for first-order
    stuff anyway -- is roughly just the syntax of standard FOL.

No, I mean the bare syntax that is used in PriMat.
Russell could not even borrow a simple idea like
Peano's Puncts and just take advantage of its
original simplicity, but had to muck up the
system beyond the point of all usability.

JA: I once took a course in mathematical logic from a philosophy department where
    we started with a 1970's upgrade of PriMat, kept in a Zoo for the amusement
    of philosophers, and spent the better part of a semester working our way
    up to proving the PriMat equivalent of &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;.  No joke.  A task
    like that is several orders of magnitude worse than doing the same
    thing on a turing machine.

CM: You obviously missed the point.  The logic of PM -- ramified type theory --
    was a *foundational* exercise, and its point was epistemological, viz., to
    show that the truths of arithmetic are derivable in principle from logic.
    Your comparison with turing machines is apposite.  No one *ever* thought that
    PM would be used to *do* mathematics, any more than anyone ever thought that
    turing machines would be used to do any serious programming.  Turing machines
    give us a clear formal notion of computability;  PM was intended to provide an
    equally clear demarcation of legitimate mathematics (this in response to the
    specter of paradox).  (Note I'm not *defending* PM, just clarifying the point
    that you missed.)

No, this was at a time when that other 'Mathematica' was just gleam in Stephen Wolfram's
ancestor's eye, so I did not accidentally wander into that class because the courses for
Fortran and Cobol were closed.  My whole point in this part of the discussion has been
that pointing to the &quot;foundational adequacy&quot; of any formalism is utterly beside the
points of addressing its conceptual utility and its computational efficiency.

JA: So nobody uses PriMat for any &quot;substantially useful theory routinely applied&quot; (SUTRA).
    But what they do do with their voodoodoo is this:  They import a very &quot;particular&quot;,
    that is to say, a very analytic and atomistic &quot;Philosophy Of Logic&quot; (POL) that once
    got swept through the door along with PriMat, and they wrap that atomizer miasma of
    mist around whatever it is that any sensible ordinary person would use to do the
    actual work.

CM: Rubbish.  Anyone who knows *anything* about FOL knows
    that it is absolutely neutral regarding philosophical
    commitments.  The semantics requires a nonempty set to
    quantify over.  That's it.  Done.  That set can contain
    physical objects, platonic objects, classes, angels, gods,
    and demons, whatever you like to suit your metaphysical
    predilections.

Chris, thank you for saying this.  Now I can keep a pointer to this point,
and the next time that somebody says that nobody ever said this, I'll be
able to point them to who and where it was that somebody nonemptied this
class of claims.  (Yes, there is a whole literative on &quot;logics without
existence assumptions&quot; that I used to worry over, but that's not what
I had in mind this time around.)

Jon Awbrey

JA: And then whatever staged wonder that they manage to perform by means
    of the means that really do the trick, they attribute to the almighty
    mystical powers of this PriMat POL.

CM: You are arguing against a strawman of your own creation.

BA: That said, you may certainly be correct in saying that there is a better
    syntax out there.  But why all the diatribe?  Why not just come out and
    say that's where your concern lies?  It only takes a sentence or two.

JA: I have been doing that here, a sentence or two or three at a time, for two years.

CM: Except that your arguments -- when you give them --
    are utterly uncompelling, except perhaps to the
    True Believers, and have been exposed as such
    on numerous occasions.

BA: I will even grant that to some extent.  But why not just propose some
    alternative that you think will work better rather than directing
    desultory shotgun blasts at FOL?  That would make for much more
    entertaining (and useful) reading for me anyway!

JA: I've been doing that, one alternative at a time, for a lifetime.
    One, FOL itself is not something that you can point a phaser at.
    Two, whenever I point a critique at a concrete detail of syntax,
    folks wrap themselves in banners or cloaks of &quot;abstract ideals&quot;,

CM: Which seems to be your only interpretation of any disagreement with your views.

JA: and disappear from the scene of pragmatic computational reality.

BA: Ironic that you should give this response to Bill, one of the few people working
    in ontology who is actually involved in writing real programs that do something --
    working strongly within the FOL tradition, as it happens.  Bill is simply tiring
    of your endless tirades when they appear to have no concrete upshot, and is
    requesting, kindly, that you provide some evidence to the contrary.
