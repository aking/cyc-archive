&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I too am dismayed by the volume of discussion and the sense that 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;although individual contributors have benefited from the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion, and a rather small group is making progress on an 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ontology, that we're not working together and making collective 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;progress on a standard.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe you should learn from this observation, rather than regretting it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just because we haven't yet found success is no reason to think it 
&gt;&gt;&gt;impossible.  What lesson would you have me learn, and how should 
&gt;&gt;&gt;that lesson follow from the SUO experience?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That there are genuinely divergent and incompatible views on many 
&gt;&gt;ontological issues, and that consensus cannot be achieved by any 
&gt;&gt;simplistic approach of trying to merge or conflate them by simply 
&gt;&gt;inserting them into a single overarching classification. That 
&gt;&gt;reconciliations between divergent views are best achieved by 
&gt;&gt;looking for mutually acceptable mappings between them, rather than 
&gt;&gt;by choosing one over the other.  That a generally useful 
&gt;&gt;ontological classification should be based on an attempt to 
&gt;&gt;discover orthogonal categories from which a useful lattice can be 
&gt;&gt;constructed, rather than on an ad-hoc initial tree, no matter how 
&gt;&gt;carefully based on some philosophical agenda.
&gt;&gt;All of which, by the way, we concluded in 1998 in Heidelberg.
&gt;
&gt;You hold a different opinion than I do and I must assert that it is 
&gt;simply a different opinion, rather than a truth that any reasonable 
&gt;person should learn.  You may be right.  I might be right.  Time 
&gt;will tell.  Some reasonable people came to one conclusion in 
&gt;Heidelberg.  Other reasonable people can hold a different opinion.

No doubt there are reasonable people who think the world is flat. It 
might help, Adam, if *you* could come up with some arguments for 
*your* opinions. So far I havnt seen or heard any.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe that the solution is not improved document management 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or better tools but rather for folks to be specific and concrete 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in developing a formal document expressing their preferred 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;version of an upper ontology.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think it is simply a reflection of a fact of life: people do 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not agree on ontological issues. They never have and they never 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will. Regretting this is like regretting that people speak 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;different languages. My mum is sternly disapproving of the fact 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there there are people on the planet who don't naturally speak 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Queen's English, an attitude that rather reminds me of yours 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;towards the variety displayed on this very list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't you think that a better attitude to this fact might be to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;find a way to utilize it, rather than try to 'solve' the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'problem'?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Not at all.  People disagree when there is reason to do so,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;People disagree for all kinds of reasons. I don't think the 
&gt;&gt;disagreements that have been revealed on the SUO list arise from 
&gt;&gt;any *need* to disagree. They arise from genuinely divergent, often 
&gt;&gt;deeply felt, convictions about the nature of reality, the 
&gt;&gt;appropriate way to describe it, and so on. You seem curiously 
&gt;&gt;unable to appreciate that there even are such differences.
&gt;
&gt;Again, not at all.  I do appreciate that there are many different 
&gt;ways to model general ontologicial issues.  I simply believe that 
&gt;reasonable compromises and agreements can be made.  The motivation 
&gt;is that if people do agree then their software will be able to 
&gt;communicate effectively without the need for translation.  Maybe 
&gt;French is really the best language for communication but English, 
&gt;Spanish and Swahili are all adequate.  If there's a reason to agree 
&gt;on a common language (and my opinion is that there is such a 
&gt;reason), people will agree.

So you say, but it seems to me that all the evidence is against you. 
If this were true, there would in fact be one world lanuage, and 
there isn't; there would be only one data transfer protocol, and one 
paper size, and one domestic voltage, and one kind of plug; and there 
aren't. And the world goes on about its business perfectly able to 
cope with this situation, while you are busily pursuing a fantasy.

&gt;&gt;Maybe it would help if you were to state explicitly what your basic 
&gt;&gt;assumptions are about the SUO and the methodology that you and Ian 
&gt;&gt;are adopting towards creating it. For example, you seem to assume 
&gt;&gt;that all reasonable people can be made to agree, or at least their 
&gt;&gt;axioms can be. Do you think this is correct? (If so, why?)
&gt;
&gt;Yes.  I take Cyc as a reasonable existence proof even though it may 
&gt;be an imperfect one.

But why is Cyc an existence proof? It shows that an upper ontology 
exists (though I note that Lenat holds the upper ontology effort in 
amused contempt, since he considers the UPPER ontology largely 
irrelevant), but not that a universally acceptable upper ontology 
exists. I have tried to use the Cyc ontology and would not find it 
possible to use for any nontrivial reasoning. Do you know of anyone 
outside Cycorp who has used the CYC ontology (as opposed to Cyc 
itself) to do anything useful?

But in any case, I would agree with Bob Spillers that we ought to be 
trying to do better than Cyc. If all we can do is another Cyc then 
what is the point?

&gt; I also think that the way you've characterized Ian's methodology in 
&gt;the sentence below is an oversimplification, and therefore, as a 
&gt;strawman, easy to dismiss as insufficient.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;You sometimes seem to think that just by translating axioms into a 
&gt;&gt;common logical notation, they will somehow come to be mutually 
&gt;&gt;compatible. You seem to think that the exact definitions of the 
&gt;&gt;terms in the concept heirarchy are not all that important, and are 
&gt;&gt;really only hooks to hang things on. Are all these impressions 
&gt;&gt;correct?
&gt;
&gt;no, this is an oversimplification.  There's considerable actually 
&gt;editing and alignment that Ian has done.  The work has not simply 
&gt;been translation into KIF.

It is a simplification, but not I think an OVERsimplification. The 
largest part of what has been done seems to be largely a process of 
translation into KIF. The more pressing problems of conceptual 
alignment havn't been tackled, apparently because you are unable to 
see that they need to be done.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and find ways of agreeing when there is reason to do so.  In the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;KIF working group we have a compelling need to agree on a common 
&gt;&gt;&gt;language and semantics for the language.  We might each have our 
&gt;&gt;&gt;preferences, but we're willing to give up certain preferences here 
&gt;&gt;&gt;and there in order to reach consensus.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, you introduced the example, so let me respond. First, KIF is 
&gt;&gt;a language, not an ontology, so there is lot less to disagree 
&gt;&gt;about. Even in that severely limited domain, and that relatively 
&gt;&gt;small group, we managed to discover at least three basic, 
&gt;&gt;irreconcileable differences in viewpoints, as you may recall. We 
&gt;&gt;have indeed managed to find a route through this particular 
&gt;&gt;minefield, but only with the greatest care and by some of the group 
&gt;&gt;agreeing to bow out of the discussion and leave it to a smaller 
&gt;&gt;subgroup to thrash out the details. And only 2 weeks ago, we 
&gt;&gt;discovered that we had been talking at cross purposes over such a 
&gt;&gt;basic notion as what constitutes a sorted language for the previous 
&gt;&gt;six months, and were obliged to redefine our overall goals as a 
&gt;&gt;result. We once spent several wseeks arguing over the exact from of 
&gt;&gt;the BNF for 'identifiers'. If the KIF group is a microcosm of the 
&gt;&gt;SUO effort, then the SUO is doomed.
&gt;
&gt;Another difference of opinion I think.  In KIF we're creating a 
&gt;foundation and with that foundation in place I think there will be 
&gt;less flexibility for difference on the ontology.

KIF is almost entirely neutral with respect to the ontology: it is 
just a usefully flexible first-order notation. So agreeing on KIF 
doesnt get us anywhere (other than a usefully flat playing field.)

&gt;A great deal of misunderstanding happens I feel because we're 
&gt;talking in ambiguous English.  Once people get to the point of being 
&gt;willing to state theories as formal axioms, I think resolution on 
&gt;many issues will be quicker.

I think you are confusing genuine disagreement about substantive 
issues with the kind of misunderstandings which arise from ambiguity. 
Moving to a formal language does not produce instant clarity, since 
the intended meanings of the formal assertions have to be elucidated 
in order that the formalism can be judged. One could, admittedly, 
take a more rigorously logical line towards this issue, and insist 
that axioms say what they say, regardless of human intentions (a 
position I myself am in sympathy with, as I expect you know.) But 
*that* posiiton requires its own kind of rigor: one would then want 
to see demonstrations of the consistency of the ontology, by actual 
descriptions of models, and some effort made to locate nonstandard 
models (to see the kind of thing I have in mind, take a look at the 
comments on models in my time catalog, which were inspired by Van 
Benthem's work.)

&gt; I also should add that it is the highest levels of the ontology 
&gt;which are the hardest.  I've found progress in practice on 
&gt;application level ontologies to be much faster and so I think we'll 
&gt;see a dramatic acceleration in progress as agreement on upper levels 
&gt;is reached.

Has it not ocurred to you that this may simply be a sign that Lenat 
and Hendler might be right, and that the upper ontology is largely 
irrelevant to the lower ontological levels? At the very least, does 
it not suggest that to get the easier (lower) parts done first ( 
particularly when so many of them are already done in some detail), 
and then to abstract the upper levels from them, might be a useful 
approach, rather than insisting on this top-down methodology? It 
seems kind of obvious to me that it almost impossible to get the 
upper levels right in isolation, and it is harder to do that than to 
abstract them, so why bother?

&gt;&gt;&gt;We don't all need to agree on every aspect of the SUO.  We merely 
&gt;&gt;&gt;need to have a product we can accept as a result of a lot of give 
&gt;&gt;&gt;and take.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The product that Ian is creating will never be acceptable to me, 
&gt;&gt;under any circumstances.
&gt;
&gt;I'd hope that you'd keep a more open mind, and allow the possibility 
&gt;that you've misunderstood the methodology,

If I ever had seen a statement of the methodology I might be inclined 
to take it more seriously. As far as I can tell, you have no 
methodology. You simply have a combination of an amateur's enthusiasm 
and a kind of naive optimism that things will somehow work out 
alright in the end if you just keep slogging away. People have 
criticised Cyc for being ad-hoc, but Doug in fact has always had a 
kind of overall plan in the back of his mind. He kept his secret, but 
I see no reason why you should.

&gt;or that the methodology may turn out to be a reasonable one, or that 
&gt;a flawed methodology might still yield an acceptable result.

For something as complex and difficult as an upper ontology, I would 
think that this is about as likely as a pile of sand and rock turning 
itself into the Taj Mahal.

&gt;&gt;I say this not in any way as a criticism of Ians work, but as a 
&gt;&gt;comment on the overall methodology. I have tried to make my reasons 
&gt;&gt;for this as vividly clear as I possibly can, ever since I first saw 
&gt;&gt;the first draft of the ontology. If you still don't understand them 
&gt;&gt;then I am at a loss as to how to communicate them to you.
&gt;
&gt;I believe I understand your opinion.  I don't find it totally 
&gt;unreasonable.  Jim Hendler seems to have a similar view about the 
&gt;need to have many alternate ontologies.  I respect that view and 
&gt;feel that I can support Jim on his project with work that is 
&gt;consistent with his goals.  However, I disagree with that particular 
&gt;opinion.

But you havent ever explained WHY you disagree with it, or what are 
your grounds for optimism in the face of so much evidence to the 
contrary.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you believe something specific is lacking in the Merged 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ontology that Ian has been working on, suggest a new axiom, or 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;set of terms.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Adam, speaking for myself, the major source of frustration is 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that people do not seem to read what one writes. Have you 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;actually understood anything of what I wrote about what is wrong 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with the overall methodology of Niles' effort? It cannot be cured 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;by adding more bits to it, any more than tossing a few more 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;vegetables into a stew is going to turn it into a souffle.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I've read your comments and I simply don't agree with your 
&gt;&gt;&gt;criticisms.  Maybe I don't yet fully understand them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, if you don't agree with them, maybe you could actually answer 
&gt;&gt;them? Prove me wrong.
&gt;
&gt;Sigh.  We may just have to agree to disagree.  You've given many 
&gt;opinions and asserted them as if they were facts.  I've tried to 
&gt;answer your criticisms and provide justification for my opinions.

Well, sorry, Adam, but in fact this is what you have conspicuously 
failed to do.  Let me give you an example. The merged ontology began 
by taking Sowa's upper ontology as a basic framework (and has since 
greatly simplified and modified it). Why? What was the methodological 
basis for choosing that particular classification as a first step? 
Was it because you felt that John's work reflected the most 
appropriate view of the world? Or was it because it was there, and 
anything would do? Or did you just toss a coin?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If some folks would prefer EXIST or some other basis for the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;standard, then offer concrete extensions to it using the EBNF 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;syntax defined for it.  Formalisms without explanation or 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discussion may make it difficult for some folks to communicate 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but discussion without formalisms will lead us simply to more 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talk.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I would like to applaud those folks who have been very concrete 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(and forgive me for those who I have forgotten): Helena Sofia 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pinto for contributing an ontology of units and measures, Nicola 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Guarino and his colleagues for their work on mereology, Pat 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hayes for his detailed and specific help on temporal axioms, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Chris Menzel, David Whitten and Robert Kent for their work on 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the "structural ontology". We should also thank John Sowa, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Achille Varzi, Roberto Casati, James Allen, Barry Smith, Stuart 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Russell, Peter Norvig and all the unattributed contributors to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the Ontolingua repository.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If everyone on this list would create just some small ontology 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of even a dozen terms supported by axioms that has not yet been 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;covered in the merged ontology, we could make tremendous 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;progress.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No, we would simply have a larger and even more confused stew. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The axiomatizations would be incompatiable with each other and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would be based on sharply different views of the world. Surely 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;this is vividly clear from the postings on this list? Matthew 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;West's axioms would talk of 4-d entities and be based on a solid 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;physical nominalism; Lee Auspitz' axioms would assume a tensed 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ontology and would take human experiences as their basic 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;framework. Others would write axioms which transliterate one of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;several different kinds of English grammatical theory. We even 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seem to disagree on what words like 'set' and 'class' mean.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You have thanked me for my contribution on temporal axioms, but I 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wish you would not, since I regard the temporal axioms in Niles' 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;document as a crock, and would refer that my name not be 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;associated with them. There is no single generally useful 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;axiomatization of time: that is why I wrote a temporal CATALOG, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;setting out the ALTERNATIVES and noting the ways they were 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;INCOMPATIBLE with each other. I did that for a reason, not 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;because I couldnt think of anything else.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;We may disagree on English terms but I'm not clear on which axioms 
&gt;&gt;&gt;you disagree with.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Asking me to disagree with individual axioms is like answering 
&gt;&gt;someone who criticises Windows 98 to cite a particular line of code 
&gt;&gt;they don't like. It just misses the point. Its not that I disagree 
&gt;&gt;with any axioms in particular, but that they disagree with each 
&gt;&gt;other.
&gt;
&gt;Then point out some axioms which disagree with each other.

I already have done, on several occassions. I feel like we are going 
in circles here.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Look, surely it is obvious that one cannot expect, just because 
&gt;&gt;people are using a common logical langauge, that they are 
&gt;&gt;automatically agreeing with each other?
&gt;
&gt;I haven't claimed that.

No; but you act as though you believe this to be approximately true.

&gt;&gt;On what grounds would you *expect* to be able to 'merge' ontologies 
&gt;&gt;written by different people about different subject-matters, with 
&gt;&gt;different philosophical or pragmatic or mathematical agendas, so 
&gt;&gt;that they fit together into one framework? This entire ambition 
&gt;&gt;strikes me as close to insane. Is your experience of the world 
&gt;&gt;really so limited that you have never come across divergent points 
&gt;&gt;of view? I managed to find about 20 or so incompatible points of 
&gt;&gt;view just on temporal orderings.
&gt;
&gt;I've never said that people can't hold different points of view, 
&gt;just that compromise and agreement is possible.

How would you compromise between a view of time which says that time 
is discrete, and view of time which says that time is dense? That is 
like compromising between P and (not P). Yet both views have their 
uses and their adherents. Similarly for space being continuous but 
surfaces being real; for time being linear or branching; for things 
seen as continuants or as processes; for spatial properties seen as 
applying to locations or to things; for temporal properties being 
inherited by subintervals or applied to reference intervals; for 
fluid objects being coextensive with pieces of fluid or not; and so 
on and on and on. Almost everywhere I look at any ontological issue, 
I can see alternative, incompatible but both potentially useful ways 
of describing it.

&gt;&gt;Let me turn the point around. Show me some nontrivial consequence 
&gt;&gt;of the axioms in the merged ontology that you think illustrates its 
&gt;&gt;utility, and that uses axioms from several different sources. Let 
&gt;&gt;me give you an example to get things started: try inferring that if 
&gt;&gt;there is a hole and that some fluid stuff is moving into the hole 
&gt;&gt;and the hole doesn't get smaller, then the stuff must be going 
&gt;&gt;somewhere. That should involve holes, time and fluids, and maybe 
&gt;&gt;pathways.
&gt;
&gt;That's a neat example, and one I'd be happy to work through.  I'm 
&gt;likely to make mistakes the first time around or two since I haven't 
&gt;been working on all the details of the Merged Ontology.

OK, fair enough. I don't know how to do it either.

&gt; Also, you'll have to grant that the Merged Ontology is a work in 
&gt;progress and that even in this example, we're likely to find 
&gt;concepts which are incomplete, underdefined or missing.  I think 
&gt;what we're trying to accomplish with this exercise is to zero in on 
&gt;parts of the ontology that which are somehow incompatible with each 
&gt;other.  Since I think that finding an unsolvable incompatibility is 
&gt;unlikely, I'll hope to have the result that we flesh out some 
&gt;missing concepts which Ian can include in a new version of the 
&gt;ontology.
&gt;
&gt;I'll respond to this in a separate post.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Or take a few combined concepts. Suppose that someone wants to 
&gt;&gt;describe a subclass of human beings, those who are related to a 
&gt;&gt;British citizen in some way that gives them the right of abode in 
&gt;&gt;the UK (a *very* sensitive issue in UK politics, by the way). What 
&gt;&gt;kind of ontological description would be used to describe such a 
&gt;&gt;class? (The legal definition was changed a number of times, so that 
&gt;&gt;the answer is highly connected with the time the request was made. 
&gt;&gt;Just a heads-up about the kind of issues that are going to come 
&gt;&gt;up.) Heres another: the notion of an insult. What *kind* of thing 
&gt;&gt;is an insult? Which hook would you suggest hanging it on? 
&gt;&gt;(Similarly slander/libel/offense/apology...)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, although you've said often that you consider the current 
&gt;&gt;&gt;merged ontology "incoherent" or, as above, that there are sections 
&gt;&gt;&gt;that are "incompatible" with one another, I don't believe you've 
&gt;&gt;&gt;given a precise characterization of what you mean by those words.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I can't give you a LOGICAL definition. What I meant is that various 
&gt;&gt;parts of the ontology are written with different, and incompatible, 
&gt;&gt;assumptions in mind. The 'foralls' in one part of the ontology 
&gt;&gt;range over different universes than those in other parts, for 
&gt;&gt;example. I have already documented several of these cases, but the 
&gt;&gt;point is that with this methodology such clashes are inevitable.
&gt;
&gt;I'd submit that if there isn't a precise logical definition, then 
&gt;what we are arguing about is just the 'incompatibility' of intent of 
&gt;knowledge authors rather than any actual incompatibility of their 
&gt;axioms.  I'd certainly grant that virtually any concept can be 
&gt;fleshed out more and that until axiomatized, it is likely that 
&gt;different authors would have different imprecise intent for their 
&gt;chosen elaborations.

You seem to think that the process of formalization is somehow going 
to iron out the philosophical differences between world-views; that 
while people may differ on the words they use when arguing with each 
other, they will agree on the forms of their axioms. That has not 
been my experience, however: on the contrary, in fact, in spades. The 
process of being exact about axioms reveals all kinds of differences 
between people's mental models which they were previously unaware of. 
I have many amusing anecdotes about this, my favorite being the 
question of whether the paint on the wall of an office is inside the 
office or not.

&gt;&gt;I have another problem with the current merged ontology, which is 
&gt;&gt;that its basic class distinctions don't make sense to me and aren't 
&gt;&gt;properly documented,and seem to form a tree, which is wildly 
&gt;&gt;unsuitable for any complex reasoning. I notice however that you 
&gt;&gt;have a much more casual, ready-to-hand attitude to conceptual 
&gt;&gt;classification than I am comfortable with. You use "Sign", for 
&gt;&gt;example, in ways that would I suspect make a true-born P**rcian 
&gt;&gt;cringe (whatever it is, it is inherently triadic, so classifying a 
&gt;&gt;novel as an instance of Sign has got to be a mistake. Maybe one 
&gt;&gt;particular event of reading a novel might qualify?), although as I 
&gt;&gt;have no idea what it means I am not really qualified to judge. On 
&gt;&gt;the other hand, I will never, to my dying day, use an ontology that 
&gt;&gt;requires me to categorize Hamlet as an instance of Sign.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you mean that the current ontology is logically inconsistent? 
&gt;&gt;&gt;If so, let me issue a friendly challenge: show a proof using the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;axioms in the merged ontology which leads to a contradiction.  Let 
&gt;&gt;&gt;me issue an even stronger challenge since if there are in fact any 
&gt;&gt;&gt;contradictions I suspect we can fix them
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That is like saying that if I find any holes in the airplane you 
&gt;&gt;can patch them.  Even if it were true, it doesnt make for good 
&gt;&gt;engineering.
&gt;
&gt;It's more like saying that while the Wright brothers are building 
&gt;the plane, for the first time, that they can be confident they'll 
&gt;fix any flaws and would appreciate any help in making the plane fly.

I would suggest that before comparing yourself to the Wright brothers 
that you read a history of aviation. The Wrights were excellent 
engineers, and started by doing thorough testing of lift/drag ratios 
of a collection of model airfoils. There was a long tradition of 
building-and-see-it-it-works before then, and most of the pilots 
didn't live long.

&gt;&gt;&gt;: show two proofs leading to contractions for which any fixes 
&gt;&gt;&gt;would generate more contradictions.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This could also include domain-specific ontologies as the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;exercise of linking such ontologies to the merged ontology will 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;elucidate the general areas that need to be developed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about a practical semiotics of books, recordings and documents;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Would it take a book to be a semiotic text with a physical 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;encoding, or a physical object (a continuant or a 4-d lifetime?) 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to which contentful relations can be applied, or a kind of 'sum' 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of a physical entity plus a nonphysical 'text', or a collection 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(what kind of collection?) of surfaces bearing 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;information-encoding marks, or...? (Please don't say 'all of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;these') Some people think of books as things with a history, like 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;old furniture.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;These are exactly the sort of questions the author of an ontology 
&gt;&gt;&gt;of semiotics should ask, and answer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;On what grounds should they be answered one way rather than 
&gt;&gt;another? All are perfectly fine answers, for some purposes. A book 
&gt;&gt;is one thing to a bookbinder, another to a librarian, another to a 
&gt;&gt;publisher, and still another to a copyright lawyer, and yet 
&gt;&gt;something else to a freight line operator. None of them are *right* 
&gt;&gt;and the others *wrong*. They are all perfectly good, but subtly 
&gt;&gt;incompatible, views.
&gt;
&gt;If they're all fine answers then just pick one.  The only problem 
&gt;would be if reasonable choices on different areas of the ontology 
&gt;cause some fundamental incompatibility.  I doubt that will occur and 
&gt;haven't seen any evidence that it will.

Then , in all honesty, you must be sleepwalking. I have given you 
about a dozen examples myself. The territory is littered with 
examples. Almost any choice you make is incompatible with some other 
perfectly good choice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That they have not been answered in this discussion group should 
&gt;&gt;&gt;not suggest that they can't be answered satisfactorily.  Since 
&gt;&gt;&gt;you've asked, let me attempt an answer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Im sure that an answer CAN be given. My point is that other answers 
&gt;&gt;can also be given, and the SUO cannot possibly legislate some out 
&gt;&gt;of court and others in.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'll call on Ian to correct any erroneous connections that I may 
&gt;&gt;&gt;make with the merged ontology (given below as a term with an 
&gt;&gt;&gt;initial capital).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;A book is a physical object with a lifetime - subclass of VariableObject
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Why  Variable?
&gt;
&gt;See <A  HREF="http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;skb=Merge&amp;id=80">http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;skb=Merge&amp;id=80</A>
&gt;"A ContinuousObject whose physical properties may nonetheless vary..."

I get something about socal behavior from this URI, and the browser 
doesnt recognise 'VariableObject'. (??)

&gt;&gt;&gt;A book is related to the "conceptual work" which is the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;information content of the text in the book.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What about encyclopedias, collections of poetry, dictionaries, and diaries?
&gt;
&gt;While it would be good to have more specialized cases of 
&gt;ConceptualWork to cover these items, they still seem to fit at least 
&gt;in the informal English definition I've given above.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;A conceptual work is a ContentBearingObject (it may more 
&gt;&gt;&gt;specifically be a Sign).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think this is wrong, since a ContentBearingObject is a physical 
&gt;&gt;entity which also bears information (last time I checked).
&gt;
&gt;good point
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;A conceptual work has temporal extent, at least one author, and no 
&gt;&gt;&gt;physical extent.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Not all works have authors.
&gt;
&gt;While alternate formalizations are certainly possible and 
&gt;reasonable, what I'm intending (which points to my earlier comment 
&gt;about discussions converging once formalized) is that any such work 
&gt;does have at least one author.  Dictionaries and encyclopaedias have 
&gt;authors.  Were you thinking of a different counterexample?

I was thinking of books that have editors but not authors, such as 
collections of poetry or conference prceedings. Individual poems may 
also be anonymous, by the way.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;A particular coding of the conceptual work is also a Sign.
&gt;&gt;&gt;A book contains a particular coding of the conceptual work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What distinguishes a book from a videotape or a CD?
&gt;
&gt;They'd all be VariableObjects but we'll certainly over time need to 
&gt;develop more specific classes for electronic media which would be 
&gt;further specialized with magnetic media.

You are missing my point. We started out saying what a book was, and 
my point is that the definition suggested for book also covers some 
things that are clearly not books. So the definition is wrong. Adding 
these other concepts does not fix 'book'.

PS. I have been browsing the merged ontology and so far *every single 
thing* I have seen in it is wrong. In particular (in no particular 
order):
1. the axiom for piece-of is obviously wrong, since it entails that 
every piece has all the properties of the whole:
(=&gt; (piece-of ?X ?Y) (forall (?Z) (=&gt; (instance-of ?Y ?Z) 
(instance-of ?X ?Z))))
2. piece-of only applies to ContinuousObjects, which is wrong.
3. OrganicSubstance is a subclass of ContinuousObject, which is 
either wrong or assumes a strongly mereological view of objecthood.
4. The explanation for continuousObject does not make sense. It 
starts "A ContinuousObject is an object in which every part is 
similar to every other in every relevant respect." which is a 
contradiction in itself, since some parts presumably contain other 
parts as parts.
5. Can something be a selfConnectedObject and also a 
ContinuousObject? If so, what is a superficial-part-of a 
ContinuousObject, and if a superficial-part-of is also a part, is it 
similar in every relevant respect to a non-superficial part? If not, 
why is the object Continuous; if so, what makes the part superificial?
6. An action is a subclass of a HumanCaused Process, which makes 
actions by animals, computers and other machines logically impossible.
