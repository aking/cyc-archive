&gt;Dear John,
&gt;
&gt;The real problem with relationship and relation is that they are frequently
&gt;used both to refer to classes and instances.
&gt;
&gt;For example, when we talk about the lines on entity relationship diagrams,
&gt;we call them relationships (perhaps more properly a class of relationship)
&gt;yet we also talk about my marriage to my wife as a relationship (occurance).
&gt;
&gt;In logic I notice that the more experienced tend to use "relation" for what
&gt;would be a class, or predicate, and not the occurances of it. It is not
&gt;clear (to me) that there is an established terminology for the occurances.

Maybe I am blinded by the limitations of a mathematical education, 
but I see no problem here. A relation (let us stick to binary 
predicates for simplicity) such as Married is a set of 2-tuples, ie a 
set of pairs. If a particular pair, such as
&lt;MWest, WifeofMWest&gt;, is in the set of pairs called 'Married', then 
we say that the relation(ship) of being married holds between them, 
or (more colloquially) that they are married. In KIF this would be 
written
(Married MWest WifeofMWest), and it asserts that a relation holds 
between two things, ie that that pair of things is 'in' the relation, 
which in a somewhat different terminology can be phrased as saying 
that the relationship between them is an instance of the Married 
relation.

This last use of "instance" corresponds exactly to the usage for 
unary predicates. A unary predicate is simply a set, and an 
"instance" of it is a member of that set. Thus for example if red is 
the predicate - excuse me, the unary relation - I mean, the property, 
of being red, then something is (an instance of) red just when it is 
a member of that set (of all the red things.). Similarly, two people 
are an instance of Marriage just when, taken together as a pair, they 
are in the corresponding set (of all married couples).

It is important to notice that a particular thing can be in many 
different sets, and a particular pair can be in many different sets 
of pairs. There is a special set which is unique to any given pair, 
which is the set which contains ONLY that pair and no other. This is 
also a relation, but a very special one.  Another way to think about 
instances is that this unique relation (in our example, it is the 
relation which holds only between MW and his wife, and relates no 
other individuals: it might be called their particular marriage 
relationship) is a subset of the married relation, ie subrelation of 
it: a thing of the same kind,  but very specialised; in fact, it is 
as specialised as a binary relation can get.

This 'extensional' way of thinking about relations has the merit of 
corresponding to logical analysis and, if used carefully, to much of 
ordinary usage.  What it fails to do, however, is provide a more 
delicate distinction which some folk have suggested is necessary in 
an ontology which can reflect the distinctions made in natural 
language, which is that between the various *ways* that a relation 
might hold. For example, suppose that we say that being wise is a 
property (of people), which is true of Socrates (for example) but not 
true of our current President (for example). That seems harmless, but 
someone might object that he wants to not just say that Socrates is 
wise, but to say something more particular about the particular way 
that he was wise: to say something, as we might phrase it, about 
Socrates' wisdom, as opposed to wisdom in general. ("How do I love 
thee? Let me count the ways..." If 'love' is a set of pairs, there's 
no counting to be done.) Some have argued that the need to be able to 
talk about 'tropes' such as these requires a richer ontology of 
relations: we need, it is argued, to be able to speak of a relation 
not just as something with an extension, but as having some other 
aspects as well, so that there is more to being wise than just being 
in a particular set: there is also the particular 'way' that you are 
in the set, or the 'glue' that binds you to the set, or some such 
locution. (The notion of 'nexus' in Sowa's upper ontology is related 
to this intuition, I believe, as is the general idea of a 'situation' 
or 'predication'; all of these, in their various ways, seem to be 
entities which are introduced to stand for a kind of focus of where a 
relation, or collection of relations, holds true of a set of things. 
"trope", a distinctly exotic Australian philosopher's word, is 
apparently the general-purpose technical term.)

I said that an extensional view of relations fails to deal with 
tropes; but it is consistent with an ontology of tropes. It just 
means that you have to be explicit about the 'ways', and mention them 
directly, instead of expecting the notion of 'relation' to do it for 
you for free. And there are many such proposals in the literature, 
including Jerry Hobb's 'promiscuous ontology' which Ive mentioned 
before in these discussions, the fairly standard 'event' ontological 
style based on case grammar, where a mere predication is rendered as 
an existence claim plus a collection of binary case relations (agent, 
object, patient, time, place, ....), the Sanskrit variation, and the 
various ideas of 'thirdness' arising from Pierce's philosophy. All of 
these can be seen as ways of extending the ontology - introducing new 
kinds of entities in addition to the things that yer average naive 
realist might think of - in order to allow finer ways of 
distinguishing ways that things can be true which are more subtle 
than the starkly simple crudity of being in a set. But the LOGICAL 
point is that by making these things explicit, one can manage with a 
purely extensional notion of relation.  If you want a complex notion 
of relationship, the ontological moral is, identify as clearly as 
possible what it is that makes your notion of 'relation' so complex, 
then get that complexity out into the open;  make it into an actual 
thing, and relieve the notion of 'relation' of that extra ontological 
burden. If relations vary with time, make times explicit; if they 
have different ways of being true, make the ways explicit; if they 
can be true in some worlds but not in others, make the worlds 
explicit.  Insisting the relations are purely extensional forces 
everyone to get all their hidden ontological assumptions onto the 
logical table where everyone else can see them.
