Well, I sorta thought we said this in the title,
not to mention repeatedly throughout the article:

| &quot;Interpretation as Action: The Risk of Inquiry&quot;
|
| The fallibility of signs is shared with the human activities of interpretation and inquiry,
| and bears a relation to the situated character of all dynamic processes of determination.
| |
| | If doubt and indeterminateness were wholly within the mind --
| | whatever that may signify -- purely mental processes ought
| | to get rid of them.  But experimental procedure signifies
| | that actual alteration of an external situation is necessary
| | to effect the conversion.  A 'situation' undergoes, through
| | operations directed by thought, transition from problematic
| | to settled, from internal discontinuity to coherency and
| | organization.  (Dewey, TQFC, p. 185).
| |
| | John Dewey, &quot;The Quest for Certainty&quot;, in J.A. Boydston (ed.),
| |'John Dewey:  The Later Works, 1925-1953, (Vol 4: 1929)',
| | Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, IL, 1988.

This attitude toward object reality derives from Peirce's ground-breaking,
cornerstone-laying work to discern the &quot;Logic of Science&quot;, real science,
with which he was very much acquainted, however labeled or libeled as
a &quot;mere logician&quot; he may've been by some people, who had been content
until his time, as many still are, to lounge in their armchairs
and listen to the facile fantasias of the Mills Brothers.

H H Pattee wrote (some emphasis lost):
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure how I fit into this discussion. Jon obviously has enough comments to answer without
&gt; my adding more. Anyway, here is another view of inquiry. I am not sure how Jon's discussion of
&gt; inquiry gets into the observable world of science. As a non-logician, it seems to me Jon is just
&gt; inquiring into Peirce and logical strings and graphs. If this is Peirce's main contribution I can
&gt; understand  why scientists do not pay him much attention. Inquiry to most scientists does not
&gt; really depend on this type of logical analysis, but on imagination and observation. I don't know
&gt; of any cases of discovery in science, or even mathematics, where logical analysis played the
&gt; creative role. Of course, in math proofs require logic, but rarely is logic the source of the
&gt; inquiry.
&gt; 
&gt; I think for most scientists &quot;inquiry&quot; means exploration or looking for something entirely new in
&gt; our experience. After all, modern scientific inquiry did not begin with logic but with the
&gt; extension of our natural senses by instruments and by the extension of our natural imagination by
&gt; mathematics. Modern biology began with the microscope, chemistry with the analytic balance and
&gt; chemical indicators, and physics with the telescope, theodolite, and mathematics. Chronometers,
&gt; galvanometers, spectroscope, mass spectrometers, centrifuges, chromatography, radioactive tracers,
&gt; particle accelerators, and especially mathematics, are the essential prostheses for our senses and
&gt; brains without which scientific inquiry would have come to a dead end like scholasticism.
&gt; 
&gt; The real problem for scientific inquiry is: How do we know what are we looking for? This is an old
&gt; problem. Meno asked Socrates, &quot;But how will you look for something when you don't in the least
&gt; know what it is? How on earth are you going to set up something you don't know as the object of
&gt; your search? To put it another way, even if you come right up against it, how will you know that
&gt; what you have found is the thing you didn't know?&quot; This is the big question, but Socrates gives
&gt; one of his sillier answers: &quot;The soul, since it is immortal and has been born many times, and has
&gt; seen all things both here and in the other world, has learned everything that there is.&quot;
&gt; Therefore, he concludes: . . . &quot;learning is nothing but recollection.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It is not the metaphysics of reincarnation that is silly here (I'm in favor of it). It is
&gt; Socrates' lack of understanding of   problem identification. As we are all too well aware today,
&gt; if you don't know what you are looking for, access to an infinite database (no matter how well
&gt; indexed, and whether it is in an immortal soul or in an infinitely fast computer) is not a
&gt; solution. In fact, the more the data, the worse the problem. You still don't know what you are
&gt; looking for. I think Peirce worried about this problem too, but I don't think he found an adequate
&gt; answer. Jon may have another opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; There have been two extreme approaches to this problem. At one extreme is the assumption of
&gt; initial total ignorance. Then blind search and natural selection is the only hope. Of course, this
&gt; requires many trials and memory of failures and successes (i.e., the Darwinian solution:
&gt; replication, heritable variation, and natural selection, also assumed by evolutionary
&gt; epistemologists, a la Campbell, Popper, et al.). The other extreme, a physical equivalent of
&gt; Socrates omniscient soul, is a Laplacean omnipotent determinism where free will and ignorance are
&gt; just illusions and have nothing to do with the inexorable course of events. Neither of these
&gt; extremes alone makes much sense in terms of current physics and biology. Today the active
&gt; controversy in evolution is over finding a suitable balance between chance and determinism, that
&gt; is, between Darwinian blind search and selection and non-selective self-organizing (dynamic)
&gt; processes.
&gt; 
&gt; I think there are two misconceptions of the search problem. The first is that the search space it
&gt; too large. The main criticism of the creationists, intelligent design theists, and even the
&gt; self-organizing anti-Darwinians, is that the search space for the totally ignorant is so large
&gt; that successful blind search is too improbable. But the evidence is clear that in the course of
&gt; evolution organisms have greatly increased their searchable domains by adding more sensors and
&gt; motor controls; and as I pointed out above, science also depends for its progress on greatly
&gt; increasing its searchable domains by instrumentation. Enlarging the searchable domain is not the
&gt; problem, it is part of the answer to evolution and learning. What would be the evolutionary future
&gt; of organisms if their inquiries were restricted to a fixed set of sensors (or a fixed logic)? The
&gt; second misconception is that &quot;blind&quot; applies to the entire search process. But &quot;blind&quot; applies
&gt; only to a simple initial event in a highly organized living system that has adapted to a highly
&gt; ordered environment. This is a genetic form or analog of intelligence. Similarly, there is at some
&gt; level in every creative idea a blind search, but usually in the context of highly developed
&gt; problem domain.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the most significant change in attitudes towards this balance between determinism and
&gt; chance in the last 20 years has been the loss of dominance of logic-based, hard-programmed
&gt; problem-solving, as in GOFAI (good old fashioned AI) and the renewed appreciation of the power of
&gt; biological analogs like neural nets and genetic algorithms to discover solutions and integrate
&gt; behaviors. Most important, however, has been the realization that blind search and selection
&gt; requires strong, open-ended interactions with a rich, highly-ordered (i.e., descriptively
&gt; compressible) environment (as has been partially simulated by environmentally &quot;embedded autonomous
&gt; robots&quot;) What is still missing in these robots is the open-ended ability to construct new sensors.
&gt; It appears that only with this unrestricted &quot;sensing&quot; of a rich, ordered environment does a
&gt; balanced coupling of self-organization and blind search and natural selection become effective.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are a few references on these points:
&gt; Brooks, R., &quot;Intelligence without reason.&quot; In 12th Int. Conf. on AI, Morgan Kauffman, 1991.
&gt; Campbell, D., &quot;Evolutionary epistemology.&quot; In The Philosophy of Karl Popper, Schilpp, ed.,
&gt; Open Court, 1974.
&gt; Cariani, P. &quot;Some epistemological implications of devices that construct their own sensors
&gt; and effectors.&quot;  In Artificial Life II, Langton, et al, eds., Addison-Wesley, 1992.
&gt; Clark, A., &quot;Being there.&quot; MIT Press, 1997.
&gt; Conrad, M., &quot;The geometry of evolution.&quot; BioSystems 24, 61-81, 1990.
&gt; Dawkins, R., &quot;The evolution of evolution.&quot; Artificial life I, Langton, ed.,
&gt; Addison-Wesley, 1989, p.201.
&gt; 
&gt; This is one view of inquiry.  I suspect I am missing something about Jon's view.
