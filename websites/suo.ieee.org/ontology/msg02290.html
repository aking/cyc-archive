&gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am still looking for easy ways to explain what's wrong with
&gt; &gt; this purported "analysis", "definition", "transliteration", or
&gt; &gt; whatever.  The reason why it is important no longer has anything
&gt; &gt; to do with triadicity specifically, but now has to do with whether
&gt; &gt; posterity will judge the SUO group as having understood even so much
&gt; &gt; as what a relation or a tuple is.  At the present time that question
&gt; &gt; is seriously in doubt.  Yes, of course, people are able to recite
&gt; &gt; the phrase that "a relation is a set of tuples", but whether they
&gt; &gt; can follow up any significant number of the consequences of that
&gt; &gt; token tenet, and whether they can recognize a tuple in many of
&gt; &gt; its sundry disguises, those are different questions altogether.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, while I was pondering, weak and weary, this whole problematic
&gt; &gt; scene, I happened to recall a sort of a pedagogical moment from my own
&gt; &gt; education that I thought might serve as a generic brand of anecdote,
&gt; &gt; bringing perhaps a little bit of illumination on the present case.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the subject of Real Analysis, one is concerned
&gt; &gt; with spaces and functions of the following types:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; |  Dimension    |  Space        |  Function     |
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; |  1            |  R^1 = R      |  R^1 -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; |  2            |  R^2 = RxR    |  R^2 -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; |  3            |  R^3 = RxRxR  |  R^3 -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; |  ...          |  ...          |  ...          |
&gt; &gt; |  n            |  R^n          |  R^n -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, it is typical to begin with the one-dimensional case
&gt; &gt; and gradually to work toward the multi-dimensional setting.
&gt; &gt; In referring to the elements of R and mappings from R to R,
&gt; &gt; one naturally uses notations like "x in R",  "f : R -&gt; R",
&gt; &gt; and the value of f at x is written "f(x)".  So far, so good.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When one finally arrives at the n-dimensional case, it is
&gt; &gt; usual to write things like "x = &lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;&gt;", using
&gt; &gt; either the single letter or the coordinate list, depending
&gt; &gt; on whichever is convenient at a given moment of discussion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But how do you write the value of f at x?  Strictly speaking,
&gt; &gt; that is, according to the rulebook of syntactic substitution,
&gt; &gt; one ought to write either "f(x)" or "f(&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;&gt;)",
&gt; &gt; and when you go through this ringer for the first time, some
&gt; &gt; professors will actually insist that you preserve this purity
&gt; &gt; of notational discipline, sanctioning "f(x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;)" as
&gt; &gt; a vile abuse of notation.  Of course, this degree of pickiness
&gt; &gt; will all seem a bit silly, at first and then again a few months
&gt; &gt; later when you have much worse problems to worry about, but still,
&gt; &gt; experience teaches the experienced teacher that there is a point
&gt; &gt; to it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Moral Of The Story?  Well, one thing ought to be perfectly clear
&gt; &gt; by now to all sensible observers, and that is that the nature and
&gt; &gt; the structure of the mathematical object in question, whether it
&gt; &gt; is x in R^n or else f : R^n -&gt; R, is not affected one liitle bit
&gt; &gt; by the syntactic expression, whatever its structure, that is used
&gt; &gt; to refer to it.  And if anybody thinks to make ontological capital
&gt; &gt; off the abuse of notation, or the poetic license, that permits us
&gt; &gt; to write "f(x, y, z)" instead of "f(&lt;x, y, z&gt;)", or vice versa,
&gt; &gt; then that person has another think coming.  The arity of the
&gt; &gt; relation is the same either way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I agree that if you have some set of binary relations
&gt;     that essentially define the coordinate positions of
&gt;     components in some higher arity relation then there
&gt;     is also the higher arity relation.

You are saying here that the definition of a k-tuple
in terms of its k coordinate projections has nothing
to do with the potential analysis, decomposition, or
whatever, of the whole k-adic relation into possibly
simpler relations, arity-wise.   Welcome to the club!

So this conception of cartesian product space, which
was not discovered by Quine fifty years ago, but has
made up a staple article of furniture in mathematics,
since, here's a hint, Descartes, has been an utterly
irrelevant red herring since the initial moment that
it first got foisted on the scene.

&gt; That was not the issue.  Indeed, the axiom that Chris M
&gt; has put together on my behalf specifically states this.
&gt; The issue was whether the higher arity relation could be
&gt; represented by some set of binary relations.  You do not
&gt; seem to be disputing that this can be done in the manner
&gt; I have described.

Again, you, with a little bit -- okay, a lot -- of non-help
from others, are consistently failing to distinguish between
a relation, which is, as you say, a set, and a single tuple.

The coordinate projections are relevant to the structure of
a single k-tuple.  To talk about analyzing a whole relation
in terms of other entire relations, putatively simpler ones,
one needs to bring in operations that operate on whole sets.
Examples of 2-adic set operations (so 3-adic set relations)
are things like Intersection, Union, Relational Composition.
Examples of 1-adic set operations (so 2-adic set relations)
are things like Complementation and the various Projections.
To do anything that qualifies as an "analysis" (up-chunking)
of a set, one would have to use "forms of analysis" that are
at least as adic as 2-adic set operations (3-adic relations).

&gt; Indeed your argument now seems to be that it says the
&gt; same thing (of course it should say the same thing).
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I understood that a part of your argument was that n-adic
&gt;     relations could ALWAYS be "decomposed" into triadic relations,
&gt;     but not necessarily to binary relations.

Yes, that is correct.  But people are responsible only for what
they actually say.  And the way that I and my whole army uses
the terms "composition" and "decomposition" is criterial to
the claim being made.  It is only that a set of folks who
have never bothered to read or to understand the initial
statement of the issue have cluttered up the beach with
their peculiar variety of cargo-cultism.

&gt; However, following the argument you seem to be putting forward here,
&gt; if I have a 4-adic, or 5-adic relation, then "decomposing" it does
&gt; not put it out of existence, it only means that it is implied rather
&gt; than explicit in some ontology.

This one tuple at a time investigation has nothing
to do with the matter of analyzing whole relations.

&gt; This seems to be arguing both ends against the middle to me.

No, I'm afraid you guys have been shadow-boxing in the dark,
and nobody even rang the bell.
