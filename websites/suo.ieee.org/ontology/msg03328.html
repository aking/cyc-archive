JA, quoting CSP:

    | Admitting, then, that the question of Pragmatism is the Question of Abduction,
    | let us consider it under that form.  What is good abduction?  What should an
    | explanatory hypothesis be to be worthy to rank as a hypothesis?  Of course,
    | it must explain the facts.  But what other conditions ought it to fulfill
    | to be good?  The question of the goodness of anything is whether that
    | thing fulfills its end.  What, then, is the end of an explanatory
    | hypothesis?  Its end is, through subjection to the test of
    | experiment, to lead to the avoidance of all surprise and
    | to the establishment of a habit of positive expectation
    | that shall not be disappointed.  Any hypothesis,
    | therefore, may be admissible, in the absence of any
    | special reasons to the contrary, provided it be capable
    | of experimental verification and only in so far as it is
    | capable of such verification.  This is approximately the doctrine
    | of pragmatism.  But just here a broad question opens out before us.
    | What are we to understand by experimental verification?  The answer to that
    | involves the whole logic of induction.  Let me point out to you the different
    | opinions which we actually find men holding today, perhaps not consistently, but
    | thinking that they hold them, upon this subject.  (LOP 1903, 250;  CP 5.197-198).
    |
    | Charles Sanders Peirce,
    |'Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right Thinking',
    | The 1903 Harvard 'Lectures on Pragmatism' (= LOP 1903),
    | Patricia Ann Turrisi (ed.), SUNY Press, Albany, NY, 1997.

HP: This sounds perfectly normal, but why is Peirce given so much credit for this &quot;normal&quot; view?
    Obviously, induction is important too, but &quot;any hypothesis&quot; is not generally &quot;admissible&quot;.
    What is missing in this approximate doctrine is mention of the aesthetic elements of
    explanations:  simplicity, beauty, fecundity, etc., and clues for &quot;distinguishing
    this beauty from merely formal attractiveness ... a test so difficult that it
    may baffle the most penetrating scientific minds&quot; (Polanyi).

JC: Speaking of old fashioned views, what's wrong with:

JC, quoting IN:

    | RULE 1
    | We are to admit no more causes of natural things, than such as are both true and
    | sufficient to explain their appearances.  To this purpose the philosophers say,
    | that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain, when less will serve;
    | for Nature is pleased with simplicity, and affects not the pomp of
    | superfluous causes.
    |
    | RULE 2
    | Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.
    | As to respiration in a man, and in a beast;  the descent of stones in Europe and in America;
    | the light of our culinary fire and of the sun;  the reflection of light in the earth, and in
    | the planets.
    |
    | RULE 3
    | The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intension nor remission of degrees,
    | and which are found to belong to all bodies within reach of our experiments, are to
    | be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.  For since the qualities
    | of bodies are only known to us by experiments, we are to hold for universal, all such as
    | universally agree with experiments;  and such as are not liable to diminution, can never
    | be quite taken away.
    |
    | We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence of experiments for the sake of dreams
    | and vain fictions of our own devising;  nor are we to recede from the analogy of Nature,
    | which is wont to be simple, and always consonant to itself.  We no other way know the
    | extension of bodies, than by our senses, nor do these reach it in all bodies;  but
    | because we perceive extension in all that are sensible, therefore we ascribe it
    | universally to all others, also.
    |
    | That abundance of bodies are hard we learn by experience.
    | And because the hardness of the whole arises from the
    | hardness of the parts, we therefore justly infer the
    | hardness of the undivided particles not only of the
    | bodies we feel but of all others.
    |
    | That all bodies are impenetrable we gather not from reason,
    | but from sensation.  The bodies which we handle we find
    | impenetrables and thence conclude impenetrability to
    | be a universal property of all bodies whatsoever.
    |
    | That all bodies are moveable, and endowed with certain powers
    | (which we call the forces of inertia), or persevering in their
    | motion or in their rest, we only infer from the like properties
    | observed in the bodies which we have seen.
    |
    | The extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and force of inertia of the whole
    | result from the extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and forces of inertia
    | of the parts:  and thence we conclude that the least particles of all bodies to be
    | also all extended, and hard, and impenetrable, and moveable, and endowed with their
    | proper forces of inertia.  And this is the foundation of all philosophy.  Moreover,
    | that the divided but contiguous particles of bodies may be separated from one another,
    | is a matter of observation;  and, in the particles that remain undivided, our minds are
    | able to distinguish yet lesser parts, as is mathematically demonstrated.  But whether
    | the parts so distinguished, and not yet divided, may, by the powers of nature, be
    | actually divided and separated from one another, we cannot certainly determine.
    | Yet had we the proof of but one experiment, that any undivided particle, in
    | breaking a hard and solid body, suffered a division, we might by virtue of
    | this rule, conclude, that the undivided as well as the divided particles,
    | may be divided and actually separated into infinity.
    |
    | Lastly, if it universally appears, by experiments and astronomical observations, that
    | all bodies about the earth, gravitate toward the earth;  and that in proportion to the
    | quantity of matter which they severally contain;  that the moon likewise, according to
    | the quantity of its matter, gravitates toward the earth;  that on the other hand our
    | sea gravitates toward the moon;  and all the planets mutually one toward another;
    | and the comets in like manner towards the sun;  we must, in consequence of this
    | rule, universally allow, that all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle
    | of mutual gravitation.
    |
    | For the argument from the appearances concludes with more force for the
    | universal gravitation of all bodies, than for their impenetrability, of
    | which among those in the celestial regions, we have no experiments, nor
    | any manner of observation.  Not that I affirm gravity to be essential to
    | all bodies.  By their inherent force I mean nothing but their force of
    | inertia.  This is immutable.  Their gravity is diminished as they recede
    | from the earth.
    |
    | RULE 4
    | In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions collected by general induction
    | from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses
    | that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either
    | be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.  This rule we must follow that the
    | argument of induction may not be evaded by hypotheses.

JA, quoting IN:

    &quot;Hypotheses non fingo&quot;

JA, quoting CSP:

    | Having discovered and demonstrated the grounds of the possibility of
    | the three inferences, let us take a preliminary glance at the manner in
    | which additions to these principles may make them grounds of proceedure.
    |
    | The principle of inference 'à priori' has been apodictically demonstrated;
    | the principle of inductive inference has been shown upon sufficient evidence
    | to be true;  the principle of inference 'à posteriori' has been shown to be one
    | which nothing can contradict.  These three degrees of modality in the principles of
    | the three inferences show the amount of certainty which each is capable of affording.
    | Inference 'à priori' is as we all know the only apodictic proceedure;  yet no one
    | thinks of questioning a good induction;  while inference 'à posteriori' is
    | proverbially uncertain.  'Hypotheses non fingo', said Newton;  striving
    | to place his theory on a firm inductive basis.  Yet provisionally we
    | must make hypotheses;  we start with them;  the baby when he lies
    | turning his fingers before his eyes is testing a hypothesis he has
    | already formed, as to the connection of touch and sight.  Apodictic
    | reasoning can only be applied to the manipulation of our knowledge;
    | it never can extend it.  So that it is an induction which eventually
    | settles every question of science;  and nine-tenths of the inferences
    | we draw in any hour not of study are of this kind.
