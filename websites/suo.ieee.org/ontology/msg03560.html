been there ...

&gt; I am trying to figure out how the cactus language
&gt; that you (Jon) are proposing is going to provide
&gt; what normal First Order Predicate Logic doesn't.

a couple of cautionary tales, okay three:

1.  i just spent 30 yrs working on zero, and i had the shoulder's
    of peirce's alpha ex-graphs from which to espy the landscape.

2.  i have already figured out how i will make my own run at the next level,
    and this approach is based not so much on peirce 1900 as on peirce 1870.
    so far as i can tell at present, it gets us &quot;something tantamount to&quot; the
    power of quantificational calculus (fol) via a &quot;higher order propositional
    extension of logical graphs&quot; (hop log).  in the way that i use the phrase,
    a &quot;higher order proposition&quot; is a &quot;proposition about propositions&quot;, and so,
    for instance, if we are thinking of props as being of type q : X -&gt; %B%,
    then the next order of hops have a type h : (X -&gt; %B%) -&gt; %B%.  all of
    these formal objects are already there in plato's heaven somewhere,
    but finding an earthly calculus for them is another thing entirely.
    the tantalizing thing about this, if i can carry the interpretive
    labor through, is that it gets you all &quot;generalized quantifiers&quot;
    in one fell swoop of the very same net.  i think.

3.  it's not about the expressiveness &quot;in principle&quot; --
    it's really about the efficiency &quot;in practice&quot; ...

&gt; If I want to say &quot;all cats have a tail&quot; something like:
&gt; 
&gt; forall c
&gt;    such that c is an instance of Cat
&gt; there exists a t
&gt;    such that t is an instance of Tail
&gt; There exists h
&gt;    such that h is a particular tuple/relational-instance of 'has'
&gt; There exists no more than one h
&gt;    whereby h expresses the connection between c and t
&gt; 
&gt; Now this is a rough way of expressing this.
&gt; How would the cactus language make this expression
&gt;    1) clearer
&gt;    2) more compact
&gt;    3) less ambiguous
&gt;    4) more powerful
&gt; 
&gt; or any other qualifier you would want to examine?

i will dig up the few examples that i wrote out somewhere
of how this sort of scheme might extend to quantification.

&gt; Right now, the cactus language looks like a lot of syntax
&gt; to memorize with no discernable advantage in expressing
&gt; common facts about the world to a computer.

hmmm.  well, all that formal grammar business was really the rational
reconstruction of how i probably should have written the basic parser,
but that is just what it takes to get computers to process any halfway
adequate language for anything whatever.  cacti are a fairly standard
item in graph theory, and so it usually takes me only about 3 minutes
to explain the variant &quot;painting&quot; rules to your average graph theorist.
i myself started using peirce's alpha for all my prop thinking more
than 30 yrs ago, and this stuff naturally grew out of that, so it's
pretty much my rep of choice.  when i started on comp reasoning,
it was just the ticket to save all sorts of trivial re-proving
of trivial theorems, or the inordinate caching thereof.
i usually think in the graphs though -- the string
language is just there for the sake of disk storage.

you might pick some complex prop expressions, and we could compare the representations.
i did truncated turing machines, sowa's top level cats, and many others i could look up.
