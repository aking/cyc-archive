&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; When I saw the title of your message I was very interested,
&gt; becuase I still haven't gotten the message, in spite of
&gt; reading the web references you had posted earlier.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, your message didn't get to the point at all.

John,

I appreciate your interest and your persistence.
The plain facts are that I tire easily, that some
of this stuff quite literally gives me headaches
trying to remember work that I may have started
10, 20, 30 years ago, when I was too tongue-tied
a novice to have stored it away in any form but
that of a running mental cinema and, yes, it's
true, a large number of old blues harmonica tunes
that I made up to capture the riff of it all, until
one day when I discovered that Pascal was the tongue
of my mutter courage, and began to transduce it all
into that medium, at the price, however, of forsaking
all hope of the anglish language for almost a decade.
So I must ask for your patience also.

&gt; As I've indicated in earlier correspondence, your writing
&gt; style is interesting and entertaining.  Unfortunately, it
&gt; detracts from the technical points you are trying to make.
&gt; And also, unfortunately, some of us have trouble making
&gt; the time to read it.
&gt; 
&gt; Can you possibly put aside the poetry
&gt; and word play for a while ...

Yes, for a while ...
No, not for long ...
It is all twined
Together, I fear.

&gt; and get succinctly to the technical
&gt; (or philisophical, if you will) point?

I really do not understand this conduct.
I do not make a practice of suggesting
prior constraints on what other people
choose to contribute, of telling them
how they ought to integrate, or not,
the various components of their life,
or of offering pointers on stylistics,
so I do not comprehend why other people
feel like they can take these unreciprocal
liberties with what I am given to do here.
I write the way that I think -- it is not
being made up to be anything else but that.
I do believe that I write in several diverse
styles -- could be it's only me who thinks so --
and some of them I believe are very detailed,
rigorous, succinct, even terse, to the point
that they bore me to tears if not everyone else.
Folks have in former times complained that I wrote
notes that were too long, so I tried to accommodate
by taking the measure of when I got tired as a guess
that my reader would likely be even moreso, and so to
break things up into more natural units of exchange.

&gt; I'd really like to understand this issue.  And, by the way,
&gt; other interesting and possibly important points you may
&gt; bring up, but that I may loose because I loose them in
&gt; your colorful writing.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; 
&gt; John Velman

I am doing the best that I can,
I am tired of trying to be sorry,

Jon Awbrey
