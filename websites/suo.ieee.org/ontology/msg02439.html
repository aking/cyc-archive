Matthew, new stuff is unindentional.

JA:  Please define "Join".
     It 'is' required to support 'your' view.

MW:  Au contraire it is required to support your view.

MW:  I will be truly surprised if a man of your considerable
     knowledge is not completely aware of what an SQL inner
     join is.  If not I am inclined to suggest that you
     consult an SQL manual, or perhaps the SQL3 standard
     (if that is still the latest version) and look it up.
     If you do know I suggest you say where you are going
     instead of playing games.  It would really be nice to
     get to the point here.

JA:  What is important here?

JA:  You have put forth a claim that all k-adic relations
     can be defined in terms of at most 2-adic relations.

MW:  Well lets be careful, because I speak from experience, not proof.
     I have not come across anything that cannot be represented by
     dyadic relations alone.

Would you really accept that kind of statement from anybody else?
Would you take what somebody else represents as the conclusions
of their experience as conclusive on any issue of import to you?
Would it make an end to your quest for knowledge on any score?
I didn't think so.

Experience, instinct, intuition, even revelation, if you will,
are good raw materials, sources of the givens and the guesses
that we amalgamate and refine into knowledge, but it is quite
well known, and through even harder experience, if you stop
to think about it, how deceptive and fallible they can be,
especially if they are allowed to go unchecked, and fail
to be ruthlessly cross-checked against one another.

In my experience, you are making a mistake that is fairly typical
of a certain type of reductive disposition in representing your
experience in this way.  You say that everything reduces to Z,
and then you simply refuse to cognize anything that is not Z.
Those of us who survived the Cognitive Science Revolution
a few years back, before the Counter-Revolt, know this
behavior well, and the pattern of what happened then
is pretty much the perfect paradigm for what always
seems to happen in these cases.  In the end the
Behaviorists did not really lose the Revolution.
When they started to lose their funding they just
changed the name of their R^2 (Rat-Running) subfield
to "Animal Cognition" and went on precisely as before.
And if you look closely at what the Onetime Revolters are
actually doing these days, you will be struck by its uncanny
similarity to the most reductionist approaches and the most
insensitive to complexity attitudes of the very ways that
they onetime revolted against.  I am guessing that there
is probably some order of human intellectual historical
law that says our human race will always run this route.

JA:  This, if true, would be important for almost too many reasons
     to mention, ranging from achieving maximum clarity and optimal
     efficiency in everything from our basic conceptual frameworks
     to our computational implementations of relational databases
     and logical knowledge bases.  If it is not true, then there
     are many reasons why we need to know that, too, as it bears
     on the question of a "minimally adequate resource base" for
     supporting all of these tasks and more.

MW:  OK, I'd just like to get there sooner rather than later.

Yes, but there is this big "if" sign that is in the way.
I find that is best to slow down when one approaches it.

JA:  Aside from the content of the specific claim that you have made,
     of a sort that is commonly recognized in all formal disciplines
     to require of its proposer either a detailed definition or an
     explicit proof, there is a way in which it can serve us as an
     object example, of how and how not to carry on the activities
     of analysis, clarification, construction, definition, proof,
     and so on -- kind of like a test case to cut our teeth on,
     to see whether we really know how to do these things in
     such a way that we can eventually settle on clear ends.

MW:  OK -- but if everything takes this long we are in trouble.

JA:  So, all in all, I think that it is kind of important,
     and I believe that clarity and effectiveness in all
     of the components that I have just mentioned above
     are topics of major import to the task of building
     a SUO, and so I will continue to import them.

JA:  As to the present moment in our discussions,
     I am afraid that ball remains in your court.
     You have made a claim and you must defend it
     or give it up -- I did not make up the rules.

MW:  Ah, now I thought that I was challenging your
     claim that triadicity is irreducible, and you
     haven't substantiated that, so presumably you
     have given that up?

We have already been over this ground several times,
but perhaps it is time for yet another quick review:

A person who claims that everything of type X can be reduced,
according to some notion of reduction Y, to things of type Z,
is required to define all of these things and to prove it so.

Paradigmatic examples:

1.  X = non-neg integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
    Y = sum of numbers other than itself and 0.
    Z = {1}

    Hence, 3 is reducible to sums of 1's.
    Proof: 3 = 1+1+1.

2.  X = positive integers 1, 2, 3, ...
    Y = product of numbers other than itself and 1.
    Z = primes

    Hence, 3 is irreducible under the notion Y,
    since its only factorizations are 1x3 and 3x1,
    which are excluded as trivial cases under notion Y.
    This means that we can put 3 in Z as being one of the
    primitive components from which other numbers are built
    according to the mode of synthesis that corresponds to Y.

With respect to the two most common notions of reduction for relations
that I know about, what I eventually called "compositive reduction"
and "projective reduction", I satisfied all of these requirements,
giving explicit definitions and the requisite examples or proofs
to demonstrate what I asserted.  So my lessons are done here.

But now you say, for the set X = {finite valence relations},
that there is yet another method or notion of reduction Y,
according to which X reduces to Z = {2-adic relations}.

Now, as far as I am concerned, there are many perfectly useful
ways of analying relations where the method of analysis Y itself
invokes one or another 3-adic relations to carry out the process.
The case of projective reduction that I gave above is one of these.
But, from your point of view, I am just guessing, I should think
that it would amount to a somewhat Pyrrhic victory if you are
forced to invoke 3-adic relations within the definition of Y.
So far, you have not yet defined the notion of reduction Y
that you claim to have in mind, nor given a proof that it
works for the X in question.  I said that I would help
you do this if it were at all possible, but for the
moment you are not giving me anything to go on.
I am not the one to say where this is going --
we are following your gnosis, not mine.

MW:  Specifically, you claimed that a particular triadic form of
     an "and" relation could not be represented by dyadic relations.
     I have done that.

No, you have not.  You have waved your hands in the direction of some
off-the-shelf software, saying that you have let George or Bill do it
for you, and that you do not really care what they used to do it, but
your claim depends on warranting that no non-Z's were used anywhere in
the process, and so I am afraid that you really ought to care, for you
cannot escape accountability for their actions quite so easily nor for
what adicities of relations they employed to do the dirty work for you.

Return with me now to the days of yesteryear, when you could not
just reach up and pull down some "Snake Oil Panacea" (SOP) off
your virtual shelf, but actually had to write a program to do
the job.  All I am asking is very simple, just try to think
about what would have to go into a procedure for computing
the putative join from the data given.  If you can do that
without using a 3-adic relation anywhere in the process,
then quit wasting your time talking to me and race down
to your local neighborhood patent office post haste!

MW:  As I see it you have to prove that it doesn't represent the
     triadic relation.  The join is irrelevant to the argument.

No, the adicities of the relations invoked in the join also count.

MW:  It merely illustrates that the original
     information can be presented.

We already know that it can be represented.
The question is whether it has a reduction
that employs nothing but 2-adic relations.

MW:  We could just as easily use some different way of showing this,
     e.g. by asking specific questions and seeing if the information
     is there.  So I think this is a red herring.

All your hand-waving does nothing to clear the air.

JA:  I said that I would help you formalize it if
     it could be formalized -- laying your hand
     on this or that good book and swearing that
     it's the truth may indeed be a common brand
     of formalization, but it is not the species
     that it is accepted in this court of inquiry,
     and until you say where in what good book it
     says so, no public forum can begin to examine
     your evidence.  I am perfectly aware of what
     logical operations are logically involved in
     the construction of all sorts of joins, and
     I have been since the days when I grad-assed
     as a data archivist and statistical programmer,
     which is why I do not say the things you say,
     but it is you who cannot see the AND's at
     the bottom of these nests, and so I have
     been trying to magnify them for you,
     because you still seem to me like
     an honest entomologist.

MW:  I am aware that you seem to think that "and"
     is some how critical here, but I don't really
     understand why.

You are the one who has been making a very strong claim.
I get the feeling that maybe you do not even understand
yet how outrageous a claim it is.  To say that you know
a way to define a 3-adic relation without using anything
but 2-adic relations in the definition is a very strong
assertion.  It fails to be true of any definition that
you put forth just as soon as you invoke even a single
relation of valence greater than 2 to do it.  "AND" is
just one example of a 3-adic relation that is somewhat
unlikely you could do without in formulating an express
definition of almost any significant idea, but any other
3-adic relation that you find yourself forced to use would
also puncture this balloon that you have been puffing up here.

JA:  There are, indeed, even larger reasons why this point is important,
     and specifically with regard to the problems of intercommunication
     and interoperation, which, as you can well appreciate, are not any
     kinds of new problems that have just appeared on the human horizon,
     but have, in effect if not in essence, been with us since we began
     to be human.  And folks like me who have spent a lifetime not just
     speculating on these problems from our armchairs but who have come
     up against the obstinate resilience and the obstructive resistance
     of these barriers to just about everything that we try to do, well,
     we take these problems deadpan seriously -- humor, to those in the
     know, is just a symptom of how deadly serious we know it, at heart,
     to be -- and some of us even fancy that we may have learned one or
     two things from the knocks that we have taken, although, of course,
     it could be nothing more than the final stages of punch-drunkeness.

MW:  Well it is of course in solving these interoperation problems --
     the problem that lead to all the work I have done over the
     last 10-15 years, that we have found "reducing" things
     to a binary form to be so useful.

Look, I am sure that if your system does anything at all,
computationally speaking, even so much as adding two bits
on a regular basis, then it is using irreducible 3-adics,
and if you think that all of that is insulated off from
the rest of the system, then that will be your illusion.

The mathematical facts that I am talking about here
are not just some kind of philosophical preference.
They have to with writing programs that implement
syntactic calculi and logical systems that really
work, that allow us to find effective analyses of
those concepts that can be operationally defined.
Informal ways of alluding to reductions just do
not cut any mustard here.

MW:  The reason being that it does not impose constraints
     that do not always apply, which sometimes are imposed
     by non-binary relations.  We then found this seemed to
     work for everything we wished to hold.  This was then
     just convenient to know and use from time to time.

There are better ways to handle the "missing data" problem
in relational databases than to keep on maintaining these
"imaginary reductions".  One way is to generalize from
relations to "relation complexes", where you can have
"up-to-k-adic" tuples in a k-adic relation complex.
But we have to get clear about what relations are
before we can even think to talk about this stuff.

MW:  QUOTE
     INNER JOIN
     A SQL equality join condition.  Rows from two tables are joined
     if the columns match exactly.  The most common join condition.
     Rows that have no match in the other table are not displayed.
     END QUOTE

MW:  I found it in a glossary somewhere on the web, but it looks OK to me.

Just for starters, let me suggest that you attempt to write out
a real definition, in your own words, of what you understand the
join and select operations to be doing with their argument tables,
and we can go from there.
