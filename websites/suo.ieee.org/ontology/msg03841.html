JA = Jon Awbrey
SR = Seth Russell

JA: In assuming a distinction between objects that are inherently subjects
    and subject to concepts that are intrinsically predicates, you have not
    only made a significantly charged ontological assumption, that is to say,
    taken up a non-trivially non-neutral position on the categories of being,
    you have also committed the transparent projection error that is commonly
    known as &quot;confusing the map with the territory&quot;, to wit, &quot;reifying syntax&quot;.

SR: I don't understand this sin.  *If* I have an ontology of representations,
    and that ontology admits objects *and* relations, and I have contrived
    some mechanism to manipulate these representations to model something;
    how is it a sin for that mechanism to manipulate the representations
    of the relations just as easily as it manipulates representations of
    non relational objects?   Where is the confusion in such a mechanism?

JA: It is not a sin, it's a guess.
    The mistake lies in mistaking
    the guess for a fact, and not
    even trying to imagine how it
    might all turn out otherwise.

SR: Oh !! ... do you know a method to tell
    whether a representation is a guess or
    whether it is a fact?

Nota Bene.  Just by way of explaining the
way that I currently understand the words,
&quot;Facthood&quot; and &quot;Guessness&quot; name no essences,
and they are certainly not mutually exclusive,
since every Fact first understudies as a Guess.
So they are pragmatic roles or maybe even just
theatrical parts in which we choose to cast
the various premisses that we contemplate.
The show must go on, at least for a while,
but in the end the whole production lives
or closes depending on whether we cast or
mis-cast them.  If you can't take a risk,
don't try to be on the side of the angels.

My Bet:  They are all guesses.

My Hedge:  There is a way that seems to have shown some utility so far.
Call it &quot;scientific method&quot;, or &quot;semio-automated ontology development&quot;,
or just plain &quot;inquiry&quot; -- it is the way that I and many other lemmas
have chosen to proceed toward our for-hoped, not for-lorn theorematas.

SR: An ontology is not &quot;what it is&quot; --
    it's a theory -- that is to say,
    it's &quot;how you guess it might be&quot;.

SR: Agree ... but that does not answer my particular
    query which asked what the big difference was
    between gussing about relations as opposed
    to guessing about not relational objects.

Sorry, I cannot get what you are asking here.
You had this big *If* in the starring role,
and so I could not tell if you wanted to
contemplate some hypothetical case,
or what.

From previous experience, my chief difficulty interpreting what
you say is that you use all sorts of crucial words in ways that
are different from me, and when I ask you explain your meanings
you typically decline, dissemble, or disappear.  The last time
that we chatted at length, I asked you the following questions:

| 1.  What do you mean by words like &quot;arity&quot; (&quot;adicity&quot;, &quot;valence&quot;)?
|
| 2.  What do you mean by words like &quot;composed&quot; and &quot;composition&quot;?
|
| 3.  What do you mean by words like &quot;relation&quot;?
|
| 4.  What do you mean by words like &quot;arrow&quot;?
|
| 5.  What do you mean by words like &quot;node&quot;?
|
| 6.  What do you mean by words like &quot;represent&quot;?
|
| 7.  What do you mean by words like &quot;structure&quot;?
|
| <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg03740.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg03740.html</A>

I notice that at least two of these, &quot;relation&quot; and &quot;represent&quot;,
have recurred in your present query, and I fear that I can see
no way to answer your question till I have a clue what it means.

Jon Awbrey
