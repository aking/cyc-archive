MSI.  Note 3

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

| 11.  On the Hypotheses Which Lie at the Basis of Geometry (cont.)
|
| Riemann then shows how an n-ply extended manifold
| may be constructed and determination of place in it
| reduced to determinations of quantity.  He then faces
| the question of the measure relations possible in such
| a manifold.  Mathematically, this portion of the essay is
| of great significance, but the technical development need
| not concern us here.  The basic idea may be summarized as
| follows.  Riemann notes that measurement requires quantity
| to be independent of place and he accordingly adopts the
| hypothesis that the length of lines is independent of their
| position so that every line is measurable by every other.
| If we define distance as the square root of a quadratic
| function of the coordinates then Riemann shows that for
| the length of a line to be independent of its position,
| the space in which the line lies must have constant
| curvature.  &quot;The common character of these continua
| whose curvature is constant may also be expressed
| thus, that figures may be moved in them without
| stretching ... whence it follows that in
| aggregates with constant curvature
| figures may have any arbitrary
| position given them.&quot;
|
| In the final section of the essay Riemann turns to the
| question of the application of his technical apparatus
| to empirical space for the determination of its metric
| properties.  In a space of constant curvature in which
| line length is independent of position, the empirical
| truth of the Euclidean axiom that the sum of the angles
| of a triangle is equal to two right angles is sufficient
| to determine the metric properties of that space.  But such
| empirical determinations run into difficulty in the cases of
| the infinitely great and the infinitely small.  &quot;The questions
| about the infinitely gerat are for the interpretation of nature
| useless questions&quot;, according to Riemann, but the same is not true
| on the side of the infinitely small.  He continues:
|
| | If we suppose that bodies exist independently of position,
| | the curvature is everywhere constant, and it then results
| | from astronomical measurements that it cannot be different
| | from zero;  or at any rate its reciprocal must be an area
| | in comparison with which the range of our telescopes may
| | be neglected.  But if this independence of bodies from
| | position does not exist, we cannot draw conclusions
| | from metric relations of the great, to those of the
| | infinitely small;  in that case the curvature at
| | each point may have an arbitrary value in three
| | directions, provided that the total curvature
| | of every measurable portion of space does not
| | differ sensibly from zero.  ...  Now it seems
| | that the empirical notions on which the metrical
| | determinations of space are founded, the notion of
| | a solid body and a ray of light, cease to be valid
| | for the infinitely small.  We are therefore quite
| | at liberty to suppose that the metric relations
| | of space in the infinitely small do not conform
| | to the hypotheses of geometry;  and we ought in
| | fact to suppose it, if we can thereby obtain a
| | simpler explanation of phenomena.
| |
| | The question of the validity of the hypotheses of
| | geometry in the infinitely small is bound up with
| | the question of the ground of the metric relations
| | of space.  In this last question ... is found the
| | application of the remark made above;  that in a
| | discrete manifoldness, the ground of its metric
| | relations is given in the notion of it, while
| | in a continuous manifoldness, this ground
| | must come from outside.  Either therefore
| | the reality which underlies space must
| | form a discrete manifoldness, or we
| | must seek the ground of its metric
| | relations outside it, in binding
| | forces which act upon it.
|
| But the final answer to this question, Riemann asserts,
| must come from physics rather than from pure mathematics.
