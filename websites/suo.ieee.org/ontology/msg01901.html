I agree with John and Chris below.

As Deputy Convenor of ISO TC184/SC4/WG10 and current head of UK 
delegation to ISO TC184/SC4 I am probably one of the more
experienced standards developers here. So I will give my 2 cents
worth on when a vote on a document is justified. I think there
are just two (good) reasons:

1. A document has reached a level of maturity and completeness
where a formal review is required to assess consensus and to 
identify issues against the document that require resolution
before it could be issued as a standard.

2. A member of the standards community has the opportunity to
obtain funding to do some standardisation work, and some 
recognition of what he is proposing to do is supportive in 
helping him to get that funding.

I have certainly seen votes on other occasions, and as I see
it the value has been nill (well actually negative because of 
the unnecessary energy consumed - we have a case in point here).
On the other hand the only real damage done has been the
unnecessary energy consumed. In the end everything important
will have to go through a series of type (1) votes.

In the current situation (1) clearly doesn't apply with Ian's 
document. If (2) does then he should let some of the more
prominent members here know, either openly on this list, or
offlist if he is shy about these things. I would certainly be
happy to give my support in these circumstances to something
suitably worded.

I would encourage everyone here to remember that we are probably
all learning how to do this, and mistakes are innevitable. On the
other hand I don't think we should pretend that mistakes haven't 
been made. It would be nice to find a way to draw a line under 
what has passed and move on.

      Matthew

&gt; Subject: Re: SUO: RE: Re: Violation of Process
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with Chris:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;As far as I can make out almost all of the main contributors 
&gt; to the list
&gt; &gt;have suggested that we need to find some way to include a 
&gt; variety of working
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;papers, including the Teknowledge (Daimler-Chrysler Merger) Paper.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm one of the people who voted in favor of Ian's document,
&gt; as long as it was considered a working paper.  The following
&gt; proposal is consistent with that view, and I would be happy
&gt; to endorse it:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; We declare the Teknowledge Merged
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ontology to be one of the documents being worked on by the 
&gt; Working Group
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (and Ian its editor).  Any member may post other documents 
&gt; to the list of
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; documents being worked on by this WG.  The member who 
&gt; posts the document
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; will be presumptively the editor or may name one by 
&gt; general consent of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the WG.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I don't believe that there is any need for any vote,
&gt; either pro or con on a working paper:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Objections will be resolved by a vote.  All documents will be
&gt; &gt;&gt; posted in the same place and enjoy the same status.  None will have
&gt; &gt;&gt; precedence over others.
&gt; 
&gt; The only reason for a vote would be to make a decision about
&gt; giving priority to one WP over another as a basis for a draft
&gt; SUO standard.  At this stage, such a vote would be premature.
&gt; 
&gt; My view is essentially the same as Chris's:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I certainly vote for this - in fact, I thought it had been 
&gt; all but agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, I think we should give Ian a hearty pat on the back
&gt; with the statement "Keep up the good work."  But at this stage,
&gt; that is all we can say:  it's a good contribution as a working
&gt; paper, but we still don't know exactly where, how, and if it
&gt; will fit into the overall goals for the SUO project.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't believe that we need to take any votes on what anybody
&gt; volunteers to do with a working paper.  In standard-speak,
&gt; Ian's merged ontology is an "expert contribution", which should
&gt; be assigned an appropriate identifier, such as SUO-WP-2001-001,
&gt; duly noted in the minutes, and placed on the SUO web site.
