&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my response to the criticism that we need to get clear
&gt; about foundations/methodology before proceeding to the development
&gt; of an actual ontology.  It seems to me that the 2,500 year history
&gt; of philosophy is a fairly powerful argument against this approach.
&gt; Although philosophy is a great source of stimulating debate and
&gt; theoretical insight, one would be hard-pressed to point to anything
&gt; on which a majority of philosophers agree.  Furthermore, I think that
&gt; theoretical discussion is most useful when it is grounded in a concrete
&gt; fabric within which this discussion has a context and an application.
&gt; I would argue that the best way of obtaining consensus is to produce
&gt; an initial document (no matter how flawed) and then to revise it
&gt; over many, many iterations of criticism and comment.

Ian,

I understand the sentiment that you are expressing here --
and maybe it seems like the perfect squelch brand of an
argument to you -- but the lion's share of its seemingly
persuasive rhetorical force relies on a peculiar definition
of philosophy that is just little bit self-satisfyingly skewed,
in the sense that just as soon as any bit of progress does arise
from out of what you lump all together as "foundations/methodology",
"philosophy", and "theory", well, then that particular outcome
gets removed from the sphere of the speculative and assigned
to the realm of some other, more concrete domain.  I have
heard people use exactly the same semblance of "argument"
to say that no AI problem ever gets solved, because its
solution depends on showing that it was really nothing
but "yet another programming problem" (YAPP) all along.

As it happens, some distinctly new results began
to come out of "philosophy" in the 19th century,
if you consider logic and pure mathematics as
parts of philosophy, as most people did and
still do, results without which we would
hardly be conversing in the fashion that
we are now, if you are indeed fond of
this variety of existential proofs.

So what do I reckon is bright, shiny, and new?
Well that is just what I am going to tell you!

In the line of thinking that I have studied the most,
there is the shining star of Charles S. Peirce, who,
for all of his attempts to emphasize the continuity
of his thinking with oftentimes forgotten thinkers
of the past, was really quite a distinctive brand
of thinker from anything that our planet had seen
before, and unfortunately since, that is to say,
he was the first genuinely "relational thinker"
that intellectual history records having seen.

There are three, bright shiny new things that
may be chalked up, in large part, to his work:

1.  A notation for the "logic of relatives" (LOR).
2.  A functional and "truly effective logic" (TEL).
3.  A prophecy of the "theory of information" (TOI).

Now I do not expect you to believe me without proof,
nor do I find that most folks are willing to rattle
their comfortable cages with the bother of looking
at the evidence, and so I will just tell you what
opinion I have formed from my study of the record.

But tomorrow -- this story makes me truly weary --
but it just one of those dirty jobs that any
dedicated archeologist of knowledge has to
get used to digging.

Till That Time,

Jon Awbrey
