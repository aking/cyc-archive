&gt; Hello all
&gt; 
&gt; Two days ago I started a thread entitled:
&gt; 
&gt; "Universal Time, other universals, and cultural context of SUO"
&gt; 
&gt; It thought this title was quite explicit, the little remark on use of UTC
&gt; being just an opportunity to raise more fundamental questions about eventual
&gt; "cultural biasis" of an enterprise having some pretentions towards
&gt; universality ...
&gt; 
&gt; The message was containing the following explicit set of questions:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt; If time scope of SUO community is US time, how far is cultural scope of
&gt; SUO extending beyond US culture and English language? How much of "upper"
&gt; concepts will be really "universal" and how much only pertinent in this "US
&gt; culture - English language" background? How many participants is this
&gt; community are non US natives and how many have another native language than
&gt; English? Are there Asiatic, African members? What about the alignment of SUO
&gt; with these other languages? &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; There were more than 20 messages since under the title of this thread. I
&gt; won't say 20 "answers", since none of those messages, as far as I understand
&gt; them, addresses directly any of the above questions, nor says explicitly
&gt; that they are non-sense or off-topic or already addressed in msg.nnnn. The
&gt; debate started instead on an expressed "intuition" of mine, that I had gave
&gt; just to present the view point from which I set the questions, not to answer
&gt; them, and then drifted towards the validity of the notion of "intuition" by
&gt; itself (BTW I share completely John Sowa's position about intuitions: only
&gt; more or less interesting hypotheses) ... cool debate, but having IMO direct
&gt; relationship with neither the title of the thread nor the questions set in
&gt; the original message.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm afraid this is not specific to this very thread, but seems to be an
&gt; heavy trend of this - and other - forums. I'm always amazed of how people
&gt; tend to drift in debates towards discussing some bit of peripheral viewpoint
&gt; they are personnaly interested in, than to address the question that was set
&gt; to begin with. Is it possible to avoid that pitfall? Is it difficult to
&gt; stick to the below simple communication clarity principles? I feel a bit
&gt; rude, as a newcomer to this list, to recall this principles, but here goes
&gt; :o)
&gt; 
&gt; Either I think that a thread subject is of interest, and stick to the
&gt; subject when I use its title.
&gt; Either I answer on the edge of the subject and drift to another one, and
&gt; then start a new thread, (indicating the original one).
&gt; Either I don't care about the thread subject, and abstain to comment just
&gt; for the fun of writing something witty. Everybody knows on that forum that
&gt; everybody (else) is very smart, and proving it again and again every day is
&gt; an overload of information and a waste of time for both authors and
&gt; readers - like that last remark is  :o))
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe I could have put this message under "Volume and Focus" after all ...
&gt; 
&gt; Regards

Bernard,

You now have your first bit of anthropological data
about the local culture of the island nation that
the locals in question call "SUO IS AN IS LAND",
and into which you have so haplessly wandered.
I hope that you are not going to be yet another
one of those missionary types who make the mistake
of trying to prescribe your ways to the inhabituants.
They tend to end up being thoroughly decanonabilized.

They denizens of this loci once had a mantra that
they chanted for many days and many nights on the
theme of -- what else? --:

| Excessive Volume Of Effort For Far Too Few Results
|
| <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg04456.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg04456.html</A>

What caused this outbreak of sutrification?  Well, I'll tell you.
Two or three fellows with nothing better to do one rainy weekend,
globally speaking, fell into a discussion of what was actually
a very pertinent matter, in their own minds, of course, and by
the time that they had got very far in hammering out the finer
points of their diverse and sundry opinions, which is about
the best that can be envisioned here, they had tributaried
many a de trop to the flood.  Comes the bright Monday
morning, and all the rest of people of the land wake
up aghast at the deluge of the others' delusion that
meets them when they open their windows.  Now, most
folks are polite, but one who is self-elected to
the august body impolitic fires a volley of rude
and obnoxious remarks, and, being self-elected,
who can question his authority but he, and he
never does, so far as I can see.  The fact
that these aspersions said nothing of any
substance, nor addressed that in their
hapless targets, made them impossible
to counteract on substantial grounds,
and so they went down as holey writ.
Whereupon an uproar was raised, and
the hue and cry of the e-flamed mob
sought in vain for a sacrifical goat.
Instead of commenting on the obvious
circumstance that some people had just
said what one person did not want to hear,
and that is all there really was to it, they
blamed the general volume in which they all live
as being the culprit and the perpetrator of their
unaccounted, but not literally unaccountable unease,
their affective distress and their cognitive dissonance.
You, with your anthropological and psychological insights,
recognize this phenomenon as a textbook case of "displacement",
blaming the weather, or whatever, for the undiscursable causality,
but this particular culture has yet to e-volve as far as ontologizing
themselves, that is to say, the contents and the conduct of their psyches,
and what they do not deign to ontologize, is quite simply not allowed to exist.

But I digress ...

After it had droned on for what seemed like an unbearable length of time,
I found myself led into the temptation of using a kleene star to abridge
its point, say in the form [Too Many Notes About]*, but by the time that
occurred to me the actual subject matter under the subject line had quite
magically mutated into something else entirely, of a character that I had
to admit to myself, albeit a bit grudgingly, might just grow up oneday to
be potentially constructive and even positively creative, so I decided
that it were a far better thing I do to simply let slipping dogmas lie.

| "Moral Of The Story" (MOTS):
|
|  When it comes to what e-volves from a
|  natural selection of random mutations,
|  you have to take the bad with the good.

Jon Awbrey
