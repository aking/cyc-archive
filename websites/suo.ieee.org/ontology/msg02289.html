Filament 1

Matthew,

I have removed the discussion of L0 and L1 to a separate
fiber? / filament? of this thread, keeping here the more
generic issues.  In the end, I hope that we will develop
a tutorial dialogue on this topic that may be of a wider
application, even if the question of what lesson it will
teach may yet be up in the air!

There were a few issues about "embedded", "indexed", "keyed",
or "ordered" relational tables that were initially raised in
the present frame, and so I will try to address them now, at
least until the running accumulation of bits grows too large.

JA:  Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
     I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
     any rational sense will come of arguing about any purported form of
     "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
     "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
     unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
     that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
     I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
     since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
     anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
     and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
     at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
     has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.

MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
     In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
     number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
     network of relations there is a path that links them together.

JA:  This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
     that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
     this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
     such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
     It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
     3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
     same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
     the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
     are many such special cases of relations, but their existence
     does not affect the general truth that many 3-adic relations
     are not of this kind.  And, once again, the logical forms of
     these very reductions involve 3-adic relations at every step
     of the corresponding analyses.

JA:  For example, contemplate the 3-adic
     relation that is expressed by the rheme
     "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- then ---",
     of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt;,
     and which one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:

|                        Jack
|                       o
|                      /
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
|                      \
|                       o
|                        Jill

JA:  Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
     of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
     where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.

JA:  The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
     of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
     is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
     of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
     suggest by means of the following scheme:

|                        Jack
|                [LP1]--o
|                 /      \
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12]
|                 \      /
|                [LP2]--o
|                        Jill

JA:  In this picture, the 2-adic relations LP1, LP2, and L12
     are defined to capture forms of pairwise relations like:

     LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2nd component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
                      y is the 2nd component
                      in some ordered pair.

JA:  Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
     defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
     it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:
 
     LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP2 (q, y).
 
JA:  This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
     that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
     all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
     if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
     There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
     2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
     composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
     have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.

MW:  I'm not concerned with "decomposable" in the sense you
     state here.  I am only concerned that if there is some
     triadic relation, is there some set of dyadic relations
     that contain (at least) the same information, i.e. the
     triadic relation can be constructed as a view on the
     dyadic relations.  One might refer to such a set of
     dyadic relations as a decomposition of the triadic
     relation, but not in the sense that you use the
     word above.

JA:  Just try to remember the "Golden Rule" (GR):

     | "Standardize Unto Others" (SUO) as you
     | would have others standardize unto you.

JA:  The words "de/composition", "de/composable",
     and their kin have been used in this way by
     fairly well-established communities of folk
     for many centuries of years, and so, even I,
     who has been peirced through and through to
     see that we also prolong the inevitable who
     standardize to wait on the ultimate ambigue,
     will try to respect the customs that people
     did bear on their shoulders, in their heads,
     all this time, and the longer, the regarder.

MW:  Fine, but obviously not communities that I belong to,
     which makes misunderstanding easy.

JA:  To name these domains:  "Q", "X", "Y" will do.
     Also, while I'm at it, allow me to convert my
     temporary terminology into what is more like
     the "standard-usage-onyms" where I come from.
     As a start, notice that the 2-adic relations
     LP1 and LP2 are actually functions from the
     domain of q to the domains of x and y,
     respectively.

JA:  In recognition of this fact, it is usual to give them
     functional names, commonly something like the following
     reformulations of the definitions:

     1.  Proj&lt;1&gt; : XxY -&gt; X such that Proj&lt;1&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; x.
     2.  Proj&lt;2&gt; : XxY -&gt; Y such that Proj&lt;2&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; y.

JA:  The point is that we do not so much eliminate 3-adic relations,
     as push them down into a tighter corner of their broader realm,
     as we do when we analyze a 3-adic relation into a more or less
     complex composition -- I believe I am speaking strictly here --
     of many 2-adics relations and functions and hopefully just
     a few final 3-adic relations, of the sort that we know and
     love and signify as "truth-functional connectives".

MW:  Assuming one accepts truth functional connectives
     as triadic (if they are that's OK, but I need to
     get there first).

JA:  All binary operations are triadic relations --
     and you can look it up.

JA:  Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L0 and L1
     is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
     At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
     and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
     along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.

JA:  What we have just now established, a little ways above,
     is that an ordered pair q is determined by this "data":
     a couple of 2-adic relations, in particular, functions,
     whose names are not of any great importance, but which
     I am now calling the "projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; amd Proj&lt;2&gt;,
     together with the values of q's projections in X and Y.

JA:  All I have done here is to change the names
     and the forms of application of your 2-adic
     "role" relations to ones that are a bit more
     appropriate to what they actually are, namely,
     functions from some domain to some codomain --
     after all, it is in the interests of the overall
     computational economy, not to mention conceptual
     parsimony, to recognize a function when we see one.

MW:  OK, I think I'm with you, but I am specifying the 
     coordinates of a component within a relation rather
     than the projection of it onto some co-ordinates.
     So if you like I am making the point an object,
     and then saying separately what its x, y, and z
     co-ordinates are.

JA:  Are you using the word "relation" for a tuple again?
     If so, this is just bound to keep confusing the issue.

JA:  The point is already an object.
     What you are doing is giving it
     another name, an index or a key,
     but this new name is redundant,
     since the coordinates are already
     perfectly definitve of this point.

JA:  You can do this if you want, but what you are doing
     is called "embedding" the initial k-adic relation in
     a (k+1)-adic relation and then somehow trying to say
     that the extra column does not count against the tab
     of the arity that you are actually using.  It counts.
     Information-wise it gets billed to your account, and
     it cannot be discounted just because you wish it away.
     Of course, a person can do all sorts of magical things
     with these "pretend 2-adics" that are really 3-adics.
 
JA:  Here is a sort of picture that can be useful in helping us
     to remember what is essential in this kind of a relational
     situation, beneath the vast bewildering array of notations:

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o       q   o
|   x7 o     / \ o y7
|    x6 o   /   * y6
|     x5 o /   o y5
|      x4 *   o y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.

JA:  It is just a 2-dimensional cartesian coordinate framework,
     with the sleight modification of being rotated 45 degrees.
     Here is a more "standard upright organization" of the bit:

|      X
|      ^
|      |
|   x7 o
|      |
|   x6 o
|      |
|   x5 o
|      |
|   x5 o
|      |
|   x4 o
|      |                          &lt;x3, y5&gt;
|   x3 o &lt;---------------------------q
|      |                             |
|   x2 o                             |
|      |                             |
|   x1 o                             |
|      |                             v
|      +-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----&gt; Y
|            y1    y2    y3    y4    y5    y6    y7

This illustrates the property that defines the 2-tuple q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;,
namely, its being determined by the values of its coordinate projections:

     Proj&lt;1&gt;(q)  =  Proj&lt;1&gt;(&lt;x3, y5&gt;)  =  x3.
     Proj&lt;2&gt;(q)  =  Proj&lt;2&gt;(&lt;x3, y5&gt;)  =  y5.

In programming languages that support a "functional" style,
structured data objects, like k-tuples, are always defined
by means of converse families of such functions, typically
called "constructors" and "selectors", respectively, of the
abstract data structure in question, for example, the series
of k-tuple building operators that we have yet to discuss here,
along with their associated sets of j^th coordinate projections,
Pro&lt;j&gt;, for j = 1 to k.

I have not looked, but I have the feeling that a lot of this stuff
is probably discussed somewhere or another in the vast link-o-rama
of tutorial materials that John Sowa has supplied for our use here.

JA:  So what if we add another character, yclept "p", let us say,
     to this little drama of relations that we have set out here?

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o   p   q   o
|   x7 o / \ / \ o y7
|    x6 *   .   * y6
|     x5 o / \ o y5
|      x4 *   * y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that p = &lt;x5, y3&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(p) = x5, Proj&lt;2&gt;(p) = y3,
| that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.

JA:  We are now looking at a non-trivial 2-adic relation,
     that is, one that has more than one 2-tuple to its name.
     Speaking of which, it has none yet, so let's give it the
     moniker "M&lt;35&gt;", mnemonically, say, for "Move 3 &lt;-&gt; 5".

JA:  Now, one of the interesting things that we can do with
     the "coordinate projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; and Proj&lt;2&gt; is to
     extend their definitions from single points or tuples
     to entire relations, comprising many points or tuples.

JA:  Definition.
     For the 2-adic relation L c X x Y, and Proj&lt;j&gt;, j = 1, 2,
     the "projection of L on the j^th axis (or the j^th domain)"
     is defined as:

     Proj&lt;j&gt;(L)  =  {Proj&lt;j&gt;(e) : e in L}.

JA:  Thus, in the present example:

     1.  Proj&lt;1&gt;(M&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;1&gt;(p), Proj&lt;1&gt;(q)}

                         =  {x3, x5}  c  X.

     2.  Proj&lt;2&gt;(M&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;2&gt;(p), Proj&lt;2&gt;(q)}

                         =  {y3, y5}  c  Y.

JA:  Well, that was such fun that I'm tempted to try another one.
     Let us then contemplate another non-trivial 2-adic relation:

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o   r   o
|      o   / \   o
|     o   /   \   o
|   x7 o /     \ o y7
|    x6 *   s   * y6
|     x5 o / \ o y5
|      x4 *   * y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that r = &lt;x5, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(r) = x5, Proj&lt;2&gt;(r) = y5,
| that s = &lt;x3, y3&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(s) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(s) = y3.

JA:  Let us dub this one as "L&lt;35&gt;", say, on the basis
     of a likely graphical analogy, for "Loop 3 and 5".

JA:  Computing the projections for this example:

     1.  Proj&lt;1&gt;(L&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;1&gt;(r), Proj&lt;1&gt;(s)}

                         =  {x3, x5}  c  X.

     2.  Proj&lt;2&gt;(L&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;2&gt;(r), Proj&lt;2&gt;(s)}

                         =  {y3, y5}  c  Y.

JA:  Thus this renders it beyond the shadow of a doubt,
     if it was not already evident from their mugshots,
     that L&lt;35&gt; &amp; M&lt;35&gt; have the very same projections.

JA:  So, what have we learned from this state of affairs?
     Just that, even though single tuples are determined
     by their projection data, that relations themselves,
     generally speaking, are not.

JA:  I think that this is something to think about.

MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
     for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
     that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
     then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
     statement about how I see relations.

MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
     They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
     infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
     combinations of things, and then I see a further
     infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
     ourselves to those where all the members of the
     set have the same adacity).

MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of
     them, but to a very small subset we choose (note the word
     choose) to map our experiences of the world to in terms of
     connections (broad sense) that we see between things.

MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the
     world and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how
     to do it).  I'm not sure you share that view.

Perhaps you have noted one of the favored formulas that
I frequently use to close up my notes:  "Many Regards"?
But I'm not so radical a pluralist or a relativist that
I can fantasize every perspective to succeed in its aim.

MW:  I would suggest that we talked more about what was being 
     represented rather than how it was being represented.
     I suspect that we would then find more to agree about.

JA:  I am afraid that we can only talk about things
     in so far as we represent them.

MW:  So I can only talk about an activity as a relation
     if that is how I represent it?  I don't think so.

JA:  Huh?  'When' you talk about an activity 'as' a relation,
     that is to say, as you have just said, 'qua' a relation,
     then you are, ipso facto, representing it as a relation.

MW:  Correct, my slopiness.

JA:  At any rate, since I 'was' listening to what I said,
     as I was talking to myself when I wrote that to you,
     I know that I said 'in so far as', which leaves the
     'qua' of the 'as' as an open variable, TBA, later.

JA:  Thus it is implicit in the reading, and it is commonly understood --
     you do not have to take the author's word for his intent, I guess,
     but if you query your average population of anglophone informants
     I think that it will turn out to be as I say -- that the sentence:

     | I am afraid that we can only talk about things
     | in so far as we represent them.

     is understood as:

     | I am afraid that we can only talk about things
     | in so far as we represent them (in some way).

JA:  The bit about representing "activity 'as' relation"
     was thy ipse dixit, not mine.  That is, of course,
     a very apt suggestion, but it is only one option
     among many, and it was up to you to choose it.

MW:  Oh good.  I hadn't had this so clearly from you.
     So there are multiple possible represenations of
     things like activities and some might be tuples
     and some might not be, any of which may be useful
     for some purpose.

MW:  To hear you "talk" I had gained the impression
     that you considered that some things could only
     possibly be represented by triadic relations.

JA:  I do not think that I have ever denied the existence
     of things that are adequately modeled in dyadic form.

     And yet:

     Many things of interest can be reasonably facsimiled
     only through the mathematical modeling facilities of
     triadic relations, things like learning or reasoning
     or thinking activities, just a few that come to mind.

The point is just that we finite information creatures,
presented with any interesting or significant reality,
are just bound to use some sort of approximation to
address, approach, depict, discuss, represent, or
even think about it.  But not all approximations
are "up to the res", to adapt a time-worn phrase.

This looks like a good place to break up the file,
so I will.
