(This is reply is quite delayed because of interruptions.  Still, I wanted
to get on the record.)

Pat,

We (probably) aren't as far apart as I thought.  See embedded comments
below.

Regards,

John Velman

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I've snipped most of the following, and left only the snippet I want to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;comment on
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;just now.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It seems to me that it is fundamental that things don't have locations.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;They only
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;have locations _relative_ to other things.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Why do you think so? This idea doesn't conform to normal geographical
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I guess this highlights two different senses of "where"  (a "where"
&gt;function
&gt;&gt;was proposed in the part of previous message that I edited out.)  Or
&gt;&gt;perhaps to my use of the  word "location"  (the context that I didn't snip
&gt;&gt;out refered to a function from things to their locations).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Why do I think so?   Because of many years of starting an analysis with
&gt;&gt;words to the effect: "Assume a coordinate frame with origin at the center
&gt;&gt;of the earth, X axis oriented positively toward the vernal equinox..", or
&gt;&gt;"Coordinates are given relative to the Clarke Ellipsoid of 1866 ".  In
&gt;&gt;other words, specifying the locations of things relative to some agreed
&gt;&gt;upon identifiable standard (although only specified with the precision
&gt;&gt;necessary for the purpose).
&gt;
&gt;Ah, yes: but reference to a coordinate frame precisely ISNT reference
&gt;to another "thing". Is it? (If you think so, then I simply
&gt;misunderstood you, and withdraw my comment. )

Ahhh!   I was guilty both of sloppy thinking and sloppy expression of my
thinking.  Here is a rough (but hopefully better) expression of where I
seem to stand :-)

I think coordinate systems are abstract (but are encoded in physical
objects in some way, in order to be useful).  However, I think coordinate
systems themselves are, let me say, "anchored" by identifiable aspects of
physical things.  So when I said that "it is fundamental that things don't
have locations.  They only have locations _relative_ to other things." I
was speaking very loosely (blush), and the dependence may be rather
indirect through a chain of abstractions.

I know this is stated roughly, and is going to take some time to work out.
Probably should be deferred till we start dealing seriously with
measurements and coordinate systems.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;On the other hand,  your reference to geographical intuition is a clue to
&gt;&gt;another sense, I guess.  "Where is Taksim Square?"  "In Istanbul."   I'm
&gt;&gt;not so sure, however, that it is possible to specify where something is
&gt;&gt;_except_ in terms of its spacial relationship to something else, either
&gt;&gt;explicitly or implicitly.  ("Where is Istanbul?  On the Bosphorus.  Where
&gt;&gt;is the Bosphorus?  Between the Black Sea and the Sea of Maramara, a long
&gt;&gt;ways from California.")  Perhaps my geographic intuition has been spoiled
&gt;&gt;over the years.   Or perhaps I'm still missing your point.
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking precisely of the use of coordinate frames, rather than
&gt;dead-reckoning locations from 'landmarks, as being counter to your
&gt;claim.

Yes.  See above on coordinate systems.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;intuition, it isn't supported by Newtonian physics and it isn't even
&gt;&gt; &gt;strictly true in General Relativity. I believe the only person who
&gt;&gt; &gt;seriously believed this was Ernst Mach.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is also a puzzle.  As far as I recall, Mach claimed that inertial
&gt;&gt;properties of matter were due to the distribution of mass in the universe
&gt;&gt;(roughly speaking).
&gt;
&gt;Right, so location is defined by reference to *things* (with mass,
&gt;and rather a lot of them, but things for all that.) Mach believed
&gt;that there would be no inertia in an empty universe, contra Newton
&gt;(for whom absolute location was simply a property of space).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Inertial properties have to do with accelerations, not
&gt;&gt;with absolute locations.
&gt;
&gt;But in Newtonian mechanics, acceleration is defined to be the second
&gt;temporal derivative of (absolute) location. A single particle in an
&gt;otherwise empty universe can still be accelerated, which is *why* it
&gt;will feel inertia. So empty space has to be 'real', which indeed
&gt;Newton admitted was very puzzling.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Both the mass distribution in the universe, and
&gt;&gt;accelerations of individual bodies are properties concerning relative
&gt;&gt;locations.  Of course Newton thought space was absolute in the sense of
&gt;&gt;inertial properties of matter.  But I don't think his spinning bucket
&gt;&gt;experiment has anything to do with locations per se.  If you have a
&gt;&gt;reference otherwise, I'd be most grateful.
&gt;
&gt;I believe Newton himself used it as an argument for the absolute
&gt;nature of space, did he not? I think the argument is in Principia, in
&gt;fact, but I don't have the page reference. The distinction between
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Nor do I.  I only know this
as reported in textbooks and other recent writings.

&gt;space as location and space as the vessel for inertial properties is
&gt;(I think) a more modern reconstruction; but I may be out of my
&gt;historical depth here.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;As I recall, general relativity implies frame dragging, and some other
&gt;&gt;things that go a little way toward Mach's principle, but not all the way.
&gt;
&gt;GR refers gravity to essentially geometric properties of
&gt;spati(otempor)al coordinates rather than to relative locations of
&gt;other material things. That was widely cited as its chief beauty over

But interestingly, the geometric properties depend on the distribution of
physical things.

&gt;Newtonian 'action at a distance', I gather. There is no action at a
&gt;distance in GR; things just go along minimum-action paths, determined
&gt;locally by the locally curved spacetime.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I also recall that Einstein relied extensively on simultaneity (as John
&gt;&gt;Sowa's <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm</A>  reminded us).
&gt;&gt;This clearly depends on a relationship between two events in space-time.
&gt;
&gt;Those are used in his intuitive account of special relativity, which
&gt;is indeed wonderfully convincing. But the point there is really only
&gt;to infer the equations of the coordiante transformations. Once those
&gt;are determined, there is no need to then refer all measurements to
&gt;other events or other 'things': space-time itself has a geometry.
&gt;(However, as Ive emphasised before, space-time with the Minkowski
&gt;metric is a very different beast from the nice orthogonal Newtonian
&gt;4-d spacetime that Matthew West and I like to use for ontological
&gt;reasoning. I really don't think we should base a practical ontology
&gt;on Minkowski space; I don't want to have to be always thinking about

But we may have to provide room for it.  I recall thinking some time ago
that the modeling the problem of communicating between two "far apart"
objects with laser beams was easier to formulate in spacetime with the
Minkowski metric.  I don't recall if it was really easier, or whether it
was just a tool I wanted to learn to use.

&gt;Lorentz contractions.)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Perhaps I'm looking at things in a totally different  way than you
&gt;&gt;are, but I can't see how one can talk about the location of one thing
&gt;&gt;without at least implicitly referring it to another thing (or event, in 4
&gt;&gt;D).
&gt;
&gt;Well, look at Einstein's equations.
