Dear Pat,

&gt; 
&gt; Matthew --
&gt;    Thanks for the clarification:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The port engine on a plane is an example of an object that 
&gt; &gt; can have periods of non-existence. When one engine is 
&gt; &gt; removed for maintenance, and replaced by another. 
&gt; &gt; However, your description of Pat's intent is sufficiently
&gt; &gt; unconstrained to cover that case.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;    This is an important issue, and I will provide my
&gt; current thoughts on it.
&gt;    This phenomenon is not one I would represent as being
&gt; some form of intermittent "concrete_existence".  I would reserve 
&gt; "concrete_existence" for individual objects.  

MW: In my book the port engine of my plane (I wish) is an individual.

&gt; A specification of the
&gt; parts for some artefact, or prototypical natural object, is a 
&gt; definition
&gt; of some class of objects, which a particular object in the real world 
&gt; may or may not conform to.  

MW: Of course the set which you refer to here exists as well, but it is not
what I am referring to. I am referring to the port engine I can touch.

&gt; To be consistent, I think such definitions
&gt; need to refer to prototypes or "complete" objects.  The individual 
&gt; parts may be classified as "vital", "essential" "typical", "optional",
&gt; "disjoint-alternate", or "accessory" -- for example.  The 
&gt; assertions of 
&gt; the "presence" or "absence" of some designed part of an artefact at 
&gt; some particular time and place, whether it is connected as 
&gt; intended in 
&gt; the design, and whether it is functional, are time-dependent 
&gt; assertions 
&gt; about specific instances of objects that don't change the 
&gt; definition of 
&gt; the complete artefact.   

MW: This is just one viewpoint on what is going on. I would say that there
are states of particular jet engines that are co-extensive with states of
the port engine of my plane.

&gt; A particular artefact that can serve 
&gt; the role of
&gt; a part of a plane may or may not be designated as "belonging"
&gt; to some particular plane (e.g. while being repaired), which is 
&gt; not the same as saying that it is "in-place" and 
&gt; "functional".  I would
&gt; view these latter three assertions as time-dependent slots 
&gt; (or axioms) 
&gt; on the specific instance of a part itself.

MW: This is just another relation a particular engine can have to my plane,
and even my planes port engine.

&gt;    Assuming that some instance of an artefact such as a plane is 
&gt; sufficiently intact to be termed a plane, even though incomplete, it 
&gt; should have time-dependent attributes such as "complete", or 
&gt; "functional".  

MW: I consider time dependent attributes to be indicative of states of
something.

&gt; If "incomplete" there will be some list of parts that 
&gt; are "missing".  Whether an artefact can be pulled apart and 
&gt; cease its "existence" and then be re-assembled and said
&gt; to exist again under the same instance-name is a convention that
&gt; depends on "identity criteria", which Guarino has labored much
&gt; to clarify.  If there is some single vital part (fuselage?)
&gt; which by convention defines whether some object exists or not, 
&gt; regardless of the presence of other parts, then intermittent 
&gt; existence should not occur; the "incomplete" artefact would exist
&gt; as soon as the vital part came into existence, and cease to exist 
&gt; when that vital part ceased to exist (and recursively for the
&gt; "vital part").  Alternatively, existence could be said to begin only 
&gt; when some artefact has achieved functionality at some time, and 
&gt; subsequent existence might be defined as being existence of the 
&gt; vital part.

MW: I agree that "what" you choose to be the identity criteria is arbitrary,
and different people can make different choices about what they are
interested in. This can be a cause of so called fuzziness.

&gt;     This may not seem to conform to intuitive or linguistic
&gt; usage, but linguistic usage is fairly broad.  I've heard people 
&gt; say, e.g., that "John's car is scattered all over his driveway.  He's 
&gt; getting the heads planed."  The existence of John's car is not
&gt; questioned in such a case, but its physical state of division 
&gt; certainly
&gt; doesn't conform to a definition of a prototypical connected and
&gt; functional object.  

MW: An object does not have to have current existence to be able to refer to
it. I can refer to Winston Churchill, who no longer exists, and I can refer
to my holiday next year which does not yet have existence.

&gt; I'd be interested to learn what you think
&gt; is the best way to represent all the possible permutations of
&gt; parts, including multiple alternative replacements, even sticking
&gt; only to artefacts.

MW: I do spatio-temporal analysis to find the life-cycle patterns of the
different objects, relations and the classes they are members of. After that
it is a matter of what you are interested in. If you would care to give a
specific example we could examine it.

The long answer is that the STEP community has developed (I guess) about
20,000 pages of standards on how to represent engineering data in ISO 10303
- Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 13584 - Parts
Libraries, ISO 15531 - Manufacturing Management Data, ISO 15926 Data
Integration for Process Plant facilities including Oil and Gas, ISO 18876 -
Integration of Industrial Data for Exchange Access and Sharing.

These have shown interest in a number of types of relationship between
"parts" and possible parts, and versions etc.
