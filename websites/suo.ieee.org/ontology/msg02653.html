</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial><B>Project scope:</B> This standard will 
specify an <FONT color=red>upper ontology</FONT> that will enable computers to 
utilize it for applications such as data interoperability, information search 
and retrieval, automated inferencing, and natural language processing. An 
ontology is similar to a dictionary or glossary, but with greater detail and 
structure that enables computers to process its content. An ontology consists of 
a set of concepts, axioms, and relationships that describe a domain of interest. 
An <FONT color=red>upper ontology</FONT> is limited to concepts that are meta, 
generic, abstract and philosophical, and therefore are general enough to address 
(at a high level) a broad range of domain areas. Concepts specific to given 
domains will not be included; however, this standard will provide a structure 
and a set of general concepts upon which domain ontologies (e.g. medical, 
financial, engineering, etc.) could be constructed. </FONT></FONT></P><FONT 
size=2><FONT face=Arial>
<P><B>Project purpose:</B> A. AUTOMATED REASONING: The standard will be suitable 
for automated logical inference to support knowledge-based reasoning 
applications. B. INTER-OPERABILITY: The standard will provide a basis for 
achieving Inter-Operability among various software and database applications. 1) 
Application developers can define new data elements in terms of a common 
ontology, and thereby gain some degree of interoperability with other conformant 
systems. 2) Applications based on domain-specific ontologies that are compliant 
with this standard will be able to interoperate (to some degree) by virtue of 
the shared common terms and definitions. 3) The SUO will play the role of a 
neutral interchange format whereby owners of existing applications will be able 
to map existing data elements just once to a common ontology. This provides a 
degree of interoperability with other applications whose representations conform 
to SUO. This entails the SUO being able to be mapped to more restricted forms 
such as XML, database schema, or object oriented schema. C: APPLICATION AREAS 1) 
E-commerce applications from different domains that need to interoperate at both 
the data and semantic levels. 2) Educational applications in which students 
learn concepts and relationships directly from, or expressed in terms of, a 
common ontology. This will also enable a standard record of learning to be kept. 
3) Natural language understanding tasks in which a knowledge-based reasoning 
system uses the ontology to disambiguate among likely interpretations of natural 
language statements. <BR><SPAN class=060143509-20052001></SPAN></P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>Pat said " Ah, I misunderstood you. That idea is KR, true, but 
    it was invented<BR>in KR independently of the linguistic input. It is indeed 
    interesting<BR>that NL seems to utilise this kind of structure, let me say, 
    and this<BR>fact is an interesting datum; but even here, the exact kind 
    of<BR>'roles' that one gets from NL do not correspond in detail to 
    the<BR>'roles' (this term is linguistic, so may warp the discusion if 
    not<BR>scarequoted) that arise when one takes a more objectively 
    ontological<BR>perspective. Many properties of events have no explicit 
    linguistic<BR>markers, so are simply ignored by linguistic analysis: if 
    there is no<BR>case role or prepositions for it, a linguist will not even 
    consider<BR>it."<BR><BR>It depends on what you call a linguist. I agree that 
    Hans Kamp looks at matters too much from a linguistic viewpoint only. But 
    I'm pretty sure that a computational linguist working on deep semantics does 
    take all aspects into account. <BR><?/smaller></BLOCKQUOTE><?smaller><BR><BR>I 
  am quite sure than no computational linguist takes all ontological matters 
  into account. (Some cognitive psychologists, working in psycholinguistics, 
  maybe: but even then I doubt it.) The point being that there are many 
  ontological issues (to do with individuation, representation of time, of 
  physical states, of geometry, and so on, and centrally ontological issues like 
  whether or not to think of physical entities in mereological terms) which 
  either simply do not arise in linguistics (even computational linguistics) or 
  else do arise, but which natural language - which evolved for situated 
  communication between human beings, not as a representational langauge for 
  ontological use - has particular mechanisms for which are basically unsuitable 
  for ontological use (I am thinking in particular of tense for representing 
  time, and modality for representing rigidity, both of which have been an 
  actively harmful distortion of good ontological practice which we have seen on 
  these lists, which arise from a mistaken importing of NL devices and 
  intuitions into the ontological realm.)<BR><BR>Ontology is more like Fodor's 
  'language of thought' than it is like NL. And of course the language of 
  thought is not a natural language. If it were, NL comprehension would be 
  trivial: just read in the NL sentences and store them. <BR><BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The opposite is - unfortunatelly - true as well: many 
    "ontologists" don't care at all about the properties of events (or entities 
    in general) that are explicitly marked in language. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>I 
  think you will find that in these cases, the ontologists are deliberately 
  disregarding the linguistic markers not through blindness, but because they 
  beleive them to be actively misleading. (See my earlier email with excerpts 
  from correspondence with Piek Vossen and Livia Polyani, for example, which is 
  typical of many encounters I have had with computational linguists.) There is 
  a basic and fundamental misunderstanding here, in my view: the idea that 
  natural langauge and ontological formalisms are on some kind of continuum. If 
  you look at the requirements they must satisfy, it is clear that they are in 
  completely different functional spaces, and that the requirements on them are 
  all in completely opposite directions For example:. NL needs to be 
  informationally compact but can be highly ambiguous and contextual; NL 
  utterances are often abbreviated, gnomic, or incomplete. NL is a language for 
  communciation rather than representation; it does not need to support 
  inference. It is rich with indexical and deictic markers and constructions, 
  and intended to be understood in a surrounding context by creatures with 
  sensory abilities which need to be sharply aware of the processing and 
  epistemic abilities of the other creatures in their vicinity. It uses social 
  mechanisms like humor, repetition, emotional content, irony, and so on. It 
  mixes propositional utterances with commands, requests, questions and other 
  speech acts; it uses narrative and tensed and rhetorical forms and God knows 
  what else, It does not need to have a precise model theory or even a precisely 
  defined syntax. None of this is true for ontological formalisms, which need to 
  be at the opposite end of all these dimensions. Maybe most important, ontology 
  langauges need to be able to represent all the stuff the is *never* said in NL 
  because the users of NL always assume that the listener already knows it: all 
  the unspoken knowledge of the world (including the stuff I once called 'naive 
  physics', but also naive psychology, epistemology, sociology and so 
  on.)<BR><BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>The resulting ontologies may then turn out to be unuseful for NL 
    understanding. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Indeed. So what?. I would suggest that 
  anyone whose primary interest in NL processing move to a different mailing 
  list. This one is about ontology design. We also don't discuss the weather in 
  Turkestan, for example.<BR><BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>Too often people claim that ontologies should be "language 
    independent". But there is a big difference in being independent from 
    specific languages (French, English, ...) or being independent from natural 
    language as a medium of communication in general. The same people (I mean 
    the language ignoring ontologists) claim that once the "pure" ontology is 
    developed, it "just" takes a little additional effort to link it to NL 
    applications.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>I would not claim that. I am simply 
  uninterested in NL applications, and do not regard them as centrally 
  important. I think they will become less important as time goes by, in fact, 
  as more people get used to working directly with ontologies on the Web, for 
  example. I see no particular reason why ontology should pay particular 
  attention to NL, NL work is one potential application, but it is not by any 
  means the primary or most interesting one. Indeed it seems to me to be a very 
  peripheral one, and becoming more peripheral all the time. I can forsee a 
  bright future for ontology development without involving NL at all.<BR><BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>My experience is just the opposite.<BR><BR>A key point in any 
    development is to know for what reason and by what animals the ontology will 
    be used. If it is just for communication between machines, you can forget 
    about the language aspects. But I guess that all machines are working for 
    the benefit of humans, and hence, communication with humans is unavoidable. 
    <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Humans have many alternative ways to interact with 
  machines than by the use of NL. I doubt that full NL comprehension will *ever* 
  be a useful communication medium between humans and machines, in fact. 
  (Limited comprehension may well be of use, as it is already.)<BR><BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>And if we want to get away with the poor point and click 
    interfaces of today, language will come into play, 
  <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Language already comes into play. But not full-blown 
  natural language.<BR><BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>and ontologies must be able to account for 
  that.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><?/smaller>You might be right about this. Only time 
  will tell. I will be willing to get on with other, more productive, uses in 
  the meantime, however.<BR><BR>Pat Hayes
