John,
   I'm all for good technology solutions but isn't the easiest solution 
just to have folks use the other lists that we've set up?  There's been a 
rather large number of postings recently on Piercian scholarship that, 
while interesting, properly belong on ontology@ieee.org.  If that topic 
alone were moved over to the other list, we'd see a substantial shift in 
volume.  Since you are an acknowledged authority on that topic, I suspect 
that if you lead by example, others will follow.

&gt;The enormous volume of messages to the SUO list has forced many
&gt;people to unsubscribe to SUO because they cannot afford the time
&gt;to wade through all the messages.  Various people have suggested
&gt;solutions such as setting up multiple mailing lists, but that hasn't
&gt;seemed to work.
&gt;
&gt;Another solution is to switch to a newsletter or web-zine format,
&gt;which has proved to be successful for a large number of special
&gt;interest groups.  Recently, version 2.0 of the Slash code -- software
&gt;that is used to support the Slashdot web site and several smaller sites,
&gt;has been released under the Gnu GPL license.  Following is the web
&gt;site where the code and documentation are available:
&gt;
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://slashcode.com/">http://slashcode.com/</A>
&gt;
&gt;At the end of this note are some excerpts from the README page
&gt;for the Slash code.
&gt;
&gt;Slash is designed to support a home page that contains multiple
&gt;headlines for each thread, followed by a paragraph that gives
&gt;an abstract or summary of the thread.  Then for each thread, there's
&gt;another page which contains the body of that story, article, or
&gt;whatever.  Following that are an open-ended number of comments to
&gt;which anyone is welcome to contribute.
&gt;
&gt;For those people who have never seen the Slashdot web site, see
&gt;
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">http://www.slashdot.org/</A>
&gt;
&gt;This is the default format, but the colors, icons, headings, etc.,
&gt;can be freely customized for any subject matter.
&gt;
&gt;The Slashdot policy is to give a small number of people the option
&gt;of posting new "stories" to the main page, but anyone can freely add
&gt;new comments to the threads for any story.  For the SUO, that policy
&gt;could be adapted to allow any voting member to post a new story,
&gt;while anyone could add comments to the threads.
&gt;
&gt;This approach has several advantages over an email message system:
&gt;
&gt;  1. No mailbox clutter.  Nothing appears in the readers' mailbox
&gt;     at any time, no matter how many stories, threads, or comments
&gt;     are posted.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Anyone in the world is free to look at the main page to see what
&gt;     stories have been posted and to add any comments to the follow-up
&gt;     web pages.
&gt;
&gt;  3. Voting members can post new stories at any time, with abstracts
&gt;     on the main page and an arbitrarily long article on the follow-up
&gt;     page.  They are also welcome to comment and reply to their own
&gt;     articles or anybody else's articles.
&gt;
&gt;  4. All comments are organized by thread, and anyone can navigate
&gt;     through them very easily and add comments by typing anything in
&gt;     a comment box at the end of the page.  (Pointers to other sites,
&gt;     diagrams, or other articles can be included in any comment.)
&gt;
&gt;  5. There would be no need to repeat the full text of every previous
&gt;     comment in new comments, since all comments would be displayed
&gt;     on the same page.  It would be easy for any reader to move the
&gt;     browser up or down to look at previous comments or the main story
&gt;     that they refer to.
&gt;
&gt;  6. Sidebars on the home page can have pointers to related information,
&gt;     such as glossaries, rules and regulations, pending issues to be
&gt;     voted on, whitepapers, draft standard proposals, or whatever else
&gt;     may be considered of interest to the voting members, prospective
&gt;     members, or visitors to the web site.
&gt;
&gt;  7. Old stories, threads, and comments are automatically archived.
&gt;     The moderator can establish a policy for how long any story
&gt;     remains on the home page.  Slashdot leaves stories on the home
&gt;     page for 24 hours, but the SUO site might leave them on the
&gt;     home page for a week or more.  Popular, long-running stories,
&gt;     could be moved to the archive, but with a pointer from a sidebar
&gt;     on the home page.
&gt;
&gt;The Slash code is written in Perl, and somebody with Perl experience
&gt;would have to volunteer to look at the code, install it on the IEEE
&gt;server, customize it for the SUO, and do whatever maintenance or
&gt;updates might be needed from time to time.
&gt;
&gt;Following are some excerpts from the Slashcode web site.  I'm also
&gt;cc'ing this note to CG list.  Although the CG list doesn't have as
&gt;high a volume as the SUO list, some such software might be considered
&gt;for CG list as well.

&gt;_________________________________________________________________________
&gt;
&gt;Slash -- Slashdot Like Automated Storytelling Homepage -- is the code
&gt;that runs Slashdot. More than that, however, Slash is an architecture
&gt;for putting together web sites. It comes with functionality for posting
&gt;articles, conducting polls, having discussions, and more. But it can be
&gt;extended in innumerable ways.
&gt;
&gt;Slash is written in Perl, and is built on top of Apache and mod_perl.
&gt;It requires a database backend, though the only well-supported database
&gt;used with it is MySQL (more databases will become well-supported as
&gt;time goes on; PostgreSQL support is already well on its way). Slash is
&gt;fast, scalable, and secure (as evidenced by one of the best test cases
&gt;you could have, running Slashdot itself).
&gt;
&gt;Through a plugin system, developers can add functionality to Slash.
&gt;Through themes and templates (which are written using Template Toolkit),
&gt;the look and feel of a Slash site can be customized.
&gt;
&gt;See INSTALL for information about installing Slash, including hardware
&gt;and software requirements. Read that document carefully, and follow the
&gt;instructions as precisely as possible.
&gt;
&gt;Slash is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
&gt;the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
&gt;Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
&gt;any later version.
