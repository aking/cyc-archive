Thanks for pressing me on this, Robert.  I think I see the source of the
confusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nothing in the axioms entails that there is a null class.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This is false, of course.  According to the axioms, every class has a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;complement, hence (complement top) is null.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ### No woman overboard, but note one can only prove this from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; axioms if both top and null are known to be unique. There is as yet no
&gt; &gt; &gt; axiom or meta axiom to this effect (nor is it provable of course).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I think you are confusing the property *null* (i.e., the property of
&gt; &gt;having no instances) with the class *nil*, Robert.
&gt;
&gt; ### I am sure you are right, Chris. The confusion remains however after
&gt; this reply --actually it is greater, since neitehr the ontology nor my
&gt; query contain the notion of "property"...

A property (and hence, in the ontology, a class) is a 1-place relation;
sorry, this is such common terminology in my world that I didn't think
to make it explicit, which would have been a good idea.  However, there
is at least an allusion to this usage of "property" in the informal
exposition:

;; ... if we want to attribute some property to
;; Cain's father, it is convenient to use functional notation:
;;
;;                 (gardener (father-of cain))

I.e., the property of being a gardener is being attributed to the father
of Cain.

&gt; ...and the ontology only uses "nil" in the context of a null sequence.

Whoops, that was a boneheaded mistake on my part; I forgot my own
terminology: "null" is the name of our distinguished (NOT to say unique)
null class; as a class -- i.e., property -- it also has instances, viz.,
all the classes that have no instances.  "nil", as you note, is the name
of the empty sequence.

&gt; Maybe I'm not alone with in this state of confusion.

Of which my blunder is at least a partial cause.  Sorry about that.
With this cleared up, I can see that there is an ambiguity in my
original statement.  I said that, according to the axioms, every class
has a complement and hence (complement top) is null.  But "(complement
top) is null" is ambiguous between (= (complement top) null) and (null
(complement top)).  I think you took me (quite reasonably) to mean the
former, but what I meant was the latter, and that is indeed provable
from the axioms: (null (complement top)) means that (complement top) has
no instances, which is provable from the axiom that everything is an
instance of top and the axiom for complement.

&gt; &gt;The conclusion says only that (complement top) has the property of
&gt; &gt;being null, not that it is identical with the class nil.  Since
&gt; &gt;everything is an instance of top (axiom), nothing is an instance of
&gt; &gt;(complement top) (axiom for complement), i.e., it is null (axiom for
&gt; &gt;null).

The same ambiguity is present here.

&gt; ### Perhaps there are some hitherto undocumented properties of the
&gt; interpreter for KIF++ (I'm sure there are and that they need to
&gt; surface in fact), but I stand by my earlier comment that without
&gt; additional axioms and/or knowledge about the said interpreter it is
&gt; not possible to prove from
&gt;
&gt; (forall (?x) (instance-of ?x A)))
&gt;
&gt; that
&gt;
&gt; A equals top,
&gt;
&gt; or
&gt;
&gt; (= A top)
&gt;
&gt; depending on the imagined "semantics" of your interpreter.

I totally agree with this, and have said as much with regard to null in
the document: "Classes are not assumed to be extensional, that is, they
are not assumed to be identical if they have the same instances.  Hence,
we cannot define emptiness as identity with null (as there may be many
distinct empty classes)."  I hope the clarification above shows that I
have not denied this.

&gt; ### this said, let me tell you unequivocally and sincerely that I
&gt; think you did a great (and courageous) job in publishing this
&gt; cold-pressed extra-virgin ontology for all of us to peek &amp; poke at.
&gt; But since it's there I feel ok in poking at it, and even to be wrong
&gt; about that occasionally (but not this time though)

I am most grateful for your comments and criticisms.  They can only lead
to improvements.
