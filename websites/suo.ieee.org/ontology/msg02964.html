JA: &quot;attack the paradox&quot; -- I see no paradox to attack.

KJ: It seems then that you have said a great deal about what you don’t see.

JA: I am talking about many things that I see.
    There is a patch of text that some people
    describe as a &quot;paradox&quot;.  I guess that
    they mean a logical aporia, antinomy,
    or other sort of insolubilium by it.
    But I do not describe it that way,
    as it does not seem to deserve
    the title of &quot;paradox&quot; in so
    exalted a sense, being a not
    too original syntact that
    has but the property of
    deceiving the eyes into
    a mistaken reading.
    So I would call it
    an &quot;illusion&quot;, if
    it comes to that.

KJ: This I can understand and appreciate but I had the sense
    that you wished to use the massaged example as an exemplar
    to dismiss the Liar paradox generally.

I think it's something to think about, but I have not looked much further into it.
Charles Peirce gave a similar, but much more detailed analysis of the Liar Paradox,
so I may take the time to revisit that.

I used to be pretty fami-liar with all of the sundry variations on the theme,
for example, those given in Quine's 'Ways of Paradox', as paradox was an old
acquaintaince, an all too ambivalent acquaintance of mine in undergrad daze,
but I have not gotten back to the subject with any re-vengeance since I hit
on this particular way of eliminating this local appearance of singularity.
I have collected a couple of newer books but not had a chance to read them:

| Barwise, Jon &amp; Etchemendy, John,
|'The Liar:  An Essay on Truth and Circularity',
| Oxford University Press, New York, NY, 1987.

| Barwise, Jon &amp; Moss, Lawrence,
|'Vicious Circles:  On the Mathematics of Non-Wellfounded Phenomena',
| Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford, CA, 1996.

Of course, the lure of the bottomless Bottom and his metaphormazes
is a big part of what the whole mistique of GSB's LOF and of later
plumbings of these non-well wells, by Aczel et alia, is all about.

KJ: There is another example given by Professor Mark Sainsbury in the
    'Oxford Companion to Philosophy' on page 482 (drawn from Chapter 5
    of his own book 'Paradoxes').   Do you have the same analysis?

I think that I need to get another cup of coffee
before I even think about getting into this fray!

MS: | “Jill says ‘I am now not speaking truly’.
    | If Jill is not speaking truly when this
    | is what she says she is up to, she is
    | speaking truly.  If she is speaking truly,
    | then she must be doing what she says, that is,
    | not speaking truly.  So, it seems, what she
    | says is true if, and only if, it is not true.”

KJ: This isn’t just a tweak, BTW; related to differing senses of ‘negation’.

JA: I am a classic case, and know no other not.
    Not in this case, what's ZOL there is here.

I apologize, but I am not familiar with the abbreviation “ZOL” -- ?

Let me descant:

ZOL, FOL, SOL, TOL, TI, DO, RE, ZOL, ...

ZOL = Zeroth Order Logic, Propositional Calculus, Sentential Logic.
 
JA: &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot; -- I do not see these as relevant dimensions
    in the present, almost purely &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;semiotic&quot; concerns.

KJ: I do not deny that “purely “logical” and “semiotic” concerns
    may go beyond ‘space’ and ‘time’, I simply point out that
    formal human comprehension/expression of them seems
    restricted to them and in particular ways.

JA: It is true that creatures such as we -- well, I should not presume on you,
    but I am pretty sure about the lion's share of me, anyway -- live and talk
    in spacetime.  Is that what you mean?  But can we not abstract for a' that?

KJ: I believe that human formal abstraction imports and over-in-lays its
    psychology onto/into the subject of its analysis.  In particular I am
    interested in the viewpoint limitations of ‘normal’ human analysis.

Well, that is what we call a &quot;failure of sufficient abstraction&quot; (FOSA),
since the aim of abstraction is precisely to lift the scales of overlay.

JA: &quot;pivot of reason&quot; -- ???

KJ: That which you reason from.

JA: I reason from premisses.
    Is that what you mean?

KJ: Yes, in part.  These might be considered the premises upon/with which
    you even conceive-of/manipulate your premises.  

KJ: I don’t claim that ‘space’ and ‘time’ are the ultimate/only pivots of reason.
    I only suggest that there is sufficient variation within humans to determine
    that these are key.  

JA: It is limited.  It is not zero.

KJ: Depends on how you look at it.  ‘Zero’ -– what is that?

JA: Alternative Interpretant:  &quot;It is limited.  It is not to be neglected.&quot;

Agreed.

JA: As long as you take the statement &quot;S = Not S&quot; to be false,
    and just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic,
    you cannot imagine any substitution for S to make it true.

KJ: ‘any substitution for S’

JA: &quot;just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic&quot;

KJ: I think you mean a conception of classical logic
    wherein paradoxes cannot be spoken of.  Certainly
    not the classical logic you have been currently
    using to speak of/about paradoxes.

JA: No, I mean the 'Classic' classical logic.
    It has axioms that can be recast like so:

JA: 1.  ((A, A)),  Identity.
    2.  (A, (A)),  Excluded Middle.
    3.  (A  (A)),  Non-Contradiction.

JA: For the other hemisphere:

    |    A   A            A          A
    |    o---o            o          o
    |     \ /         A   |          |
    |      o          o---o        A o
    |      |           \ /           |
    |      @            @            @
    |
    |   ((A, A))     (A, (A))     (A  (A))
    |
    |   Figure 1.    Figure 2.    Figure 3.
    |
    | Classical Axioms.  The Usual Unsuspects

JA: Of course, out of respect for the classics,
    I employed a lot of the logical redundants.

KJ: Ok.

KJ: Consider ‘any substitution for S’.  

KJ: Now consider ‘Not ‘any substitution for S’’ with respect to the former.

You lost me here.  I am involved in considering a propositional expression,
under the usual abuse of abstraction called &quot;Statement 0&quot;, in short, &quot;S_0&quot;.

|        S_1
|         o
|    S_1  |
|     o---o
|      \ /
|       o
|       |                S_0
|       @            =    @
|
| ((S_1 , (S_1) ))   =   S_0

The point is that I, the un-confused one, is not required to do any
substitution at all.  I can see just by looking at its logical form
that S_0 is the negation of an axiom, a denial of an intitial grant,
and I need not proceed any further, since I lack the funds to do so.

I really got to get some coffee ...
Will get back to the rest later ...

KJ: What is the former really saying in relationship to the latter?
    Well, we realize it’s saying that the latter is an instantiation
    of the former and that we could substitute the former for the latter.
    So, we’ll substitute that in.

KJ: Now we still recognize that “S = Not S” is false.
    But we also recognize that we are not saying that.  
    We are simply saying “S = S” which is true.

KJ: Digression:  We know the fraction ½ is Not the fraction 3/6.
    We also recognize that 3/6 is an instantiation of ½ and we can
    substitute the former for the latter.  Now we recognize that we
    were really speaking of ½ and ½.

KJ: There is no restriction on the persuasive arguments you might employ
    to attempt to establish or elaborate on the underlying identity of
    an object of interest.  Again, I don’t have a problem with that
    per se but I recognize it because I think it illustrates ‘moves’
    (shifts, etc.) that our formal reason can and does make.

KJ: It has to do with the ‘borders’ whereon a paradox sits.  Does the border belong
    to its interior (set) or exterior (complement)?   Both answers are consistent.

JA: If there are genuine paradoxes, they may have borders, I guess.
    But the present case is a simple illusion, and a simple error,
    and no good can come of mystiquing it, no more than admitting
    the equation &quot;2 = 3&quot; to ordinary arithmetic.

KJ: No, I was thinking of the borders of ‘reason’.
    The paradox sits on the border of reason.
    –Abstract- and consider reason as a set
    with borders.

KJ: To me, the important thing is to recognize that human formal reasoning has limitations.

JA: It has its peculiar limitations.  But that does not make it non-existent.
    It would become useless if arguments from false premisses are encouraged.

KJ: If I didn’t believe it was useful I would have long ago been consumed
    in Pyrrhic flames (it was a close call).  It is more disturbing, I think,
    to confront the “false premisses” that appear to be generated and sustained
    by our human psychology.  Arguments of (appeals to) absurdity carry great weight.

JA: Yes, but illusions are like that, whether of sense or of intellect, all the same way.

KJ: I am interested in science and I fear our psychology imposes insidious limitations upon us.
    I want to  move past that because the limitations may prevent us from making objective progress:
    We cannot distinguish indeterminacy at the boundaries of our reasoning from indeterminacy in the
    objects we study.
