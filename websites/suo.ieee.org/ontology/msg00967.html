&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Can I suggest that we have a name change?
&gt; &gt;&gt;Can we talk about something such as bodies and events rather than
&gt; &gt;&gt;continuants and occurrents?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well, there is a problem with that. Both spatiotemporal 
&gt; &gt;extensionalists like Matthew West and myself, and 3-d Endurantists 
&gt; &gt;(thanks for that terrific word, Chris) like Nicola and Peter Simons, 
&gt; &gt;will agree that we need to be able to describe bodies and events. 
&gt; &gt;The issue is over HOW to describe them. We had this kind of 
&gt; &gt;terminological discussion at Heidelberg, and Peter defended the 
&gt; &gt;long-winded kind of terminology on the grounds precisely that it 
&gt; &gt;WASNT 'intuitive', and therefore one didnt slip into the eternal 
&gt; &gt;trap of two people using the same word to refer to two different 
&gt; &gt;things without even being aware of it. Ordinary words are just too 
&gt; &gt;comfortable when we are doing ontology: every one can agree on facts 
&gt; &gt;about bodies and events, but they arent necessarily agreeing about 
&gt; &gt;how to formalise those facts, which is our central business.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; just to complicate things out there:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) there aren't only bodies and events: think about places, time 
&gt; spans, abstract entities, qualities, ... continuant/occurrent gives a 
&gt; chance to classify all this stuff with one criterion (not the only 
&gt; one available of course);
&gt; 
&gt; 2) body/event (better object/event?) is a VERY intuitive distinction, 
&gt; but intuition is not magic and it is not simply a linguistic 
&gt; convention: it is a  naturalistic and cultural product, derived from 
&gt; perception and interaction habits that our species developed (none 
&gt; familiar with Gibson's 'affordances'?). No walker will pay attention 
&gt; to stumbling over an event like 'running', but he probably would to 
&gt; stumbling over a 'running rabbit' as well as an astonished 'static 
&gt; rabbit';
&gt; 
&gt; 3) language structure depends on such intuitions. Nominalisation does 
&gt; not destroy the underlying conceptualization. It is only a way of 
&gt; making language more flexible in order to meet the needs of complex 
&gt; abstract thinking. Indeed, more 'practice-oriented' languages like 
&gt; early Latin do not show frequent nominalizations. Most 3-d 
&gt; ontologists keep naming events with nominalizations ..
&gt; 
&gt; 4) maybe in areas of human culture that heavily commit on everyday 
&gt; language assumptions (including (e-)commerce, law, and even 
&gt; biomedicine), would a strong 4-d perdurantist ontology have hard 
&gt; times?

MW: So far I have found that the opposite is true, it helps to simplify
things. Chris P has also done work in (I think) financial trading systems
(pretty abstract, legal, and human specific) and found a 4D approach
helpful.

MW: However, I don't think I would want to argue for a 4D view INSTEAD OF a
continuant/occurrent view, or a Piercean view (which I take to be different
again - subject to correction by John). Rather I think we should develop
each and relate them to each other, rather than the current process of
trying to merge them into one.

MW: Pat said some time ago that it is probably not possible to merge them,
and most of the discussion since has been convincing me he is right. Equally
people clearly do use different metaphysical paradigms in developing various
ontologies, and I doubt if that is about to stop, what ever we do here, so
relating these different paradigms would be a general service (and we might
learn something).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(snip) Simpler in spades. It is of course *possible* to choose one 
&gt; &gt;way of looking at a thing like a flame or a wave, and simply declare 
&gt; &gt;that this is the 'proper' view, and thereby place it firmly into one 
&gt; &gt;of the rigid classifications of an endurantist philosophical 
&gt; &gt;classification. Ive had this debate with Nicola, and he has a sure 
&gt; &gt;hand at doing this. However, this gives rise to ghastly problems 
&gt; &gt;when one actually gets down to the nitty-gritty axiomatic details. 
&gt; &gt;In order to reason about something like a flame, one needs to 
&gt; &gt;sometimes think of it as enduring like an object, keeping its 
&gt; &gt;identity through time, and sometimes to think of it as a dynamic 
&gt; &gt;process. Often, as for example expressing something like 'a gas flow 
&gt; &gt;rate which produces a manifold pressure below the critical value 
&gt; &gt;will cause flame loss and require re-ignition within five seconds to 
&gt; &gt;avoid an automatic emergency call', quite simple pieces of physical 
&gt; &gt;knowledge require that these different 'views' are interleaved very 
&gt; &gt;rapidly, sometimes in the same axiom. (For another example, try 
&gt; &gt;formalizing the reasoning behind the conclusion that one should not 
&gt; &gt;drink from a cup which has been dipped into a sewer and then filled 
&gt; &gt;with clean water.) For an endurantist like Nicola, the only option 
&gt; &gt;is to introduce *two* things here: the flame-as-process and the 
&gt; &gt;flame-as-entity (like distinguishing a person from their life), and 
&gt; &gt;to say one type of things about one of them and the other about the 
&gt; &gt;other of them, and have elaborate axioms connecting them together in 
&gt; &gt;appropriate ways. For example, we might have to say explicitly that 
&gt; &gt;for any time during the lifetime, it is true at that time that the 
&gt; &gt;life is being (notice the use of the continuous tense, suitable only 
&gt; &gt;for processes) the life of the thing. And this is possible, but it 
&gt; &gt;is all UNNECESSARY. Why should we be forced into such torture, to 
&gt; &gt;satisfy Nicola's (or Peter's, or John Sowa's, or Niles's, or mine 
&gt; &gt;for that matter) philosophical/linguistic feelings about what needs 
&gt; &gt;to be distinguished from what?
&gt; 
&gt; Why unnecessary? after all, you should not have all concepts in all 
&gt; contexts and/or from all viewpoints. Anyway, in a not-so-naïve 
&gt; ontology of chemical processes from an everyday life viewpoint, a 
&gt; flame is an amount of glowing gas that is one of the products of a 
&gt; combustion process.
&gt; In your example, you might not interleave views within the same 
&gt; axiom, firstly because you can hardly describe that concept with one 
&gt; axiom only, secondly because re-ignition, flow-rate, and loss are all 
&gt; processes that concern amounts of gas. In a 4-d conceptualization of 
&gt; your example one could end up creating many parts of a 4-d flame, 
&gt; each accounting for the process at hand ..
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;BTW, to elaborate on another message I sent in reply to Niles, many 
&gt; &gt;of these categorizations derive from natural language usage. NL 
&gt; &gt;structures (case distinctions, the verb/noun distinction, and such 
&gt; &gt;things as temporal aspect) often do suggest exactly this kind of 
&gt; &gt;distinction, and have motivated much of the relevant philsophical 
&gt; &gt;work that underpins it (such as the absurd doctrine that all 
&gt; &gt;occurrents can only be individuated by a connecting continuant.) But 
&gt; &gt;it is vitally important to bear in mind that NL is NOT an ontology 
&gt; &gt;language. It evolved for human communication in real time, between 
&gt; &gt;creatures living in a 'present'. It is a fundamentally tensed, 
&gt; &gt;indexical language used for highly context-dependent  communication 
&gt; &gt;betwseen intelligent agents about an essentially 3-d world. Our 
&gt; &gt;ontologies, to be any use at all, need to stay true throughout time; 
&gt; &gt;they are not in a tensed or indexical langauge; they cannot rely on 
&gt; &gt;the intelligence or quick-wittedness of the reader,  and they are 
&gt; &gt;being used largely to support reasoning, not to communicate 
&gt; &gt;immediate facts about the local circumstances of a speech act. This 
&gt; &gt;is basically why linguistic intutions do more harm than good in 
&gt; &gt;practical ontology design.
&gt; &gt;In any case, I would add, more up-to-date empirical work on 
&gt; &gt;languages has often shown that the categorisations of earlier 
&gt; &gt;analyses are simplistic. English nominalisation, in particular, 
&gt; &gt;almost destroys the noun/verb distinction in practice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that natural language is biased towards "context-dependent 
&gt; communication between intelligent agents about an essentially 3-d 
&gt; world" (nice headline!), and it is just for this reason that I 
&gt; believe that an ontology that cannot easily map basic linguistic 
&gt; distinctions can be at odds in some domains.
&gt; But I am not saying that we should directly buy temporal aspects and 
&gt; noun/verb usage of a language: what counts is the conceptualization 
&gt; underlying linguistic structures. Actually, comparative linguists 
&gt; know that linguistic structures could be very different between 
&gt; different languages, even affecting the 'style of thinking' of native 
&gt; speakers. Nonetheless, such variety is neither unlimited nor 
&gt; accidental.
&gt; Still more beef: one of the applications where a top-level ontology 
&gt; seems really useful is the construction of cross-wordnets (e.g. 
&gt; Eurowordnet evolution).

MW: I think this reinforces what I was saying above.
