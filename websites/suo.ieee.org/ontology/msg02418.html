The enormous volume of messages to the SUO list has forced many
people to unsubscribe to SUO because they cannot afford the time
to wade through all the messages.  Various people have suggested
solutions such as setting up multiple mailing lists, but that hasn't
seemed to work.

Another solution is to switch to a newsletter or web-zine format,
which has proved to be successful for a large number of special
interest groups.  Recently, version 2.0 of the Slash code -- software
that is used to support the Slashdot web site and several smaller sites,
has been released under the Gnu GPL license.  Following is the web
site where the code and documentation are available:

   <A  HREF="http://slashcode.com/">http://slashcode.com/</A>

At the end of this note are some excerpts from the README page
for the Slash code.

Slash is designed to support a home page that contains multiple
headlines for each thread, followed by a paragraph that gives
an abstract or summary of the thread.  Then for each thread, there's
another page which contains the body of that story, article, or
whatever.  Following that are an open-ended number of comments to
which anyone is welcome to contribute.

For those people who have never seen the Slashdot web site, see

   <A  HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">http://www.slashdot.org/</A>

This is the default format, but the colors, icons, headings, etc.,
can be freely customized for any subject matter.

The Slashdot policy is to give a small number of people the option
of posting new "stories" to the main page, but anyone can freely add
new comments to the threads for any story.  For the SUO, that policy
could be adapted to allow any voting member to post a new story,
while anyone could add comments to the threads.

This approach has several advantages over an email message system:

 1. No mailbox clutter.  Nothing appears in the readers' mailbox
    at any time, no matter how many stories, threads, or comments
    are posted.

 2. Anyone in the world is free to look at the main page to see what
    stories have been posted and to add any comments to the follow-up
    web pages.

 3. Voting members can post new stories at any time, with abstracts
    on the main page and an arbitrarily long article on the follow-up
    page.  They are also welcome to comment and reply to their own
    articles or anybody else's articles.

 4. All comments are organized by thread, and anyone can navigate
    through them very easily and add comments by typing anything in
    a comment box at the end of the page.  (Pointers to other sites,
    diagrams, or other articles can be included in any comment.)

 5. There would be no need to repeat the full text of every previous
    comment in new comments, since all comments would be displayed
    on the same page.  It would be easy for any reader to move the
    browser up or down to look at previous comments or the main story
    that they refer to.

 6. Sidebars on the home page can have pointers to related information,
    such as glossaries, rules and regulations, pending issues to be
    voted on, whitepapers, draft standard proposals, or whatever else
    may be considered of interest to the voting members, prospective
    members, or visitors to the web site.

 7. Old stories, threads, and comments are automatically archived.
    The moderator can establish a policy for how long any story
    remains on the home page.  Slashdot leaves stories on the home
    page for 24 hours, but the SUO site might leave them on the
    home page for a week or more.  Popular, long-running stories,
    could be moved to the archive, but with a pointer from a sidebar
    on the home page.

The Slash code is written in Perl, and somebody with Perl experience
would have to volunteer to look at the code, install it on the IEEE
server, customize it for the SUO, and do whatever maintenance or
updates might be needed from time to time.

Following are some excerpts from the Slashcode web site.  I'm also
cc'ing this note to CG list.  Although the CG list doesn't have as
high a volume as the SUO list, some such software might be considered
for CG list as well.

_________________________________________________________________________

Slash -- Slashdot Like Automated Storytelling Homepage -- is the code
that runs Slashdot. More than that, however, Slash is an architecture
for putting together web sites. It comes with functionality for posting
articles, conducting polls, having discussions, and more. But it can be
extended in innumerable ways.

Slash is written in Perl, and is built on top of Apache and mod_perl.
It requires a database backend, though the only well-supported database
used with it is MySQL (more databases will become well-supported as
time goes on; PostgreSQL support is already well on its way). Slash is
fast, scalable, and secure (as evidenced by one of the best test cases
you could have, running Slashdot itself).

Through a plugin system, developers can add functionality to Slash.
Through themes and templates (which are written using Template Toolkit),
the look and feel of a Slash site can be customized.

See INSTALL for information about installing Slash, including hardware
and software requirements. Read that document carefully, and follow the
instructions as precisely as possible.

Slash is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.
