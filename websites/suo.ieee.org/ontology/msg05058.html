RATD.  Note 4

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

This is the most valiant effort that I have seen so far,
but the problem with this form of exposition is that it
tends to focus the learner's attention exclusively on a
single triple &lt;John, Book, Mary&gt; in the 3-adic relation
commonly indicated by the rheme &quot;___ gives ___ to ___&quot;.
And no matter how you syntacticize the description or
graphicize the depiction of that single triple, which
latter task CG's naturally do beautifully, that triple
is not the 3-adic relation &quot;Gives&quot;, but only a single
instance of it.

I am very much in favor of &quot;concrete and simple examples&quot; (CASE's).
But a CASE of something that is not a k-adic relation, but only a
CASE of a single k-tuple, will be of rather limited use in trying
to understand what a k-adic relation really is, namely, a subset
of a k-fold cartesian product, when taken in extension, which is
the most concrete and most simple way that it can be approached.

In effect, you have presented a case of a CASE of a 3-adic relation, and so
there is a long way to go before giving a CASE of a 3-adic relation itself.

Much of the confusion about the various kinds of reducibility among relations arises
from fixating exclusively on single k-tuples in those relations, instead of taking
the relation, a set of k-tuples, as a whole.  The k-tuple has properties that the
k-adic relation does not, and the k-adic relation has properties that the k-tuple
does not, as a moment's reflection is enough to make obvious.

In particular, any single k-tuple x = &lt;x_1, ..., x_k&gt; in the cartesian product
X = X_1 x ... x X_k is reconstructible from the functional results of its
k projections 1st : X -&gt; X_1, ..., kth : X -&gt; X_k, that is, from the data
1st(x), ..., kth(x).  Indeed, it is not so surprising that the k-tuple x
is reconstructible from its k projections, since the k-fold product in
category theory is constructed in just such a way as to make this so.

These projections correspond to what many people call the &quot;places&quot; or &quot;roles&quot;
in a k-place relation.  For example, suppose that x = &lt;John, Book, Mary&gt; is
a triple in the 3-adic relation G c X = X_1 x X_2 x X_3.  Then, we have the
3 projections Donor : X -&gt; X_1, Gift : X -&gt; X_2, Recipient : X -&gt; X_3, and
we have the data that Donor(x) = John, Gift(x) = Book, Recipient(x) = Mary.
The triple x = &lt;John, Book, Mary&gt; is nothing but the minimal sort of thing
that is determined by this data.

The projections of the form jth : X -&gt; X_j are the &quot;monadic projections&quot;.
One may also define projections that extract any m-tuple, for m = 1 to k,
from a k-tuple in a k-fold product.  These are the &quot;m-adic projections&quot;.

For example, if X = X_1 x X_2 x X_3, then we have the &quot;dyadic projections&quot;:

   p_12 : X -&gt; X_1 x X_2,

   p_13 : X -&gt; X_1 x X_3,

   p_23 : X -&gt; X_2 x X_3.

Here we have one of the most important divergences in properties between
a single k-tuple and a k-adic relation, namely, that a k-tuple is defined
to be determined by its 1-adic projection data, but a k-adic relation in
general is not determined by its m-adic projection data for any m &lt; k.

I said &quot;in general&quot;.  As it happens, some, by no means all, k-adic relations
are determined by their m-adic projection data for certain values of m &lt; k.
One may call these &quot;m-projectively degenerate k-adic relations&quot;.

Hence, nothing but confusion will arise from continuing to extrapolate
from the properties of k-tuples to the properties of k-adic relations.

Since these issues have constant relevance to enfolding CG and FOL representations
within the category-theoretic language of IFF, and since MacLane begins his text
with this very same and this very important example of the cartesian product,
I will append my current collection of links to excerpts from Cat.Work.Math.

&gt; 
&gt; Rich,
&gt; 
&gt; I have spent so many years mapping propositions from one
&gt; notation for logic to another that I automatically &quot;see&quot;
&gt; the graph structure when I look at a formula in predicate
&gt; calculus.  But after thinking about the problem, I came
&gt; to realize that many people believe that notations that
&gt; look different somehow represent things differently.
&gt; 
&gt; To make the issues clearer, I'll translate the two graphs
&gt; to predicate calculus.  The graph at the top of give.gif
&gt; maps to the following formula:
&gt; 
&gt;    (Ex)(Person(John) &amp; Book(x) &amp; Person(Mary) &amp; Gives(John,x,Mary)).
&gt; 
&gt; This uses a common convention of treating names as &quot;constants&quot;
&gt; and introducing &quot;variables&quot; for things that don't have names.
&gt; That convention is convenient for arithmetic, but it causes
&gt; all kinds of trouble with people, who usually have multiple
&gt; names -- e.g., 'John', 'John Kennedy', 'John F. Kennedy',
&gt; 'John Fitzgerald Kennedy', 'Jack', 'J. F. Kennedy', 'JFK'...
&gt; And that doesn't even begin to get into the issues of
&gt; ambiguities, aliases, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; So I prefer to assign a variable to every concept node,
&gt; and to introduce a dyadic predicate to link the variable
&gt; to the name.  This leaves open the question of whether
&gt; names are ambiguous or unique.  It doesn't answer the
&gt; question, but at least it makes it explicit:
&gt; 
&gt;    (Ex)(Ey)(Ez)(Person(x) &amp; HasName(x,'John') &amp; Book(y)
&gt;      &amp; Person(z) &amp; HasName(z,'Mary') &amp; Gives(x,y,z)}.
&gt; 
&gt; There we have a triadic relation of type Gives, which
&gt; has three connections labeled x, y, and z.  By an accident
&gt; of history, those labels are called &quot;variables&quot;, but they
&gt; don't actually vary.  That is one of the hardest things
&gt; to teach beginners:  variables in logic don't vary; they
&gt; are nothing more nor less than labels of connections.
&gt; 
&gt; By using the same conventions, we can translate the
&gt; bottom graph to predicate calculus:
&gt; 
&gt;    (Ex)(Ey)(Ez)(Ez)(Person(x) &amp; HasName(x,'John') &amp; Book(y)
&gt;      &amp; Person(z) &amp; HasName(z,'Mary') &amp; Give(w)
&gt;      &amp; Agnt(w,x) &amp; Thme(w,y) &amp; Rcpt(w,z)).
&gt; 
&gt; Now the triadic relation Gives(x,y,z) has been replaced
&gt; by a monadic relation Give, and three dyadic relations
&gt; Agnt, Thme, and Rcpt.  But if you look at the graph,
&gt; there is still a three-way connection.  Why?
&gt; 
&gt; The point is that the fundamental structure of the
&gt; proposition does not change when you translate it from
&gt; one notation to another.  In order to see the structure,
&gt; you have to trace through all the connections of all
&gt; the variables.  Following is a little table of connections:
&gt; 
&gt;    x:  (Ex), Person(x), HasName(x,'John'), Agnt(w,x)
&gt; 
&gt;    y:  (Ey), Book(y), Thme(w,y)
&gt; 
&gt;    z:  (Ez), Person(z), HasName(z,'Mary'), Rcpt(w,z)
&gt; 
&gt;    w:  (Ew), Give(w), Agnt(w,x), Thme(w,y), Rcpt(w,z)
&gt; 
&gt; This still doesn't look very clear, and the repetition
&gt; of predicates in different lines of the table is confusing.
&gt; So perhaps it would be better if we drew a graph that
&gt; would show the connections more clearly.  That is the
&gt; graph named givepc.gif.
&gt; 
&gt; To draw givepc.gif, I made only one copy of each variable,
&gt; and I attached all the things to that copy that appear
&gt; on its row of the table above.  The graph named givepc.gif
&gt; is simply the formula in predicate calculus as it would be
&gt; seen from the point of view of the variables.
&gt; 
&gt; The structure of the graph now looks very similar to the two
&gt; CGs in the diagram give.gif, but it looks as if w has 5
&gt; links attached to it.  However, two of those links are not
&gt; really connections to other &quot;things&quot;.  One of them links
&gt; w to the backwards E, which asserts that something labeled w
&gt; exists, and another one links w to its type Give.  Therefore,
&gt; this graph still has only a triadic connection of &quot;things&quot;
&gt; to &quot;things&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; When you translate from one notation to another, all kinds
&gt; of syntactic features confuse the issue, but the underlying
&gt; pattern of connections remains the same.  That is one reason
&gt; why Peirce and I and many other people believe that graphs
&gt; are a more explicit notation for showing the structure
&gt; of logic.
