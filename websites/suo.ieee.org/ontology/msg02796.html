Matt

I don't feel your remarks and questions as off-topic. To know if intention,
awareness, purpose versus random, instinct, physical process should be a
major ontological distinction is not IMO a minor question. And it is really
a good example of where the cultural context does weigh on the ontology, and
even if the global feedback (or absence of feedback) I got on this question
lately seems to indicate that most people on this forum consider such
questions as being out of scope, I'll stick to the viewpoint that they are
not.

If you have an animist-pantheist view of the world, the intentionality is as
present in the willow growth or constellations patterns than in the building
of a temple. If you have a positivist-reductionist view of the world, there
is no more intentionality in any of those than in any other, because the
notion of intentionality is considered as irrelevant altogether.
Between those two extremes is a middle path that most people today I think
implicitly agree to walk on, where the frontier between "random physical
process" and "intentional process" is a very fuzzy one, depending on one's
undecidable arguments about what one considers to be intentional.
Controverses on universe and life evolution, anthropic principle (weak or
strong), Gaia, Global Brain and others of the same kind show that even
physical processes in the early hot universe may be considered by some
people as "early intentions".
One interesting cutting approach is to be found in Thermodynamics (works of
Prigogine and others), a cutoff being possible between near-equilibrium
processes well described by statistical laws (first and second thermodynamic
principles: a crowd in panic maybe in this case if people are considered as
particles with random moves commanded by pression, temperature and volume),
and far-for-equilibrium complex processes like air transport regulation,
football games, bird migrations and forest growth. Such a cutoff is maybe
the less culturally biased possible among the presently available
distinctions, in the sense that it can be grounded on somehow measurable
characteristics, not on undecidable judgments.

But the name we will give those categories will be loaded anyway. Not
mentioning purpose anywhere in the classification of processes - sticking to
thermodynamics categories - would make this classification irrelevant
wherever the users will want to declare intentionality (because in their
view of the world, there is intentionality), and moreover would implicitly
declare that intentionality in itself is a somehow irrelevant concept. So
maybe we have to keep intentionality as a (possible) attribute of process,
but abstain to declare which classes of process - if any - have this
property, letting it open to every user.

This is IMO just one aspect of the problem of cultural context. We have many
undecidable propositions of that kind at the upper level. I would tend to
consider that undecidability is even a *characteristic* of the upper level.
Otherwise, the work we are on would have been achieved centuries ago.
Culture is built on what a community agrees on about the major undecidable.
So either we try to be the less culturally biased and build a deliberately
ambiguous and fuzzy ontology, leaving open and available every choice about
undecidable propositions, and letting every user choose whatever fits one's
community view of the world, either we build a "unique thought" efficient
fit-all consensual ontology, cutting of the undecidable in an axiomatic
(dogma
tic?) way.

My hunch is that the market would be happy with the latter, and the
civilization with the former ... but I digress :o)

&gt; I'm just curious about something.  If a flock of geese (in formation)
&gt; exhibits agency, what about:
&gt;
&gt; * a swarm of bees?
&gt; * a culture of slime mold cells (collecting to form a stalk)?
&gt; * a crowd in a panic?
&gt; * a gameboard of Conway's 'Life'?
&gt; * particles in a multi-body physics problem?
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering about collective behavior or structure that looks
&gt; "organized" but that might have "intentionality" ranging from high to
&gt; none.  To me, "Organization" as a label implies intentionally-created
&gt; structure, rather than naturally-emergent structure.
&gt;
&gt; That is, if you would call a flock of geese an Organization, but you
&gt; wouldn't call a willow tree an Organization (even though we can observe
&gt; very rich and useful structure in it), it seems the difference is our
&gt; assumption that the geese are actively choosing to be in formation.  If
&gt; so, where is the cutoff between awareness, instinct, reflex, and low-level
&gt; chemical/physical processes that tell us when we're looking at agents or
&gt; organizati
ons?  Somewhat off-topic, I know; I just found it a curious
&gt; problem.
