&gt;Martin,
&gt;
&gt;Pat and I usually agree on mathematical and logical issues
&gt;and the terminology used to talk about them.  However, we
&gt;have been engaged in an interminable war about how the
&gt;formalisms are related to the world.  At the moment, we
&gt;are in the middle of a truce, which we agreed upon in order
&gt;to get on with the task of defining the foundations of KIF
&gt;and CGs.
&gt;
&gt;At the risk of disturbing that truce,

John, I would only change one single word in what you have written:

&gt;I would like to make
&gt;a comment that illustrates exactly where our disagreement lies.
&gt;The philosophical difference between Pat and me is illustrated
&gt;by the following diagram:
&gt;
&gt;   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A>
&gt;
&gt;On the left is the world, which Pat and I agree exists.
&gt;On the right is a theory, about which Pat and I usually
&gt;agree.  In the middle is a model of some aspect of the world.
&gt;
&gt;The difference between us is that I maintain that it is much
&gt;more convenient to treat models as abstract constructions
&gt;that have a mapping to whatever aspects of the world that we
&gt;may be interested in studying, talking about, planning for, etc.
&gt;Pat, however, maintains that "a Tarski-style model" is or
&gt;should

No; COULD be.  I hope that isnt a provocation to war. My claim is 
that the theory is entirely agnostic as to the nature of the things 
in the sets.

&gt;be constructed out of actual entities in the world, not
&gt;just pointers to or surrogates of entities.
&gt;
&gt;The truce consists in our agreeing that both kinds of models
&gt;can be isomorphic to one another, and for purely mathematical
&gt;discussions, there is no distinguishable difference between
&gt;a model made up of "real-world entities" or a model made up
&gt;of "pointers" or "surrogates".  There is, however, a difference
&gt;in the kinds of natural language comments that one might make
&gt;about those models and the kinds of metalevel reasoning that
&gt;one might use in relating models to the world.
&gt;
&gt;Some comments on your comments:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;2. I ( and maybe others like Graham Horn) rightly or wrongly feel it ought
&gt;
&gt; &gt;to be possible to have a formal language and explanations which are easier
&gt;
&gt; &gt;to understand and to easier to interpret than much of what we see written
&gt; &gt;by mathematicians as referring to the real world.
&gt;
&gt;I definitely agree.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;....  Furthermore, within IT, the word Relation is
&gt; &gt;strongly associated with what I believe is a correct but relatively limited
&gt;
&gt; &gt;application of the mathematical concept propounded by Ted Codd, viz. the
&gt; &gt;use and manipulation of tables of constant surrogates (?grounded tuples).
&gt;
&gt;Pat's major complaint about that view is that it limits
&gt;the theory to finite tables.  I think that we can all agree
&gt;to use the IT view, provided that we generalize the word
&gt;to admit arbitrarily large (possibly uncountable) tables.
&gt;Then the word "table" becomes a convenient synonym for
&gt;"extension of a relation", and IT people can visualize them
&gt;as printable displays while mathematicians are free to consider
&gt;infinite tables in their formalism.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I will raise another potential hazard.  The way the word  Model is used in
&gt;
&gt; &gt;mathematics can appear to be the exact inverse of its natural language
&gt; &gt;meaning.  In natural language if I say A is a model of B, it is B that is
&gt; &gt;the real thing, the building, aircraft, or whatever.  I understand
&gt; &gt;mathematicians to refer to some reality as a model of the mathematical
&gt; &gt;theory.  I don't wish to spend time arguing this, but suggest noting the
&gt; &gt;risk.
&gt;
&gt;Carl Adam Petri (of Petri-net fame) made exactly that point
&gt;about 30 years ago, and he argued for something very close
&gt;to my mthworld.gif picture.  Since Carl, Pat, and I have all
&gt;been trained as mathematicians, it is misleading to say that
&gt;the disagreement is between mathematicians and IT people.
&gt;
&gt;Suggestion:  To bring an end to this endless e-mail debate,
&gt;I recommend the following compromise:
&gt;
&gt; 1. When talking about the semantic foundations of a formal
&gt;    language, such as KIF or CGs, we discuss the methods of
&gt;    evaluating the truth of a statement in terms of a model
&gt;    without worrying about what the bottom-level elements of
&gt;    the model may happen to be.
&gt;
&gt; 2. When talking about how predicates or relations in KIF
&gt;    are mapped to "real world" entities, we can discuss the
&gt;    problems of measurement and experimental error by talking
&gt;    about syntactic features of the language and about the
&gt;    methods of mapping them to the world without using the
&gt;    word "model".
&gt;
&gt; 3. Whenever it does become necessary to talk about models
&gt;    and the world in the same breath, we can use the terms
&gt;    "abstract model" for what I talk about when I use the
&gt;    word "model" and "concrete model" for what Pat means
&gt;    when he uses the word "model".

With the understanding that 'concrete models' includes 'abstract 
models' as a special case, this would be fine. Apart from that 
quibble, I entirely concur.

Pat
