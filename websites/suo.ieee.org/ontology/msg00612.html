Matthew, your answer below is rather longer than I expected.  To precis my
understanding of your POV.

0. A spatio-temporal object is something in the real world, and can be
represented by a constant.

1. A spatio-temporal extent is something in the real world, and is
different from a spatio-temporal object.

2. An activity is something in the real world.

3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent

4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the real world
unless you are qualified to study advanced topics)

5.  Activities can be modeled as relations.  The example is modelled as
multiple dyadic and triadic relations.

6. Attempting to model a activities as a single n-adic relation may be
adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
between systems, and by implication for the SUO.

How am I doing so far?

Yours, Martin

Dear Martin,

I note this is just us. If that is an accident feel free to post this
thread.

I try to be careful to match representation form to what they represent, so
I recognise a spatio-temporal object as something that first exists in the
real world, and second has a consistent representation in the information
world, so as a constant such as a, b, c, fred, etc. A spatio-temporal
analysis of activities in the real world reveals them to be spatio-temporal
extents. They consist of the temporal parts of the objects that are playing
a role in the activity. Thus I expect them to be represented as
spatio-temporal objects, i.e. by a constant, as above.

Actual relationships exist in the same way that actual classes do. They are
abstract objects that are out there that we can take an interest in and use
to organise and think about the world. Actual relationships are what one
thing has to do with another. I note that a relation like:
&lt;purchase, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;
does not represent a relationship, but actually a number of relationships
that each element of this construct has to an object that is not part of,
but may be inferred from this construct.

So in analysis I look for recognition of this. I would analyse the above
into:
&lt;Purchase a&gt;
&lt;Purchaseof a b&gt;
&lt;Datetimeof a 12:15-12th-August-1999&gt;
&lt;lawnmower b&gt;
&lt;HondaCB250 b&gt;
&lt;hasprice HondaCB250 c&gt;
&lt;GBPvaluemap c 500&gt;

Or something similar. So I have extracted and represented the actual
relationships.

Not that there is anything wrong with the original data structure in a
purchasing system, but you do have to extract what it means if you are to
make that available without everyone having to learn the language of every
other system.

Does this provide an answer?

Regards
      Matthew

&gt; Matthew, recently you very usefully challenged me about whether I was
&gt; talking about the real world or representation.
&gt;
&gt; Below you say inter alia "I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; spatio-temporal extent". and then "activities are frequently
&gt; modelled as
&gt; relations".  I think it would help many of us if could you
&gt; clarify your
&gt; view for each of activity, relation, and spatio-temporal
&gt; extent, which you
&gt; regard as being in the real world, and which are
&gt; representations used for
&gt; modelling?

&gt; Dear John,
&gt;
&gt; This doesn't help us much. In particular it doesn;t answer
&gt; the question we
&gt; started with, which is "Is an activity a relation?" where at
&gt; least Pat,
&gt; Chris P and I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; spatio-temporal extent, and
&gt; would feel uncompfortable that a relation was a
&gt; spatio-temporal extent. On
&gt; the hand many others note that activities are frequently modelled as
&gt; relations. Perhaps it is OK to do both, in which case is this
&gt; inconsistent?
&gt; Or does it just not matter?
&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew, Mike, et al.,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That is a very serious and very difficult question:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call what
&gt; &gt; it is in the real
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;world that they refer to?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box
&gt; &gt; of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
&gt; &gt; realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
&gt; &gt; use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
&gt; &gt; together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
&gt; &gt; other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
&gt; &gt; Java, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they
&gt; &gt; refer to in the real world?" all hell breaks loose.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
&gt; &gt; what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Suggestion:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
&gt; &gt;     interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
&gt; &gt;     satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
&gt; &gt;     is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
&gt; &gt;     purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
&gt; &gt;     realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
&gt; &gt;     words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
&gt; &gt;     let's not worry too much about what it is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
&gt; &gt;     the position that KIF is the official language to be used
&gt; &gt;     for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
&gt; &gt;     If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out"
&gt; &gt; that doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the
&gt; &gt; same cop out that Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his
&gt; &gt; Tractatus:  "Everything that can be said can be said clearly,
&gt; &gt; and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some
&gt; &gt; extra prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in
&gt; &gt; the SUO] can be said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot
&gt; &gt; speak [in KIF], thereof we must be silent.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is not an answer to the question of what do relations
&gt; &gt; really refer to.  It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the
&gt; &gt; only kind of cop out that will allow us to get some work done.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; John Sowa
&gt; &gt;
