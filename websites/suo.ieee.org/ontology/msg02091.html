&gt;Graham,
&gt;  I too am dismayed by the volume of discussion and the sense that 
&gt;although individual contributors have benefited from the discussion, 
&gt;and a rather small group is making progress on an ontology, that 
&gt;we're not working together and making collective progress on a 
&gt;standard.

Maybe you should learn from this observation, rather than regretting it.

&gt; I believe that the solution is not improved document management or 
&gt;better tools but rather for folks to be specific and concrete in 
&gt;developing a formal document expressing their preferred version of 
&gt;an upper ontology.

I think it is simply a reflection of a fact of life: people do not 
agree on ontological issues. They never have and they never will. 
Regretting this is like regretting that people speak different 
languages. My mum is sternly disapproving of the fact there there are 
people on the planet who don't naturally speak the Queen's English, 
an attitude that rather reminds me of yours towards the variety 
displayed on this very list.

Don't you think that a better attitude to this fact might be to find 
a way to utilize it, rather than try to 'solve' the 'problem'?

&gt;  If you believe something specific is lacking in the Merged 
&gt;ontology that Ian has been working on, suggest a new axiom, or set 
&gt;of terms.

Adam, speaking for myself, the major source of frustration is that 
people do not seem to read what one writes. Have you actually 
understood anything of what I wrote about what is wrong with the 
overall methodology of Niles' effort? It cannot be cured by adding 
more bits to it, any more than tossing a few more vegetables into a 
stew is going to turn it into a souffle.

&gt; If some folks would prefer EXIST or some other basis for the 
&gt;standard, then offer concrete extensions to it using the EBNF syntax 
&gt;defined for it.  Formalisms without explanation or discussion may 
&gt;make it difficult for some folks to communicate but discussion 
&gt;without formalisms will lead us simply to more talk.
&gt;  I would like to applaud those folks who have been very concrete 
&gt;(and forgive me for those who I have forgotten): Helena Sofia Pinto 
&gt;for contributing an ontology of units and measures, Nicola Guarino 
&gt;and his colleagues for their work on mereology, Pat Hayes for his 
&gt;detailed and specific help on temporal axioms, Chris Menzel, David 
&gt;Whitten and Robert Kent for their work on the "structural ontology". 
&gt;We should also thank John Sowa, Achille Varzi, Roberto Casati, James 
&gt;Allen, Barry Smith, Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig and all the 
&gt;unattributed contributors to the Ontolingua repository.
&gt;  If everyone on this list would create just some small ontology of 
&gt;even a dozen terms supported by axioms that has not yet been covered 
&gt;in the merged ontology, we could make tremendous progress.

No, we would simply have a larger and even more confused stew. The 
axiomatizations would be incompatiable with each other and would be 
based on sharply different views of the world. Surely this is vividly 
clear from the postings on this list? Matthew West's axioms would 
talk of 4-d entities and be based on a solid physical nominalism; Lee 
Auspitz' axioms would assume a tensed ontology and would take human 
experiences as their basic framework. Others would write axioms which 
transliterate one of several different kinds of English grammatical 
theory. We even seem to disagree on what words like 'set' and 'class' 
mean.

You have thanked me for my contribution on temporal axioms, but I 
wish you would not, since I regard the temporal axioms in Niles' 
document as a crock, and would refer that my name not be associated 
with them. There is no single generally useful axiomatization of 
time: that is why I wrote a temporal CATALOG, setting out the 
ALTERNATIVES and noting the ways they were INCOMPATIBLE with each 
other. I did that for a reason, not because I couldnt think of 
anything else.

&gt; This could also include domain-specific ontologies as the exercise 
&gt;of linking such ontologies to the merged ontology will elucidate the 
&gt;general areas that need to be developed.
&gt;  How about a practical semiotics of books, recordings and documents;

Would it take a book to be a semiotic text with a physical encoding, 
or a physical object (a continuant or a 4-d lifetime?) to which 
contentful relations can be applied, or a kind of 'sum' of a physical 
entity plus a nonphysical 'text', or a collection (what kind of 
collection?) of surfaces bearing information-encoding marks, or...? 
(Please don't say 'all of these') Some people think of books as 
things with a history, like old furniture.

&gt;how about some basic graph theory with application to roads or 
&gt;computer networks; how about an ontology of human obligations;  an 
&gt;ontology of speech acts;  an ontology of textures and coverings;  an 
&gt;ontology of materials;  an ontology transfers of possession.  The 
&gt;number and richness of available areas is astonishing.

"All human life is there", I think is the quote you want.

&gt; For academics and industrial researchers there are a wealth of 
&gt;possible papers to write on these topics.

This raises an interesting question, in fact: where CAN one publish 
papers on ontological content?

Pat
