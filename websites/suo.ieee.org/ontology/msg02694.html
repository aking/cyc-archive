Jean-Marc,

A bit of a preface, and then on to specifics.
I would like to say that I am trying to keep
within the intersection of multiple pragmata,
those to which the folks who sign on for one
particular interest or another have to share.
But, of course, I can't say that, not in the
narrowest construction of the terms, since I
have distinct notions of what these concerns
ultimately urge us to.  So I think of myself
as working prospectively, toward that future
intersection, on earth, let us pray, and not
in the sky, of our several currently diverse,
sundry, skew, truncated, or transverse lines.
As I long as stay that course then I feel in
my own heart and mind that I am in true form.

&gt; 
&gt; Jon, I don't know why you insist on translating the term "mind"
&gt; into "a person's mind" each time that it appears in a definition.

Our interest here is in "interpreters" of all kinds, interpretive agents,
conductors, and passengers, and even stowaways, on the trains of semiosis,
for which I, personally, but abstractly and formally, do not care what word
we deploy -- "quasi-mind" was one of Peirce's personal best -- so long as we
get the idea right, and that, in my current vein of extensional mining, leads
to the concourse of the sign relation itself.  And I have already cited all of
the most critical passages from Peirce along the way that lead to the same end.
And, no doubt, will again.

&gt; Peirce writes in another text (MS 787)  "What is mind except a
&gt; faculty for ideas?".  If 'mind' only means 'the mind of a person'
&gt; to you, then I understand your position, but you must be aware of
&gt; the fact that Peirce did not use the term in such a restricted way.
&gt; 
&gt; Simply go through the "76 definitions" assembled at:
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm</A>

I am sorry that you force me to say this, but not all of these
so-called "definitions" are equal in their service to the idea,
nor could I expect them to be, since many were directed to one
particular application, audience, or level of approximation --
this is a fact of communication in general, and has nothing to
do with Peirce, per se -- it just so happens to be the reality
that some definitions are more definitive than others.

&gt; and you will see that the term 'mind' or 'thought' or 'interpreting thought'
&gt; appears not only in "the-sop-to-cerberus" definition, but in nearly all of
&gt; them, which are the pragmatic definitions.  The only definitions that do
&gt; not have 'mind' in them are the formal ones that use the term 'correlate',
&gt; or 'C' or whatever-you-like-to-call-it.

Nobody here, leastwise moi, is denying the prevalence of mind or consciousness
in our experience, if that is what you are worried about.  After I quit caring,
a long time ago, about that useless battle, I got myself moving on to looky at
the form and the pattern and the shape and the flow of all of this beauty that
just keeps on showing up in experience, as "contents" of that "container" that
all the warly folk call "consciousness".  After one gets over the bare fact of
it, one, this one, wishes to get on with delving into the form of it.  And for
carrying out that work the formal models that Peirce's work affords us, in the
form of sign relations, are simply the best tools for the job.  Given his very
clear staking out of a non-psychological line of inquiry -- which I can abduce
from other evidence to interrupret as a n.o.n.psychological line -- it is easy
to see that all of his other references to mind in a logical framework have to
be taken as applications and illustrations, not constitutive of logic, per se.

&gt; I have no problem in understanding the difference between
&gt; a formal definition that is as general as possible and needs
&gt; not refer to anything existing in particular and its application
&gt; in practice, so I believe that the discussion on whether the definition
&gt; of a sign should be either purely abstract and formal or more specialized
&gt; by referring to a 'mind' in general is of no interest whatsoever, except
&gt; for theorists who can't make the link between theory and practice.

Logic and psychology are independent.  Orthogonal.  At right angles to each other.
There is no contest here.  We are not dividing up a pie.  The lines are imaginary.
I have been to county road commission meetings where one party argues that all of
the roads in the county should go north-northwest and another party counters that
all of the roads in the county should go east-northeast, so I know that many such
journeys of discourse are possible.  Me, I just quit attending those meetings.

&gt; "What is a sign?"  Try and answer that question using the pragmatic maxim.
&gt; What are all the imaginable effects of a sign?  Do they affect only abstract
&gt; correlates in a formula?

"Go teach your grandmother to suck eggs." --
That's old version of "Been there, done that".

Still doing that,

Jon Awbrey
