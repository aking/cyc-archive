     I would be very reluctant to actually begin discussion of the structure of
a domain ontology that might be based on SUO until a substantial part of the
content of the SUO was actually agreed upon.  In particular, the definitions
of concepts will be extremely sensitive to the definitions of predicates
(or semantic relations or slots, if one adopts a KIF-convertable frame
representation) adopted as part of the standard.  I believe we need at least
some agreement on definitions of a few hundred basic concepts, like object,
relation, space, time, causality, process, agent, and event, before
domain-specific definitions will seem possible.  We can,
of course, just use certain primitives like agent and hope that the
predicates asserted about such concepts can be retro-fitted to a precise
logical basis when one becomes available.  My fear is that such an order of
proceeding will cause even more disagreement than would be
the case proceeding top-down.
     I do agree with Jim that having some domain-specific material to discuss
could increase motivation to contribute.  But I fear that without an agreed-on
basis for definitions, there will be no obvious way to resolve disagreements
in a principled fashion.
    On the other hand, starting a search for some domain ontology to use
as a test case for application of the SUO does make a lot of sense at this
time.  Two possible areas that are of widespread interest would be an
enterprise ontology and a medical ontology.  I have no domain ontology
of my own to contribute.  If there are any exisiting domain ontologies
that are or could become part of the public domain, it
would be good to begin accumulation of a list of such.  When that
list is on hand, we could then revisit the question of whether we have
enough of the SUO itself to begin trying to define the basic concepts
of those ontologies in term of the SUO.

&gt; SUO,

&gt;         I would like to start a thread to explore the initiation of one or more
&gt; SUO-compliant domain ontologies.  It may be premature to actually start
&gt; some, but it's not too soon to start exploring the subject.
&gt;
&gt;         I see the following potential benefits to SUO:
&gt;
&gt;         1. It will provide SUO with practical requirements.  It will also help
&gt; us understand what perhaps is not important.  [It should be noted that
&gt; commercial applications will also provide the SUO WG with both
&gt; requirements and non-requirements.]
&gt;
&gt;         2. It may help speed up progress within SUO.
&gt;
&gt;         3. It could help us recruit additional active participants.
&gt;
&gt;         4. Some early trial domain ontologies will help us learn how to deal
&gt; with larger domain ontologies later on.  We need to develop a common
&gt; language (an ontology?) for talking about the topic of domain ontologies.
&gt;  We also need to learn how to deal with input from them.  We'll also need
&gt; learn how to deconflict content when it falls into multiple domains.  The
&gt; bottom line is that we have a lot to learn, so the sooner we get started
&gt; the better.
&gt;
&gt;         5. It could start the process of SUO adoption, which we'll eventually
&gt; need.
&gt;
&gt;         Now obviously, SUO would need to have some rough version of a base
&gt; document before a domain ontology could start building content based upon
&gt; it, but other forms of prep work could probably get started while SUO is
&gt; crystalizing.
&gt;
&gt;         I wonder if there are any members of SUO that already have a domain
&gt; ontology and would be willing to rework it based on KIF and SUO.
&gt;
&gt;         Another idea might be for the SUO standard to actually include a small
&gt; domain ontology as a demonstration of how SUO interrelates with it.  Of
&gt; course, this would require volunteers willing to do this work.
&gt;
&gt;         What are some other issues?
&gt;
&gt;         Is there anyone willing to put some work into this?
&gt;
&gt;         Does anyone know of any domain groups that might be willing to be the
&gt; first SUO-based ontology?
&gt;
&gt; Jim Schoening
&gt;
&gt; [I'm starting this thread on the main list because I see it as core to
&gt; the success of SUO.]
&gt; [If this thread develops momentum, we'll probably split it off as a
&gt; separate list.]
