Pat,

I would like to address the concluding paragraph of one of your
recent messages:

pat hayes wrote:

&gt; If you want to be able to talk about what might be true, then use a
&gt; modal logic explicitly, and keep that part of the ontology sharply
&gt; distinct from the parts that do not involve modal notions.
&gt; Incorporating modality into the structural ontology would make the
&gt; SUO worthless for all industrial and engineering applications.

I agree that for most practical applications, a modal theorem prover
is highly undesirable.  However, modality does enter into commercial
database systems at the metalevel (although that point is seldom
recognized by the people who routinely use those features).

That point, however, is a major topic of the research literature
about databases.  It is common practice to apply Kripke's semantics to
the problem of determining which DB updates are permissible according
to a given set of constraints (which are, in effect, first-order axioms).
They treat each state of the DB as a "possible world" and consider
the DB constraints as the criteria that determine whether one DB (world)
is accessible from another by a permissible update.

I enjoy pointing out to those people that what they are doing is
converting Kripke's semantics to Dunn's semantics by the method
that Dunn recommended in 1978:  treat the constraints as the laws
that determine the accessibility relation.  The usual reaction is
quite positive; they say "Yes! that's exactly what we've been doing,
where's the reference."

Below is an excerpt from my context paper:

   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/contexts.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/contexts.htm</A>

Summary:  The difference between a simple assertion and an axiom
or definition is its effect on DB (or KB) updates.  You can formalize
that point with a version of modal logic, or you can apply Dunn's
semantics.  The advantage of Dunn's semantics is that it lets you
use FOL at the metalevel to get the effect of modal logic at the
object level.  This approach is routinely used for "industrial and
engineering" applications.

Databases and Knowledge bases.  For computational purposes, Kripke's
possible worlds must be converted to symbolic representations that can
be stored and manipulated in a database or knowledge-based system.  The
mapping from Kripke's models to Dunn's models is essential for replacing
the physical world or some imaginary world with a computable symbolic
representation.  Following are the correspondences between Dunn's
semantics and the common terminology of databases and knowledge bases:

 * Laws.  An ontology in AI terminology or a conceptual schema in
   database terminology is a collection of axioms and definitions that
   determine the laws for any of Kripke's real or imaginary worlds. Those
   laws, which have also been called database constraints or business
   rules, must be true of every database that correctly represents
   something in the real world or a possible world.

   As an examples, a law or DB constraint might state that every person
   has two parents, one male and one female; and each person's age must
   be less than the age of either parent. Even if the facts stored in the
   database are incomplete, there must be room for adding the names and
   birthdates of the parents when they become known.

 * Facts.  The tables in a relational database correspond to ground level
   facts in a theory. All the laws (axioms and definitions or constraints
   and business rules) must be true of the database at all times.
   Therefore, anything deducible from the laws and the database must also
   be a fact. In Dunn's models, the set of all facts is the deductive
   closure of the laws and the ground-level facts.

   The ground-level facts, for example, might state the names and
   birthdates for everyone known to the system. The laws could be used
   to verify that nobody has more than two parents and to deduce family
   relationships such as siblings, grandparents, and cousins. During
   normal operations, the laws would not change, but the ground-level
   facts could be updated to record births, deaths, and marriages.

 * Accessibility relation.  Kripke's accessibility relation R(u,v) from
   a world u to a world v corresponds to a permissible update from
   a database that represents u to a database that represents v.  In
   database terms, accessibility corresponds to a update that observes
   the constraints: every law of u must remain true in the updated
   database that represents v.

   If some person already has two parents named in the database, no
   update that named a third parent for that person would be permitted.

After the possible worlds have been mapped to collections of laws
and facts in a database or knowledge base, the possible worlds become
unnecessary and ontologically dubious baggage.  All further theories
and computation can be stated in terms of the laws and facts.

The various axioms for modality correspond to different options for
permissible changes to a database or knowledge base.  In effect, they
specify policies for how a knowledge engineer or database administrator
could modify the laws to accommodate changes in the known scientific
principles or changes in the business or social structures.  Following
are the policies that correspond to the modal systems T, S4, and S5:

 * System T.  The basic modal logic, System T, would allow the DB
   administrator to promote any fact in the current database to the
   privileged status of a law or to demote any law to the status of a
   fact. However, no such change would modify the truth value of any
   law or fact, since both facts and laws are assumed to be true.

 * System S4.  The axiom S4, when added to System T, would allow the DB
   administrator to promote facts to laws, but not demote any laws to the
   status of mere facts. S4 would allow new laws to be made, but no laws
   could be repealed.

 * System S5.  The addition of axiom S5 to System S4 would require all
   accessible databases to have exactly the same laws. Therefore, the DB
   administrator would not be allowed make any changes to the collection
   of laws.

As an example, the constraint that every person must have two parents
of opposite sexes might be modified to accommodate sex-change operations.
The possibility of cloning might mean that some people might have only
one parent.  The axioms of System T would permit such modifications to
the laws, but System S4 would prohibit them because earlier laws could
not be deleted.  S5 would prohibit any changes to the laws.
