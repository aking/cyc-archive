Dear Lee,

I thought we had gotten beyond this. Indeed I thought we had got to the
point where it was demonstrated (by Pat, but by me previously) that in
representation terms anything can be reduced to dyadic relations.

This caused a change in tack to saying that there are axioms that require
more than 2 arguments (not a particular surprise to me). The question
remaining is then whether there are any axioms that cannot be reduced to
some set of independent axioms that involve only 3 elements.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; The "triadic" issue in the example you have given is whether we can
&gt; analyze this example into triads which add up to the whole 
&gt; picture without
&gt; any loss of logical content.  In listing the attributes of 
&gt; the measurement
&gt; problem you have already done this, if we can show that each 
&gt; element of
&gt; the problem-- time of observation, measurement device, 
&gt; measurement scale,
&gt; place of observation, observing subject, observed object etc.-- is
&gt; reducible to the pattern O(for object)-R(for representamen)-I (for
&gt; interpretant), where any R can also be seen as an O for some further
&gt; O-R-I, and any I can be seen as an O or R for some further 
&gt; O-R-I, and any
&gt; O may also be an R or an I, and so on, this whole business being the
&gt; continuum of semiosis, infinitely extendable and infinitesimally
&gt; refinable.

&gt; &gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This has been a very interesting discussion, in which I 
&gt; have learnt some
&gt; &gt; things, and been surprised at some things that I thought 
&gt; were common ground
&gt; &gt; but were not.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Firstly the good news. I think I now understand what John 
&gt; means when he says
&gt; &gt; "mediating". He means an activity, or the result of an 
&gt; activity, in which
&gt; &gt; more than two things are necessarily involved form an 
&gt; ontological viewpoint.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Pat has explained some theoretical background to graph 
&gt; theory from which I
&gt; &gt; draw (actually I already knew this) that there is more than 
&gt; one way that the
&gt; &gt; world can be represented as a graph (or some other 
&gt; formalism) and that the
&gt; &gt; triadic iirreducibility only applies when you take one particular
&gt; &gt; representation.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have one unanswered question. Part of the claim about irreducible
&gt; &gt; triadicity is that anything that is higher than triadic can 
&gt; be reduced to
&gt; &gt; triadic. Pat and Nicola (I think) have suggested that there 
&gt; is no reason why
&gt; &gt; the limit should be 3 for ontological dependence. So I have 
&gt; presented a test
&gt; &gt; example about measurement. Measurement is just about the 
&gt; most complicated
&gt; &gt; thing I have come across in my years of analysis, and I am 
&gt; prepared to
&gt; &gt; believe that if the information about a measurement can be 
&gt; reduced to triads
&gt; &gt; that are independent, then it is likely that anything else 
&gt; can. On the other
&gt; &gt; hand John has not responded to this example, which I repeat below.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: OK. In that case please show me how a measurement can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; reduced to triads. A Measurement is an activity that:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; has a subject (the thing measured)
&gt; &gt; &gt; an observer (doing the measuring)
&gt; &gt; &gt; an instrument (e.g. thermometer)
&gt; &gt; &gt; a measure (what about the thing is being measured, e.g. 
&gt; temperature)
&gt; &gt; &gt; a result (the value e.g. 20)
&gt; &gt; &gt; a Unit of Measure (e.g. Celsius)
&gt; &gt; &gt; the time when the measurement was taken.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would be interested to see whether and how this can be 
&gt; reduced to triadic
&gt; &gt; or less ontologically dependent elements. If it can't, then 
&gt; there is at
&gt; &gt; least one case where this does not apply (which is enough) 
&gt; or perhaps as Pat
&gt; &gt; has been suggesting there has been confusion between graph 
&gt; theory and
&gt; &gt; ontology.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well I guess the next question is "does it really matter?". 
&gt; By this I mean,
&gt; &gt; does it really matter that there are different mappings 
&gt; from the world onto
&gt; &gt; graph theoretic representations.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately the answer is "yes", as we discovered in 
&gt; Shell some 10-15
&gt; &gt; years ago. At about that time many of the 200 or so 
&gt; companies in the Shell
&gt; &gt; Group were getting into relational databases, mostly 
&gt; developing much the
&gt; &gt; same systems to do much the same thing in different 
&gt; countries. Something
&gt; &gt; that we noticed to our horror was that all these systems 
&gt; were generally
&gt; &gt; incompatible, and that generally they were not 
&gt; transferrable either. We
&gt; &gt; (then the corporate data management group) were asked to 
&gt; look at why this
&gt; &gt; was the case.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The databases were generally documented in data models. 
&gt; (Data Models can be
&gt; &gt; seen as graphs with entity types as nodes, relationship 
&gt; types as edges, and
&gt; &gt; attribute types as leaf nodes.) When we examined the data 
&gt; models we found
&gt; &gt; that one of the (many) problems was that people had mapped 
&gt; the real world
&gt; &gt; onto these constructs in a variety of ways. Let us take 
&gt; activities as an
&gt; &gt; example:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) as a relationship type, with the participants at either 
&gt; end of the
&gt; &gt; relationship.
&gt; &gt; 2) as a "transaction" - an entity type with a number of dependent
&gt; &gt; relationships.
&gt; &gt; 3) as an independent entity type with non-dependent 
&gt; relationships to the
&gt; &gt; objects involved.
&gt; &gt; 4) a mixture of 2 &amp; 3.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  o------------o               o----------o
&gt; &gt;  |            |      throws   |          |
&gt; &gt;  |  person    |&gt;-------------&lt;|   ball   |
&gt; &gt;  |            |               |          |
&gt; &gt;  o------------o               o----------o
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  o------------o               o----------o
&gt; &gt;  |            |    thrower    |          |

&gt; &gt;  |  throws    |               |          |

&gt; &gt;  |            |               |          |
&gt; &gt;  o------------o               o----------o
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and even 3)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  o------------o               o----------o          o----------o
&gt; &gt;  |            |               |          |          |          |

&gt; &gt;  |  throws    |               |          |          |          |
&gt; &gt;  |            |               o----------o          o----------o

&gt; &gt;  |            |               |          |          |          |
&gt; &gt;  |            |--------------&lt;|  thrown  |&gt;---------|  ball    |
&gt; &gt;  |            |               |          |          |          |
&gt; &gt;  o------------o               o----------o          o----------o
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course these different structures are not directly compatible
&gt; &gt; and in many cases arbitrary combinations of these different 
&gt; approaches
&gt; &gt; were taken.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So one of the things we did was to study the differences 
&gt; between these
&gt; &gt; (and other) representations. The conclusions to these have been
&gt; &gt; implemented in the EPISTLE Core Model. Incidently, the ECM V4.0
&gt; &gt; has just been published, and can be found at:
