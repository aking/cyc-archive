SUO Members,

	The following is a response to the objections posted by Lee Auspitz
and Bob Spillers (copies below).
	
	To state the bottom line up front:  As there were only two
objections to the adoption of the 'Proposed Conclusions' (copy below), and
as the alternative is to start over with a new vote (which I hear no
consensus for), it appears the best approach is to allow the adoption of the
'Proposed Conclusions' to stand.  This is not locked in concrete.  If
consensus emerges for conducting a new vote, or some other alternative, we
can explore this further.  

	The following is rationale for the above and responses to Lee and
Bob's points:

1. Should a vote to taken at all?  Bob stated "this vote is unnecessary."
Response: The SUO WG is chartered to develop a standards document, which can
only be accomplished by starting with one or more documents and improving
and building consensus around them. I assert that anyone with any document
that is remotely close to being a starting point for this WG deserves to
propose it and have it voted on.  There are several other SUO members that
have candidate documents, and I have told them this.  Also, the way to gain
maximum input to a document is to have the group working on it.  The way to
build consensus is to have the maximum number of people working and
reviewing a document, and doing so in a fair and open process.  This is the
purpose of a standards working group, not just to vote on a document at the
end of the development process.  In conclusion, if Ian Niles has a right to
submit the Merged Ontology for a vote (as a proposed starting point), and if
the prior vote is deemed insufficient, I conclude that another vote would be
in order (which could be an official vote since we will have established
voting rights by 2 March).  However, I hear no interest in reconducting this
vote.

2. It is a completely separate issue as to whether a given document passes a
vote.  Any voting member can vote against a document for any reason, but
that should not be confused with whether a vote is appropriate or not.

3. Regarding the process on this vote:  Since we had not yet established
voting rights, it was not possible to conduct an official vote, but it was
possible to conduct a straw poll and then see if there was consensus to
proceed based on it.  Since this was not an official vote, I did not post
the results as being official.   Rather, I posted 'Proposed Conclusions'
(copy below).  After a number of days went by with no objections (Bob did
ask a question, but did not object), I considered it appropriate to post a
message adopting the 'Proposed Conclusions' and proceeding with the first
step of calling for volunteers for Technical Editor.  After that is when Lee
and Bob sent in the below objections.  I agree this process was not perfect
and did not produce 100% consensus, but with only two objections, I assert
we do have more than enough consensus to proceed with the results of the
straw poll and the Proposed Conclusions.  If this is not so, others should
speak up and we can explore alternatives. 

4. Lee asked for the vote comments to be summarized, and also questioned
whether adequate consensus had been achieved on them.  Response:  All
relevant comments were posted, were discussed, are documented on the
archives pages, and a number of people changed their votes based on these
discussions.  I agree it would be nice to summarize and document these
points, but I think we can proceed in parallel to this being done.  Are
there any volunteers willing to do this?  Lee?  If not, I will do so.  

5. Resolving Comments: Resolving a comment does not require reaching
consensus, only that an attempt is made.  In reality, if too many comments
do not have consensus the document may not get a majority vote within the
working group, or worse yet, may not get 75% approval in final balloting, so
it is always good to try very hard to maximize consensus, but it is not a
requirement.  

6. Lee objected to multiple votes from individuals from the same company.
Response: Voting in IEEE working groups is by individual, with no
restrictions to number of individuals from a given company. The exception is
that our PAR could have established voting by 'entity,' but we did not
selection that option.  I know of no way our WG can deny voting to any
individual, but Lee is free to explore this with IEEE.   SUO now has 43
people with voting rights, so I doubt this will be much of an issue in the
future.  Also, the only vote that counts in the end is the final ballot,
which is open to all IEEE members and requires 75% approval and must be a
balance group.  Also, if you try to prevent members from the same company,
what about members with business relationships, family relationships,
drinking relationships, and you can quickly see things would get out of
hand.  

7. Definition of Majority Vote:  Bob questioned whether Robert's Rules of
Order (RRO) indicates whether an ABSTAIN should be counted in a majority
vote. He quotes RRO that blank votes are not counted, and questions whether
an ABSTAIN is a blank vote, since it can have comments.  All my experience,
and that of the people I have asked, is that ABSTAINS are not counted.  Bob,
if you believe otherwise, I ask you to research this issue and bring it back
to the group.

8. Bob refers to a 75% majority.  It sounds like he is thinking of the final
sponsor ballot within IEEE, which does require something like: Of those in
the balloting group, at least 75% must cast a vote, and of those votes, at
least 75% must vote YES.  This is a specific rule for IEEE final ballots and
does not apply within an IEEE working group, where the default is
'majority.'

I'm sure we could go forever debating these details, but the big picture is
that it appears we have adequate consensus to proceed as proposed, i.e. to
select a Technical Editor for the Merged Ontology and bring that document
under the control of this working group.

Bob Spillers wrote on 2/20: 

Jim, 
I share Lee's concerns regarding these issues. 
However I wish to discuss issues about the vote itself and what, if
anything, it means.   It is not clear from Robert's Rules of Order  that the
vote should be counted by the method you used - particularly how the ABSTAIN
votes were counted.  It is a possible interpretation - Robert's calls for
counting of all the votes cast and determining a majority of the YES vs NO
votes with blank votes not counted.   In this circumstance is an ABSTAIN
vote a blank vote?   Since it requires comments, I think it is not a blank
vote.  Reasonable people can disagree, but it is not clear how the rule
should be applied. 
It is unwise to wait until the vote is taken to announce the method and
authority used to determine the results. 
Robert's rules were not designed for this sort of vote and the
interpretation of this particular issue is murky.  Clearly most standards
efforts strive for a broad based consensus and usually require 75% of those
eligible to vote (effectively a quorum) and 75% of those actually voting.
ABSTAIN whether counted as NO or not does apply to the calculation of 75% of
those actually voting.  (In your call for a vote ABSTAIN was listed as a
possible voting choice with attendant requirements - i.e. comments
required.) 
Regardless of how the vote was counted, other provisions of Robert's Rules
were not observed.  In particular the making of motions and call for a vote
on the  initiative of the chair.  I do recall someone raising a point of
order. 
This vote was then characterized as a "straw vote" and not an "official"
action of the group.  I have no problem with an expression of opinion.  I do
have a problem if the chair then announces his "Proposed Conclusions and
Actions" as a result of the "straw vote".  It appears to be an official
action of the WG. 
Reference to "a" or "one" unofficial document being worked on by some
members of the WG,  more accurately reflects the situation.   It is Niles
(Teknowledge?) work and he is completely in charge of how it proceeds.  If
he agrees to be bound by the consensus of the WG and do the work of
technical editor, I applaud him - it is very useful work.  An "official"
appointment as "technical editor"  is unnecessary and inappropriate.  It
appears to put a stamp on something that has not been formally agreed to.  I
have no objection to informal arrangements. 
Once again I wish to point out that I believe this vote to be unnecessary
and divisive. 
In your note of 2/13/01 titled " SUO: Proposed Conclusions and Actions from
Vote" you asked if there were any objections.  I object. 
Bob 

Lee Auspitz wrote on 2/20: 

Jim,

Maybe you or some ome of the other experts in IEEE procedure in our ranks
could clarify what is going on here. 
First you posted several topics as needing consensus before we proceed. What
is the status of the consensus on these topics?  Does it warrant plunging
ahead before developing a greater consensus?  I strongly think not.
Second, you responded to Graham Horn that it was wrong for a single
organization, no matter how large and influential, to claim multiple votes.
Yet of the 11 Yes votes I count at least three from Teknowledge just the
number needed to assure a majority.  Wasn't there some celebrated case in
IEEE involving bloc voting by a single company (as opposed to individualized
participation in the case of the Boeing participants)?  [This is the kind of
problem I tried to suggest in noting the limitations of the "material
interest" criterion for the peculiar character of the SUO.]
Of course this is only a straw vote, and everybody good humoredly followed
your request for it, your revision of it, your launching of discussion of
the comments, and now your declaration that we can put it all behind us on
the basis of Roberts Rules of Order. Before following this next turn I think
it would be prudent to ask you to summarize the status of consensus on the
discussion points you proposed and to assure that the agreement on them is
sufficient to make it productive to plunge onward. Otherwise, the next round
of reviews will not be more favorable than this round, or you may find
active participation limited to the point of diminishing legitimacy. The
array of talents on this list is very impressive for the job at hand, and
good advice has been proffered by seasoned hands.  It would be a pity to see
all this squandered.

Technical Editor 


SUO:
As there have been no objections to the below proposed conclusions and
proposed actions, they are considered adopted.  Congratulations, Ian, Adam,
and all those who have contributed to the Merged Ontology.
We now need to select a Technical Editor for this document, via an open and
fair process.    I would now like to issue a 'Call for Volunteers' for the
position of Technical Editor of the Merged Ontology document.  Please
respond to me and/or this list by Feb 23rd, or if this is not enough time,
ask for an extension.

Subject:	SUO: Proposed Conclusions and Actions from Vote 


SUO,

Final vote results on Merged Ontology (see ballot question below) are: 
YES = 11
NO  = 9
ABSTAIN = 4 

YES votes were from: John Thompson, Adam Pease, John Velman, Graham Horn,
Roberto Bordogna, Ian Niles, Douglas McDavid, John Sowa, Fredrick Chase,
Frank Farance, Jay Halcomb.
NO votes were from: Matthew West, Chris Partridge, Robert Kent, Stefano
Borgo, John Dickert, Francis McCabe, Lee Auspitz, Bob Spillers, Chris Angus.
ABSTAINs were from: Pat Hayes, Michael Uschold, Sofia Pinto, Nicola Guarino
Please correct me if I have tabulated your vote incorrectly.
Observations: 
1.	The IEEE default voting rule within a working group is a simple
majority of YES vs. NO votes, with ABSTAINs not included in determining
majority.  
2.	This vote was presented as an unofficial straw poll, because we are
currently establishing the list of official voters.
3.	We previously established considerable opposition to calling the
Merged Ontology a "Base Document," and have since modified the question to
remove this label.  
4.	All comments that were directly related to the question have been
posted, and received much discussion.  Some votes did change as a result of
discussion and are reflected in the above results.  Those comments that
related to improving the document were not to be addressed until and unless
the group decided to work on this document.  This is the way ballot
resolution works.  We try to improve documents and build consensus by
resolving comments.
5.	This is a very early-on vote in the development of the proposed
document.
It will eventually need to gain 75% approval from the final balloting group.
Proposed Conclusions:
1.	A simple majority voted YES to the question (copy below), therefore,
this vote has passed, but by a recognized thin margin. 
2.	Aside from the thin approval margin, the group appears to have
rather strong consensus that work should proceed on the Merged Ontology.
This comes even from many of those who voted NO, who did so for the reasons
in the posted comments. 

Proposed Actions resulting from above:
Step 1: Post link to Merged Ontology on SUO web site at <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org">http://suo.ieee.org</A>.
as follows: 
Documents under development by this working group:
1.	Merged Ontology &lt;link address&gt;

Step 2: Select a Technical Editor for Merged Ontology document, to be
accomplished by issuing a 'Call for volunteers' followed by an open and fair
selection process.
Step 3: Place Merged Ontology Document under control of SUO WG, requiring
Technical Editor to gain approval from group before making changes.  This
would be mostly via an informal consensus process, but would also include
formal votes (with comment resolution) every 3-6 months.  Step 4: Technical
Editor will resolve all comments from the previous vote that dealt with
improvements to Merged Ontology.  Additional comments will also be
solicited.
Are there any objections to these Observations, Proposed Conclusions, or
Proposed Actions?

Subject:	SUO: Revised Call for Vote on Merged Ontology



SUO Participants,
1.	Since the prior vote had a variety of problems, it is amended as
follows to focus on the key question.  
2.	If you have already cast a vote (and received acknowledgement) you
don't need to vote again, unless you wish to change your vote or comments.
However, this is an open list and all are welcome to post or repost their
opinions.
3.	This message is a call for a vote on the question:

Should the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology Working Group commence work on the
Merged Ontology as posted by Ian Niles with the intent of attempting to
develop it into a final standards document?
4.	Background:  If this vote passes, this document will change from
being the work (and under the control) of a group of individuals to being
the work (and under the control) of the SUO WG.  A Technical Editor will
need to be appointed or elected, who will need group approval before making
changes.  This does not require frequent formal votes for every change. A
better approach for daily or weekly updates is to develop consensus by
resolving objections, as we did when revising the Scope and Purpose.  In
other words, the editor posts a suggested change and asks for any
objections. Items that do not have clear consensus would be accumulated.
Then, every 3-6 months the group could have a formal vote on what would be
the next 'Working Draft.' Comments would be submitted and resolved before
approval as the next Working Draft.
5.	The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of consensus we
have for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need to decide
if we are going to go down this path or not.  A working group may decide to
work on more than one document, so anyone else is free to submit one.
6.	The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose improvements to
the document, unless they are major enough for you to vote against focusing
work on this document.  However, such general improvement comments are
welcome and will be resolved (but not unless and until the vote passes.
There would be no sense in resolving comments if the group does not want to
proceed with this document.).
7.	Since we are still in the process of establishing official voting
rights, I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw poll, such
that anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if consensus is
not clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote (once voting
rights are established).
8.	Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), NO (comments
required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
9.	You may send your votes either to me or to this reflector.
10.	Please vote by Feb 1, 2001.

Chair, SUO WG
