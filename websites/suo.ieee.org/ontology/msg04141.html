<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;...</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;*The* most significant problem with this paradigm, however, is the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;development and application of mappings.&nbsp; What is &quot;mapping&quot;, really?&nbsp; Can</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it be understood and taught to the general ontology-using public?&nbsp; Your</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;effort was successful because you were dealing with a closed system of a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;known and well-defined scope and data meanings.&nbsp; How can the mapping</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lessons you learned (and were learned in the above efforts) be applied to</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;an open system with a huge, unknown, and constantly evolving scope and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fuzzy, ambiguous, context-sensitive data meanings?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; The mapping problem is significant, to be sure, but is a problem in any</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of integration effort, whether using ontologies, or a more</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; conventional data warehouse approach.&nbsp; I would suggest that at least the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem is more manageable than typical systems integration approaches</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; where n components require n^2 mappings.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;While I agree that mapping is an issue regardless of the integration </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;paradigm/approach used (e.g., neutral model, data warehouse, database </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;federations), I don't agree that the neutral model offers any advantages </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;in terms of manageability.&nbsp; In fact, I think the problem is actually far </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;more complex and less manageable than n^2 direct mappings.&nbsp; Sure, you </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;reduce the number of mappings to 2 * n, but then you have to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; deal with:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; - loss of semantic precision when &quot;generalizing&quot; local data into the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; neutral model, making extraction (interpretation) of meaning in the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; neutral model by other connected data source imprecise or wrong.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; That could be a problem if the neutral model is not specific or detailed </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; enough.&nbsp; That needn't be the case however.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I feel I should respond to this indirectly, because - on reading your other responses - I feel that the following observation is the source of many of our differences of opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I think that our differences stem from differing assumptions about how an upper ontology is to be or will be used (a neutral integration model being one such use.)&nbsp; Your statement here implies that it is *possible* to be detailed and specific enough that the upper ontology/neutral model either cannot or will not be misused.&nbsp; (Matthew, in his response, makes the same assumption.)&nbsp; I feel this assumption is -- forgive me for saying and I intend no offense -- both naive and dogmatic.&nbsp; If &quot;people&quot; use the upper ontology/neutral model at all, they WILL misuse it and interpret it to their own needs - knowingly or unknowingly.&nbsp; All of my data modelling experience leads me to this position.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I envision a bunch of different communities of people creating a bunch of ontologies and mapping them together following some standardized protocols such that a &quot;knowledge web&quot; can be built up incrementally as people do their jobs locally (like the internet has grown based on a few standard protocols).&nbsp; I suspect that your vision is not dissimilar, though I cannot imagine what safeguards or procedures could possibly be put in place to prevent misuse of an upper ontology without some single overseeing arbiter to police its use.&nbsp; (I also don't know if this &quot;knowledge web&quot; is the same thing as the &quot;Semantic Web&quot;, though it's as valid an interpretation or vision as any.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps another important differing assumption is that you/Matthew assumption computing or modelling professionals will be interpreting the upper ontology/neutral model and, therefore, have the responsibility of using it correctly.&nbsp; I can't argue with this.&nbsp; My assumption, however, is that Joe Everyman can pick it up, use it, or create his own ontology if he wants to get what he knows into a computer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>We want the cost-of-entry for using an upper ontology to be low, right?&nbsp; We can't, therefore, assume or depend on people using it correctly; rather, we should build in the safe-fail features to make sure that when it fails, such a fail isn't disastrous and recovery operations can be immediately started.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mapping &quot;data source A&quot; -&gt; &quot;neutral model NM&quot; and &quot;data source B&quot; -&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &quot;neutral model NM&quot; is not the same mapping &quot;data source A + B&quot; -&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &quot;neutral model NM&quot;.&nbsp; If there's an overlap of information in A and B, </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; there's a kind of &quot;information multiplexing&quot; involved that makes correct </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; mapping more difficult.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I'm not sure I understand.&nbsp; Could you provide an example?</FONT>
</P>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Suppose I map data from a local driver's registration database (data source A) into state government database for motor-voter registration (data source NM).&nbsp; Suppose then that data from the Department of Motor Vehicles (data source B) is also mapped into the state database.&nbsp; If William Burkett in Los Angeles is translated from A into NM, there will be a motor-voter record for that individual created.&nbsp; If William C. Burkett from Los Angeles County is mapped from data source C into NM, then is a new motor-voter individual record created?&nbsp; If I'd had prior knowledge of the two data sources - A and B - I could write mapping rules that take into account the fact that data source A doesn't use middle initials and that if (1) first name-last name and (2) city is in county, the it's one and the same individual.&nbsp; If A and B are both mapped independantly of the knowledge of the other, it's very likely that there will be two records for the same individual in the NM.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mapping between A and B is straight-forward because the &quot;system&quot; is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; essentially closed: you know what is in A and what is in B.&nbsp; Mapping A to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; a NM is less deterministic: you *think* you know what is in NM, but if </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; others are free to map to it, their interpretation of what is in the NM </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; will likely be very different from yours.&nbsp; In other words, the assumption </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; that all mappers will interpret the NM in the same way while mapping is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; false. (Hell - the assumption that any two people will interpret *any* </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; model the same way is probably false, too.)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I believe this is actually a good counterexample.&nbsp; While the terms and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; relations in a database representation don't have a formal semantics (note </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; that I didn't say SQL itself doesn't have a formal semantics), axiomatized </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; terms and relations in first order logic do.&nbsp; The axioms&nbsp; completely specify </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; the meaning of the term so there is not as much of an issue about people's </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; different interpretations.&nbsp; Of course, if the axioms are not detailed or </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; specific enough that's a problem just as it would be with any </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; underspecified representation.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I think THE most important issue is people's different interpretations.&nbsp; (See my second assumption above.)&nbsp; Regardless of the FOL language chosen to represent the ontology, human beings are still going to read the words/terms that are tokens in the FOL representation and apply natural language interpretations to them.&nbsp; There is no getting away from this -- we are trapped using natural language - ultimately - to articulate and interpret meaning (i.e., real world domain semantics).&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When a new &quot;node&quot; is added to the community of integrated &quot;nodes&quot; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; mapped to a common NM, the mappings of all the nodes need to be reviewed </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; to see if they still &quot;interpret&quot; the NM properly given the expansion of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; its semantic applicability with/for the new node.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; I would have to disagree with this as well.&nbsp; The interpretation of a term </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; does not change just because some additional term is added to the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; ontology.&nbsp; All the past mappings would still be correct.&nbsp; The only issue </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; would be whether the mappings are specific enough and take appropriate </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; advantage of the presence of a new term.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I guess we'll have to settle for the old &quot;agree to disagree&quot; conclusion, then, because my fundamental assumptions lead me to the opposite position.&nbsp; I think it is very likely, in not inevitable, that the interpretation of a new term could cause &quot;interpretive ripples&quot; through a collection of mapped ontologies.&nbsp; It's the same phenomena as a new person coming into your committee meeting half-way through: there's a temporary pertubation of the discussion while the new person &quot;comes up to speed&quot; with what's transpired so that he/she can then fully and fruitfully participate and contribute.</FONT></P>
<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;Off the top of my head, these are just some of the problems with a neutral </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;model integration approach.&nbsp; These problems can be overcome </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;methodologically, of course, but the depth and dimensions of the problem </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;are, I think, still poorly understood (if not mostly unrecognized).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;While I think you can sell the neutral ontology integration model as a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;problem solving approach, getting people to know about and use SUMO (or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;any other &quot;upper&quot; ontology) as neutral ontology in their solution is a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;different kind of sales job altogether.&nbsp; And it is one that I don't think</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;will be very successful - any well-defined and well-bounded integration</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;effort will want to use their own.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you discuss further why you feel they'd want to use their own?&nbsp; I've</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; found that unlike in the research world, people who want to accomplish a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; practical commercial task are very happy to adopt someone else's models or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt; &gt; software if it helps them get their job done.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;But in adopting someone else's models or software, how often do they use </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;them exactly as is?&nbsp; I don't know how often I've heard &quot;My/our </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;requirements are different&quot;.&nbsp; At the very best, they would use the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;models/software as a starting point for doing what they want to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;do.&nbsp; Adopting and adapting a neutral ontology model to the usage and needs </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;of your local (integrated) community defeats the whole purpose of using it </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;as a generalized integration model.&nbsp; People will interpret and use the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;model as they wish, and this can't be policed (and shouldn't because it is </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;not wrong of them do this - it's natural.)&nbsp; The only way &quot;standardized&quot; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;interpretations will arise is by the conventions that arise and are </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;reinforced in a language-use community, in which case it will pay for </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;people to interpret the ontology the same way.&nbsp; (Remember: dictionaries </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;don't specify the meaning of words; they document the conventional </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;meanings of usages of a word.)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Well, we're drawing on the anecdotes of personal experience here, not </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; having the results of some survey that specifies how various groups of </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; people use various types of software.&nbsp; </FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>True enough.&nbsp; I know of little realistic &quot;research studies&quot; in this field.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;I would only try to support my view </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; further with the fact that the vast majority of Java programmers use, and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; subclass the JDK, rather than feeling a need to modify it.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>And my view stems from a different set of experiences, e.g., modelling the information requirements of domain experts for the purpose of representing and exchanging data between CAD systems.&nbsp; My response to your Java example is that Java and the behavior of computing machines is a (relatively) well-understood domain compared to the knowledge in the &quot;real world&quot;.&nbsp; Therefore the programmers that subclass the JDK already know what the classes could/should do and how to apply them.&nbsp; You give the same programmers a class diagram ostensbility representing domain knowledge, like people or parts or products, and they will each interpret them - differently - as they see fit in their applications.&nbsp; (Again - that has been my consistent and unvarying experience.)</FONT></P>
