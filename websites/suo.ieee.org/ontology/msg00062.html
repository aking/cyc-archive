&gt;[Adam:]
&gt;Pat,
&gt;  I think that you're arguing with a point that hasn't been 
&gt;asserted.  I don't think anyone would claim that the goal of the SUO 
&gt;is to create the "One True Ontology".  I would say that our goal is 
&gt;to create a "Good Enough Ontology".  There may be alternate ways to 
&gt;formalize concepts and we should make reasonable engineering choices 
&gt;to pick one decent solution and move forward.
&gt;  I'd suggest that if we come up with a product that's reasonably 
&gt;general and correct that we'll have a much better product than if 
&gt;we, on the one hand, created a host of different and incompatible 
&gt;formalizations or, on the other hand, spent eons searching for the 
&gt;one correct way to formalize every representational issue.


&gt;&gt;&gt;[Chris Partridge:]
&gt;&gt;&gt;.....
&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a general point that I think and others have raised before. Unless
&gt;&gt;&gt;we get agreement on the high level structure (the ontological paradigm) and
&gt;&gt;&gt;this will involve hard choices then I do not see how we can expect to
&gt;&gt;&gt;amalgamate the lower level theories.

Adam, thanks for the comment. However, I honestly cannot reconcile 
what you say with what Chris says. What is "the ontological paradigm" 
if it is not the One True Ontology? OK; never mind "True", thats a 
red herring. My point was that there isnt going to be (for the 
reasons which Chris outlined so cogently in his original message) one 
Good Enough Ontology, if 'good enough' means that it will accomodate 
all ontological perspectives reasonably well. You seem to think that 
this is like choosing a standard notation, but it's more like taking 
a definite position on every deep question in philosophical analysis 
for the last two thousand years, and declaring that particular 
combination of philosophical perspectives to be 'good enough' for 
everyone to use for any reasonable purpose. Why do you think that 
people have been arguing about this for so long, if they felt that 
one or another position was 'good enough'? You have probably hundreds 
of conceptual clashes in the KIF axiom files you already have gotten 
done.

The ontological differences are very basic and very real, and they 
permeate all axiom-writing. Take time for example, and never mind all 
the various temporal ontologies (interval- or point-based, dense or 
discrete or continuous, etc.), but focus on a more wide-ranging 
issue: how do the basic entities of the (wider) ontology fit into 
time? Do the axioms refer to things which endure through time, and 
consider these a fundamentally different kind of entity than things 
which happen at a time? Do they assume that truths are asserted at a 
time (and hence are implicitly or explicitly tensed) or are the 
assertions themselves timeless, and asserted about temporally located 
things? When the properties of something change with time, does one 
indicate this by referring to the time at which they hold, or does 
one regard the relations and properties as holding of temporal 
'slices' of the things, or does one refer to the changes explicitly? 
All of these questions (and others) need to be answered, and the 
answers one gives will have consequences throughout the SUO (one 
cannot keep this genie bottled up in a temporal ontology); and there 
are no right or wrong answers. You can do it either way, in all these 
cases. Some things are easier to say in some ways than others; some 
things are unsayable in some combinations of answers, but those 
combinations are recommended by weighty ontological authorities armed 
with truckloads of scholarship, so you are going to have some mighty 
battles ahead. (Guarino agrees with Aristotle that all events 
ultimately derive from enduring continuants; other living 
philosophers agree with Heraclitus that the primary mode of existence 
is flux, so things supervene on events. People will still be arguing 
about this two millenia from now. Practical folk use whichever 
viewpoint is handiest, but then they don't have to be logically 
consistent.) Whatever you decide, you had better get it done soon, as 
most of these files of axioms being produced will need to be entirely 
re-written, since every author writes axioms based on their own 
idiosyncratic answers to these (and other) questions, and their 
particular assumptions are built into their very way of thinking, and 
not made explicit, but are inconsistent with other author's implicit 
answers. (You have Barry Smith's boundaries ontology axioms. Are 
there temporal boundaries as well as spatial? Do boundaries endure, 
or would one describe this by saying that the temporally enduring 
thing has a spatiotemporal boundary? What kind of boundary is a 
moving weather front, behind which thunderstorms can be expected this 
afternoon?)

Guarino's mereology isnt compatible with Simon's, and neither of them 
are compatible with Tarski (last time I looked), so y'all had better 
decide which you want to believe. Most of the mereological accounts 
of space do not allow things like lines, surfaces or points to occur 
in the domain of discourse, and rapidly generate inconsistencies if 
they are allowed in, so you had better not meet anyone who wants to 
talk about the length or shape of a boundary line. (Check the Cyc 
geography axioms pretty carefully, and be prepared to re-think them 
one at a time; and check out things like #$SheetLikeObject.) Holes 
require something like pieces of space in the ontology. Are they 
material or not? If you fill up a hole with water, is the hole full? 
(Since the only reasonable answer is 'yes and no', does this mean 
there are two notions of 'hole', or two notions of 'full'? How 
exactly do they differ?) Can one divide a hole in half? (Casati and 
Varsi say not, butif a hole is a piece of space you certainly can, eg 
consider the space occupied by the water in a flooded tunnel which is 
half-full of water.) These various differences arent the result of 
bugs or sloppiness: they reflect different ontological perspectives. 
(For example, Cyc doesnt make any firm distinction between a thing 
and the space it occupies, whereas most mereologies make a very sharp 
distinction.) There isnt going to be a single UO which allows them 
all to coexist, and if you try to take a bit from one and a bit from 
another you will just get incoherence and muddle. There isnt a single 
'reasonably general and correct' ontology: there are many ontologies, 
all general and all with as valid a claim to be 'reasonable and 
correct' as all the others, but sharply incompatible with each other. 
Some ambitious folk want their ontology to include a distinct entity 
for every fact that can be asserted in the language (Jerry Hobbs 
calls these 'eventualities'), which is going to be inconsistent with 
any SUO that anyone produces. So, in spite of your protests, you ARE 
going to have to decide on a one true ontology, or at any rate a one 
standard ontology; and if that word "standard" is going to have any 
real meaning, then it might as well be written "true", since 
obviously the point here is to say that you can have any ontological 
color as long as it's black.

Best wishes

Pat

PS. [Actually an alternative strategy would be to explicitly include 
all the alternatives into the SUO, using some kind of 'context' 
mechanism, maybe (?) To be really useful however this would need to 
be more powerful than the 'micro-theory' notion used in Cyc, which is 
really only a namespace-management tool. You would want to have 
axioms relating the various notions of 'part' in different 
ontologies, or the various ways of referring to time and change, in 
the form of mappings between contexts. It would go way beyond 
SUO-KIF, for sure.]
