NEW ARTICLES

Ben Goertzel, an old acquaintaince of ours, has written an 
easy-to-read review of PCP for the big German newspaper "Frankfurter 
Algemeine Zeitung". His article, entitled "The Principia Cybernetica 
Project: Placing the Web at the Center of Man's Quest for Knowledge", 
can be found at: 
<A  HREF="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/PrincipiaCybernetica.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/PrincipiaCybernetica.htm</A>
=46or the same newspaper, Ben has also written profiles of PCP editors 
V. Turchin and F. Heylighen: see <A  HREF="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/</A>

=46rancis Heylighen has written an in-depth review of PCP for the 
journal "Foundations of Science". It summarizes the motivation behind 
the project, its basic philosophical assumptions, and the practical 
methods and experiences behind the project's organization. This 
"Foundations and Methodology for an Evolutionary World View" is 
available at <A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/PCPworldview-FOS.pdf">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/PCPworldview-FOS.pdf</A>

Another new paper by Heylighen, provides a quick review and 
introduction of web learning and spreading activation, the methods we 
developed to create a "global brain", coupled with a review of 
psycholinguistic research on associations between words: "Mining 
Associative Meanings from the Web: from word disambiguation to the 
global brain". It is available at: 
<A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MiningMeaning.pdf">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MiningMeaning.pdf</A>


GROWTH OF PCP-WEB

The number of hits on the main PCP server, <A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/</A>, 
hovers around 28 000 per day, which is a significant improvement 
since about a year ago. Yet, the number of hits on our Los Alamos 
mirror server, <A  HREF="http://pcp.lanl.gov">http://pcp.lanl.gov</A> is still only a fraction of that, 
showing that most people reach PCP-web via links pointing to the 
original server in Europe.

It is good that the links point all to the same, main address, 
because this makes our site more prominent for search engines, but we 
want to remind our readers that in many cases (especially for users 
in Latin America), they may get faster access through the mirror 
server in the US. To switch between servers, it suffices to click on 
the "Server: EU" or "US" option in the menu bar of the main PCP web 
pages.

It is interesting to compare the present hit rate with earlier ones, 
to study historical development. In 1994, one year after the creation 
of  PCP-web, we got a mere 400 hits a day. In the beginning of 1998, 
we had nearly 8000/day. This means that the number of hits roughly 
doubles every year. That  is a faster rate than the growth of the 
web, and it is interesting to look further into that trend and try to 
understand it.

Since the services we offer haven't grown that much during the period 
(and have actually declined relative to the overkill of special 
effects on other, commercial sites), it must be that our material has 
become more attractive to the average surfer. From the  increasing 
number of reactions we receive about PCP web, we get the  impression 
that what we are doing is more and more generally accepted  as an 
excellent, needed service, rather than an interesting and  somewhat 
eccentric idea.

  This may be due in part to the growing acceptance of "evolutionary" 
and "Darwinian" approaches in various domains, and the continuing 
growth of complex systems related ideas. In that general domain, we 
are still the only ones that offer an integrated, philosophical 
outlook, but because of the better acceptance of 
evolutionary-systemic thinking, our philosophy seems less outrageous 
to the majority of people now. It appears our time has come!

Just to stress the point, it is worth quoting one or two of the 
reactions we got recently. A reader from Indonesia, who would like to 
translate some of our documents to Indonesian, notes:

"For months I've learned and inspired by your sites. It seem I was 
turn to a second live. I've found what I need in my live, at last. 
[...]
We need a new way of thinking, a new paradigm, but what is it? This 
is my question, before I found your site. Constructivism, autopoiesis 
theory, cybernetics, give answers to most of my questions. In the 
light of what you present in your web, I see how we can talk and 
discuss peacefully, how education can make an important contribution, 
etc. I can see everything in a very different way. A wat thay promote 
spontaneity, cooperation, tolerance, love, justice, equality and many 
others. [...]"

Another reader simply exclaims:

"No problems, just wanted to say THANK YOU!  I am a student in 
Systems Science, and this web site is incredible!"


JOURNAL OF MEMETICS

The journal (<A  HREF="http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/">http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit/</A>), which is associated 
with PCP, is going through some reorganization, as the present 
managing editor (Hans-Cees Speel) is about to retire. To replace him, 
two new editors have joined the board, Michael Best, a computer 
scientist from the MIT Media Lab, and Martin de Jong, a policy 
analyst from Delft University of Technology. It was proposed that 
during an interim period of six months, Michael and Martin would 
assist Hans-Cees in managing the paper reviews, in order to take over 
completely later on.

Two other members of the editorial board, Liane Gabora and Susan 
Blackmore, have asked to retire as they are too busy with other 
activities, but they will normally remain as members of the advisory 
board. Several people have been nominated to join the editorial 
board, and a general reorganization of the board's activities are 
planned, but these proposals must still be discussed in depth before 
they can be implemented.


GLOBAL BRAIN

The Global Brain mailing list 
(<A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIN-L.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/GBRAIN-L.html</A>) is becoming more active 
lately. Out of this activity, at least one concrete plan has emerged: 
to organize a conference on the Global Brain. At present, an 
organizing committee is being constituted. It will include PCP 
editors Francis Heylighen and Cliff Joslyn, and Global Brain Group 
members Ben Goertzel (overall chair) and Gottfried Mayer-Kress. The 
likely venue will be San Francisco, near Silicon Valley, and the 
proposed date would be the end of 2001. A Call for Papers and 
preliminary program are being prepared. They will be distributed via 
this and other mailing lists.

TOPICS ON PCP-DISCUSS

The following topics were announced or discussed on the PCP-discuss mailing
list (see <A  HREF="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MAIL.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MAIL.html</A>) during the last two 
months. There was a particularly extensive discussion on the election 
problems in Florida, and on Jaron Lanier's "anti-cybernetic" 
manifesto, which inevitably developed into the recurrent discussion 
of what can and cannot be modelled in science. The full text of all 
original messages and replies is available via the new PCP-discuss
