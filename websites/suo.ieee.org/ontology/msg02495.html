Adam,

Thanks for your comments. You are correct that the framework provided by the
SUO Dictionary does not enforce a requirement that all definitions be
statements in a formal, computable language. However, the framework does not
prevent such definitions, either. The SUO Dictionary is open for users to
contribute material in any form.

I see this as an advantage, not a limitation. While I agree that our goal
must be to have an ontology stated in a formal, computable language, to
supporting automated inference, etc., I think that in the early stages of
ontology development people may need some flexibility in how they create
their common working document(s), to allow exploration of new ideas.

Besides this flexibility, and openness to different notations, and different
levels of formalization, the other key requirements that I would propose for
a "SUO Common Ontology Development Architecture (CODA)" are:

web-enabled
open to input from multiple authors
an authors input is easily published on the web, directly by the author
readers can view any author's contributions
authors can only edit their own contributions
teams of people can collaborate to develop consensus definitions, or agree
to disagree
multiple ontology efforts / directions can be pursued in parallel
support for namespaces within each ontology effort

To the extent that the web-published database at

<A  HREF="http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;name=Entity&amp;caseS">http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;name=Entity&amp;caseS</A>
ensitive=on&amp;skb=Merge

meets these requirements, I would say it could be a good alternative to the
SUO Dictionary that I've developed (with advice from Robert Kent).

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Philip,
&gt;    We may have different understandings for what counts as "formal".  For
&gt; example, it appears to me that a human must read the English
&gt; definitions to
&gt; understand what each term means.  Robert has supplied axioms in his
&gt; explanatory text, but there is no structural requirement that
&gt; that be done.
&gt;    As examples, Ian Niles has merged Robert's ontology with his "merged
&gt; ontology".  Each of the axioms is shown in a browser that requires
&gt; statements in a formal language (although one can put comments in English
&gt; on terms as well).  If you look at
&gt; &lt;<A  HREF="http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;name=E">http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;name=E</A>
ntity&amp;caseSensitive=on&amp;skb=Merge&gt;
&gt; you'll see one of Robert's axioms:
&gt;
&gt; (=&gt;
&gt;    (instance-of ?x Entity)
&gt;    (not
&gt;      (and
&gt;        (instance-of ?x Class)
&gt;        (instance-of ?x Set))))
&gt;
&gt; Each term is hyperlinked so you can find the formal, logical
&gt; definition of
&gt; Class, Set, instance-of etc.  Most importantly, because the
&gt; definitions are
&gt; in a formal computable language, an automated inference engine can work
&gt; with these definitions without human assistance.  This is a
&gt; critical aspect
&gt; of the ontology, and part of our charter (see the phrase "...automated
&gt; inferencing..." from the scope and purpose).

&gt; &gt;Adam,

&gt; &gt; &gt; As a dictionary, quickbase looks quite useful.  I'm unclear
&gt; &gt; &gt; though as to how it might be suitable for development of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; formal ontology itself.  Could you elaborate?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for your question. Please consider some of the
&gt; definitions provided
&gt; &gt;by Robert Kent at:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;<A  HREF="https://www.quickbase.com/db/6urbwpxk?act=q&amp;qid=1">https://www.quickbase.com/db/6urbwpxk?act=q&amp;qid=1</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Robert has provided formal definitions for some elements of his IFF
&gt; &gt;ontology. These definitions include formulae, explanations, commentary,
&gt; &gt;links to further information, etc. The elements of IFF are specified as
&gt; &gt;belonging to ontology namespaces, which are defined and
&gt; interrelated using
&gt; &gt;the SUO "Ontology Modules" database.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;IFF itself is specified as an "ontology workspace", which is a
&gt; name for an
&gt; &gt;overall ontology effort, within which terms are being defined.
&gt; For example,
&gt; &gt;"Merged Ontology" could be an ontology workspace.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Users may define namespaces as they wish, or not use the
&gt; namespace feature
&gt; &gt;if they prefer. Users may develop their own notations to indicate that a
&gt; &gt;namespace occurs within a hierarchy of namespaces, or that an ontological
&gt; &gt;term is defined within a namespace.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Likewise, users may develop their own notations to define axioms
&gt; for a term,
&gt; &gt;and different notations could be used for different ontology efforts /
&gt; &gt;workspaces.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Because the database is open for access, and web-enabled, it
&gt; should support
&gt; &gt;collaboration by people working together to develop a formal
&gt; ontology. Each
&gt; &gt;workspace in the database is effectively a common document for people
&gt; &gt;working on development of an ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Even so, the SUO Dictionary is a very new effort -- Perhaps as a common
&gt; &gt;framework for developing an ontology it is incomplete or
&gt; imperfect in some
&gt; &gt;respects. I'd appreciate any feedback, comments, questions, suggestions,
&gt; &gt;that you or others may have. Quite possibly it can be improved
&gt; in some way,
&gt; &gt;or maybe it is destined for failure because of some fundamental flaw that
&gt; &gt;I've overlooked -- either way, the sooner I learn this, the better.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       These items will probably cut down on the volume, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; without one or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more documents to focus on, we won't be making much progress.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree, and would like to note that we now have a web-enabled
&gt; &gt; &gt; framework for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;developing a common, documented definition of a standard
&gt; upper ontology,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with examples of its use provided by Robert Kent. It's at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<A  HREF="https://www.quickbase.com/db/6urbwpxk">https://www.quickbase.com/db/6urbwpxk</A>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Perhaps to make clear that it is intended to be used for
&gt; this purpose, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;should rename it something like "SUO Common Ontology Development
&gt; &gt; &gt; Framework",
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;insted of "SUO Dictionary" (?) -- Readers may still think it
&gt; is just a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;glossary, to be developed and used as an appendix or
&gt; &gt; &gt; afterthought -- rather,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I hope that SUO members will find it a useful tool in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; development of SUO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;itself. It can support collaboration in development of one or
&gt; &gt; &gt; more ontology
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;efforts, i.e. "merged ontology", "4D", "IFF", etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"Philosophy cannot become scientifically healthy without an immense

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with which their grandsires attempted to handle metaphysics and

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;before that day, it will have become indispensably requisite,
&gt; &gt; &gt; too, that each
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of these terms should be confined to a single meaning which,
&gt; &gt; &gt; however broad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;must be free from all vagueness. This will involve a revolution in
