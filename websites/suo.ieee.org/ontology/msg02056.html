Dear Chris,

Thank you for the comments and challenges below.

&gt; Greetings Matthew.
&gt; 
&gt; On Sat, 31 Mar 2001, West, Matthew MR SSI-GREA-UK wrote:
&gt; &gt; If you want to put a label on me, then I think extensionalist
&gt; &gt; is probably your best bet. What I mean by this is taking as an
&gt; &gt; identity criteria for things, that any two things with the same
&gt; &gt; extension are the same thing. (It might be more proper to say
&gt; &gt; that there are not two (or more) things with the same
&gt; &gt; extension).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The world then divides neatly into two basic sorts, sets
&gt; &gt; (including relations) and individuals (or particulars if you
&gt; &gt; prefer) where individuals are things that have an extension
&gt; &gt; in space time, and sets are things that have members.
&gt; 
&gt; That rules out the empty set.  

MW: Which of course I don't mean to. In fact I mean to follow the
work you have recently done, and then take the next step and use
only sets/classes with extensions.

&gt; Also, I'm not sure it's wise to
&gt; equivocate on "extension" as you do:  the extension of an 
&gt; individual for
&gt; you is (I take it) something like a 4D chunk of space-time, 
&gt; while the
&gt; extension of a set is the set of its members (i.e., the set itself).

MW: Correct.

&gt; Granted, for you, both types of extension are used to individuate
&gt; objects of the relevant sort, but to avoid confusion perhaps 
&gt; it's better
&gt; to talk instead about, e.g., the spatio-temporal *extent* or
&gt; *boundaries* (or the like) of an individual, rather than its 
&gt; extension.

MW: Interestingly, I am also being criticised by others for not
making more of extension as being a common concept across class
and individual where whole/part and subtype/supertype can be seen
as the same. I have sympathies with both sides.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One thing to note about this position is that any piece of
&gt; &gt; space time is an individual, just as any collection of things
&gt; &gt; is a set.
&gt; 
&gt; To say this, you need to make sure that your underlying set theory
&gt; doesn't yield the existence of proper classes, which are collections
&gt; that are *not* sets.

MW: Again my intent is to follow your foundation ontology, where so 
anywhere that I have used "set" you should substitute "class".

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; POSSIBLE WORLDS
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One of the key challenges for any viewpoint is how to model
&gt; &gt; what could be (past present and future), as well as what
&gt; &gt; is/has been. This is done using a "possible worlds" approach,
&gt; &gt; or more properly possible universes, in which spatio-temporal
&gt; &gt; parts can be shared between different possible universes. So
&gt; &gt; my life up to today can be part of any possible future I might
&gt; &gt; have.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A consequence of this (I believe) is that modal logic is not
&gt; &gt; required.
&gt; 
&gt; That's true -- one can express the usual semantics of modal 
&gt; languages in
&gt; a nonmodal language by quantifying directly over possible worlds and
&gt; possible individuals.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction if I
&gt; &gt; am not) the key constructs in KIF are:
&gt; &gt;  - constants
&gt; &gt;  - variables (and more generally lambda calculus)
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, there is no variety of lambda calculus in KIF.  (And I 
&gt; am puzzled
&gt; why you think the lambda calculus is a generalization of the 
&gt; notion of a
&gt; variable.)

MW: Well I may have misunderstood what Lambda Calculus is about, in
which case this is a good opportunity to learn my mistake.

I was under the impression that variable expressions like:

(forall ?x (=&gt; (car ?x) (has-wheels ?x)))

were lambda expressions largely because they did involve variables.
Please explain my error.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - predication
&gt; &gt;  - relation
&gt; &gt;  - some basic elements of logic
&gt; 
&gt; Well, this list (including the two elements above) sort of mooshes
&gt; together syntactic, semantic, and logical issues. The syntax, 
&gt; semantics,
&gt; and logic of KIF should be clearly expressed in the KIF spec 
&gt; forthcoming
&gt; Real Soon Now from the KIF working group.

MW: Yes, I think I am one chapter ahead of Graham, but that probably 
means I am only one or two chapters in to the logic bit.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The question is how do you choose to use these. The only 
&gt; thing that is
&gt; &gt; certain is that if you are not consistent you will store up trouble
&gt; &gt; for yourself.
&gt; 
&gt; Not much content there that one couldn't deduce a priori!  :-)

MW: So it is all the more surprising how often people don't even
give it consideration.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The choices I make are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - classes and individuals map to constants
&gt; 
&gt; I.e., both classes (sets?) and individuals are in the domain of
&gt; quantification 

MW: Yes. I know I need that.

&gt; (and, I take it, your quantification theory is
&gt; first-order).

MW: As I'm sure you know, this is beyond my knowledge. If I assume
that a quantification theory that is higher order implies a logic
that is higher order, then my position is as follows. I believe
(because people like you tell me) that there are significant
advantages to staying first order. Therefore my preference is
to remain first order until it can be demonstrated that critical
requirements can not be satisfied without moving from that. You
have said that these situations should not occur, or can be 
overcome, and I will buy that until the contrary is proved.
(see how trusting I am!)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - predication is used for set membership.
&gt; 
&gt; You mean you model predication in terms of set membership in the usual
&gt; way?  Ok.

MW: Yes, but I think in general a predicate is used as a property,
where this can be true at one time, and not at another. I do not
need this, since 4D takes time into account already.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - how one individual stands to another is modelled by relation
&gt; &gt;    instances
&gt; 
&gt; You mean you model one thing x standing in relation R to 
&gt; another thing y
&gt; by including the pair &lt;x,y&gt; in the set that represents (or, 
&gt; is identical
&gt; with) R (again, in the usual way)?  Ok.

MW: I said individual, you said thing. I meant only individuals,
sp not classes/sets. (but see below).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    note: only binary relations are used.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems bizarre to me to limit oneself in principle to binary
&gt; relations.  

MW: I do not set it as a restriction, it is onloy an observation.

&gt; Giving, for example, is a very natural 3-place relation.

MW: Giving is an activity, an activity is a spatio-temporal extent,
so an individual, so represented by a constant, not a relation. This
is part of the consisttency I was talking about.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    This is principally
&gt; &gt;    to minimise structural constraints where all places in a
&gt; &gt;    relation must be filled, when some are not known.
&gt; 
&gt; This makes no sense to me whatever.

MW: This is about data modelling issues, not logic issues, and if
it doesn't make sense, can be safely ignored (unless you design
databases).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - lambda calculus is used for defining constraints.
&gt; 
&gt; There are two major varieties of lambda calculus -- typed and 
&gt; untyped --
&gt; and I don't see that either is needed, or even usable, for ontology.

MW: I may misunderstand what Lambda Calculus is about, see above.

&gt; The typed lambda calculus is basically just omega-order logic 

MW: Omega-order logic? You lost me.

&gt; (i.e.,
&gt; roughly, there are in its intended semantics objects of every finite
&gt; order, and, in its language, variables that range over each order),

MW: You definitely lost me!

&gt; which takes us far beyond the expressiveness of first-order logic, as
&gt; well as the somewhat more expressive (proposed) extension of KIF
&gt; attained by the addition of row variables.  I had thought you 
&gt; wanted to
&gt; use a first-order framework.

MW: Yes, which is why I've probably not said what I meant. I mean
the apparatus that KIF provides for variable expressions.

(aside: did you hear about the baseball pitcher who complained to
his interviewer that the problem he had with the press was that
they printed what he said, not what he meant?)
&gt; 
&gt; The untyped lambda calculus (developed in by Church and Kleene in the
&gt; 30s) is an approach to computability theory (though, notably, has also
&gt; been used more recently in the semantics of natural language as the
&gt; basis of a theory of properties and relations).  The untyped calculus,
&gt; while powerful and flexible, is also mathematically very 
&gt; complex, and I
&gt; haven't seen anything in ontology that requires it.  Perhaps 
&gt; if you said
&gt; what a "constraint" is.  Are you simply talking about the ability to
&gt; define a class or relation by means of some condition like "x 
&gt; is red and
&gt; x is an apple"?  That only requires a reasonable class theory.

MW: That's about it. I thought that using variables at all implied
Lambda Calculus. When I say something strange about logic, don't
look for anything complicated or deep when ignorance will provide
an adequate explanation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;     In general these indicate how a member of one class 
&gt; must stand in
&gt; &gt;     respect to a member of another class.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see any connection between this statement and the lambda
&gt; calculus.

MW: Then there probably isn't one.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; note: relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are only
&gt; &gt;    allowed when the nature of the constraint they define is
&gt; &gt;    defined by a lambda expression.
&gt; 
&gt; Relations don't define anything; they are just (for you) sets 
&gt; of ordered
&gt; pairs.  And it is looking more and more like a constraint is just a
&gt; condition like the one above.  I think you should leave 
&gt; "lambda" out of
&gt; it!

MW: fine, (its all Greek to me!?) but what should I have said?
