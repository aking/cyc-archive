;; The following part of the ontology covers the various classes under 
;; 'Relation'.  Most of the content here is taken from frame-ontology, 
;; abstract-algebra, kif-relations, and kif-extensions (ontologies available

;; on the Ontolingua server).

(subclass-of Predicate Relation)
(documentation Predicate "A predicate is a set of tuples that represents 
a relationship among objects in the universe of discourse.  Each tuple 
is a finite, ordered sequence (i.e., list) of objects.  A relation is 
also an object itself, namely, the set of tuples.  
   Predicates are denoted by relation constants in KIF.  A fact that a 
particular tuple is a member of a predicate is denoted
by (&lt;relation-name&gt; arg_1 arg_2 .. arg_n), where the arg_i are the 
objects in the tuple.  In the case of binary relations, the fact can
be read as `arg_1 is &lt;relation-name&gt; arg_2' or `a &lt;relation-name&gt; of
arg_1 is arg_2.'  The relation constant is a term as well, which
denotes the set of tuples.")

(subclass-of Function Relation)
(documentation Function "A function is a mapping from a domain to a range 
that associates a domain element with exactly one range element.  The 
elements of the domain are tuples, as in relations.  The range is a class 
-- a set of singleton tuples -- and each element of the range is an 
instance of the class.  Functions are also first-class objects in the same 
sense that relations are objects: namely, functions can be viewed as sets of
tuples.")

to the objects denoted by N1,..., NK.  Otherwise, the value is undefined.")

(subclass-of RelationExtendedToQuantities Relation)
(documentation RelationExtendedToQuantities "A RelationExtendedToQuantities 
is a relation that, when it is true on a sequence of arguments that are real

numbers, then it is also true on a sequence of constant quantites with those
magnitudes in some units.  For example, the lessThan relation is extended to

quantities.  That means that for all pairs of quantities q1 and q2, 
(lessThan q1 q2) if and only  if, for some ?n and ?m, q1 = (MeasureFn ?n
?u), 
q2 = (MeasureFn ?m ?u), and (lessThan ?n ?m), for all units ?u on which q1 
and q2 can be measured.  There may be relations that are not instances of 
this class that nonetheless hold for quantity arguments.  To be a 
RelationExtendedToQuantities means that the relation holds when all the

connectedEngineeringComponents.  That means that whenever this relation 
holds between two components, there exists a connection component.
This is logical existence; this connection object may not be
present in the memory of a representation system.  Conversely,
if a representation system has allocated a data structure for
a connection object, it doesn't mean that it must explicitly
represent the implied connectedEngineeringComponents relationship.
The practical reason for reifying a relationship is to be
able to attached other information about it. For example, one
might want to say that a particular connection is associated with
some shared parameters, or that it is of a particular type.  Connection 
objects are components and can therefore be subcomponents of other
components.  However, to provide for modular regularity in component
systems, 
connection components cannot be connected.  For each pair of components 
related by connectedEngineeringComponents, there exists at least one
connection 
object.  However, that object may not be unique, and the same connection
object 
may be associated with several pairs of connected components.")

;; The following formulas incorporate the relations in the Quantities
ontology 
;; (developed by ITBM-CNR) and the units of measure in the "Standard 
;; Units" and "Standard Dimensions" ontologies on the Ontolingua server.

(subclass-of Quantity Abstract)
(subclass-of PhysicalQuantity Quantity)
(partition PhysicalQuantity 
(SetFn ?X (or (member ?X ConstantQuantity) (member ?X FunctionQuantity))))
(documentation PhysicalQuantity "A physical quantity is a measure of some 
quantifiable aspect of the modeled world, such as 'the earth's diameter' 
(a constant length) and 'the stress in a loaded deformable solid' (a 
measure of stress, which is a function of three spatial coordinates).  The 
first type is called constant quantity and the second type is called
function 
quantity.  All physical quantities are either constant quantities or
function quantities.  Although the name and definition of this concept
is inspired from physics, physical quantities need not be material.
For example, amounts of money are physical quantities.  In fact,
all real numbers and numeric-valued tensors are special cases of physical 
quantities.  In engineering textbooks, quantities are often called
variables.
   Physical quantities are distinguished from purely numeric entities
like a real numbers by their physical dimensions.  A
physical dimension is a property that distinguishes types of
quantities.  Every physical quantity has exactly one associated
physical dimension.  In physics, we talk about dimensions such as
length, time, and velocity; again, nonphysical dimensions such as
currency are also possible.
   The 'value' of a physical quantity depends on its type.  The value of
a constant quantity is dependent on a unit-of-measure.  Physical quantities 
of the type FunctionQuantity are functions that map quantities to other
quantities (e.g., time-dependent quantities are function quantities).")

(subclass-of ConstantQuantity PhysicalQuantity)
(documentation ConstantQuantity "A ConstantQuantity is a constant value of 
some PhysicalQuantity, like 3 meters or 55 miles per hour. Constant
quantities 
are distinguished from function quantities, which map some quantities to
other 
quantities.  For example, the velocity of a particle over some range of time

would be represented by a function quantity mapping values of time (which
are
constant quantities) to velocity vectors (also constant quantities).  All 
constant quantites can be expressed as the product of some number and a unit

of measure.  This is what it means to say a quantity `has a magnitude'.  For

example, 3 meters can be expressed as (MeasureFn 3 Meter), where meter is 
defined as a unit of measure for length.")

(subclass-of FunctionQuantity PhysicalQuantity)
(subclass-of FunctionQuantity Function)
(documentation FunctionQuantity "A FunctionQuantity is a function that maps 
from one or more constant-quantities to a constant-quantity.  The function 
must have a fixed arity of at least 1.  All elements of the range (ie,
values 
of the function) have the same physical-dimension, which is the dimension of
the function-quantity itself.")

(subclass-of ScalarQuantity ConstantQuantity)
(documentation Scalar-Quantity "A ScalarQuantity is a ConstantQuantity whose

magnitude is a real number.  An important property of scalar quantities is
that 
they form a field with respect to addition and multiplication (with proper
subclass restrictions).  The class of scalar quantities forms a partial
order 
with the lessThan relation, since lessThan is a RelationExtendedToQuantities

and lessThan is defined over the real numbers.  The lessThan relation is not
a 
total order over the class of scalar quantity since elements from some
subclasses 
such as length quantities are incomparable to elements from other subclasses
such 
as mass quantities.")

(subclass-of TimeDependentQuantity UnaryScalarFunctionQuantity)
(subclass-of TimeDependentQuantity ContinuousFunction)
(documentation TimeDependentQuantity "A unary scalar function of continuous
time.  
Maps a time quantity into another scalar quantity such as a temperature.
For 
example, a quantity that denotes 'the temperature of the top of the Empire
State 
Building' is a time dependent quantity since its value depends on the
time.")

(=&gt;
   (instance-of ?X TimeDependentQuantity)
   (nth-domain ?X 1 TimeMeasure))

(subclass-of Unit-Of-Measure PhysicalQuantity)
(documentation Unit-Of-Measure "A unit-of-measure serves as
a standard of measurement for some dimension. For example, the meter is 
a unit-of-measure for the length-dimension, as is the inch.  There is no 
intrisic property of a unit that makes it primitive or fundamental; rather, 
a system-of-units defines a set of orthogonal dimensions and assigns units 
for each.  Therefore, there is no distinguished class for fundamental unit 
of measure.  The magnitude of a unit-of-measure is always a positive real 
number, using any comparable unit.  Units are not scales, which have 
reference origins and can have negative values. Units are like distances 
between points on scales.  Any composition of units and reals using the 
MeasureFn functions is also a unit-of-measure.")
