Graham,
My objection is not to the person (Ian Niles).  I state this in the first
sentence of my note.  Perhaps closer attention to my note will clarify my
objections.

Bob

&gt; Dear Robert,
&gt;         .               Below, you were previously objecting to the document
&gt; being developed.
&gt;
&gt;         .       Now you seem to be objecting to the person.
&gt;
&gt;         .       Do you have any grounds to objecting to the person?
&gt;
&gt;         .       Since Ian is the ONLY person volunteering, what alternative
&gt; do you suggest regarding selection of a technical editor?
&gt;
&gt;         .       Does anyone else have any alternative positive suggestions?

&gt; I have no objection to Ian serving as editor of the merged ontology as long
&gt; as this is done informally.
&gt; If this is characterized as a formal role, I object on the basis previously
&gt; stated.

&gt;                 Jim,
&gt;                 I do not agree with many (probably most) of the statements
&gt; in your note of 03/01/2001. Perhaps a more productive approach would be see
&gt; what we can agree on.
&gt;                 1) I think we both agree that no official vote has been
&gt; taken.
&gt;                 2) Consensus is desirable in a WG.
&gt;                 3) Your proposed conclusions and actions do not proceed from
&gt; a official vote (i.e. no vote was taken).
&gt;                 Since there has been no vote, in order to adopt your
&gt; proposed actions you must seek unanimous consent (or make a motion for a
&gt; vote). In fact your announcement did ask if there were any objections. By
&gt; Robert's Rules, a single objection defeats a request for unanimous consent.
&gt;                 Let me propose a comprise. Take the actions you proposed,
&gt; but do it informally - just don't characterize1 them as official actions of
&gt; the WG. If others have ontologies they wish to post and request the
&gt; assistance of the WG to refine/develop them, allow them to do so -
&gt; informally and without the necessity of a vote.
&gt;                 Over time, a natural consensus will develop. Some postings
&gt; will receive much more attention, revision, critiques than others. When it
&gt; is clear that a large majority favors a particular approach, then it is time
&gt; for a vote to formalize this consensus. I suspect this will take more than a
&gt; year.
&gt;                 Bob
&gt;                 1 A statement should accompany the posting saying that all
&gt; are unofficial documents and none have precedence over others.
&gt; As I said of your proposed conclusions and actions, there are two ways to
&gt; make actions official
&gt; 1) some one makes a motion, some one else seconds the motion, a vote is held
&gt; and the motions passes
&gt; 2) by unanimous consent (technically general consent).
&gt; No motion has been made ; no vote has been taken and I have objected which
&gt; defeats general consent2
&gt; The vote on the merged ontology was not official and no official actions can
&gt; be derived from it. I do not object to informal actions regarding the merged
&gt; ontology or its editor. Formal actions that give status to one document over
&gt; others must be formally taken and none of the actions you have taken are
&gt; correct by Robert's Rules - the official standard for procedure.
