&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; I sympathize with your concerns:
&gt; 
&gt; JA&gt;   Axioms : Theory :: Grammar : Language?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     But this is only true if we have a decent axiom set
&gt; &gt;     for a content domain and when we have a full grammar
&gt; &gt;     for a language, which we may have in artificial cases,
&gt; &gt;     but never really have in the empirically natural cases.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree.  In my earlier note, I waa using the term "theory" in the
&gt; sense of a deductive closure of a set of axioms.  That means that
&gt; all the theories I was discussing (and the contexts, which contain
&gt; them) are artificial in the same sense that predicate calculus is
&gt; an artificial language compared to English or any ohter NL.
&gt;
&gt; JA&gt;   So the claim that any accumulated empirical corpus of
&gt; &gt;     information about being, data about what is, which is
&gt; &gt;     to my way of thinking the primal form of any ontology,
&gt; &gt;     can be supplanted by any of our currently developed
&gt; &gt;     and very partial theories about being, well, that
&gt; &gt;     is just not a sensible suggestion.  And yet this
&gt; &gt;     working assumption is explicitly set out by some
&gt; &gt;     and even more presumptively taken for granted as
&gt; &gt;     an unreflective and uncritical rationale by others.
&gt; 
&gt; Any artificial theory (and its formally specified domain of discourse)
&gt; is at best an approximation to some natural domain, which can never
&gt; be fully axiomatized in any finite representation.  That is also true
&gt; of every theory in every branch of science and every engineering design
&gt; that has ever been (at best partially) implemented in some artifact.
&gt; 
&gt; JA&gt;   The notion that logic is just a species of semiotic ...
&gt; &gt;     and so I have to treat the genesis of ontology as prior
&gt; &gt;     to theory proper.
&gt; 
&gt; I would prefer not to use the word "ontology", except as a buzzword
&gt; that has become popular in circles that are providing research funds.
&gt; Aristotle didn't use it, and the nineteenth century Germans who made
&gt; it popular in philosophy were trying to distinguish theories of
&gt; "being as such" from the study of beings in the natural sciences.
&gt; 
&gt; I regard that move as fundamentally flawed -- Aristotle properly
&gt; placed metaphysics after physics, and I don't believe that ontology
&gt; can be or should be separated from physics (except as an expedient for
&gt; keeping any single book from becoming too big to be held in one hand).
&gt; 
&gt; JA&gt; 3.  As far as context goes, then, I cannot treat it
&gt; &gt;       in the first instance primarily as a parameter
&gt; &gt;       indexing theories, though maybe something more
&gt; &gt;       like a constraint on the POV of a given agent,
&gt; &gt;       but I have to see it as a factor that affects
&gt; &gt;       the transition from sign to interpretant sign
&gt; &gt;       in the relevant sign relation, and all of this
&gt; &gt;       stage-setting prologues the entrance of logic
&gt; &gt;       and theory, as full-blown characters, at least,
&gt; &gt;       onto the scene.
&gt; 
&gt; I was using the word "context" as a technical term.  My preferred
&gt; definition is given in the CG standard:  a concept node that contains
&gt; a nested conceptual graph.  I am willing to generalize that term to
&gt; include any notation for bracketing an excerpt of language (any kind
&gt; of language) that is under discussion.
&gt; 
&gt; Following is the beginning of my context paper, which discusses the
&gt; ambiguity of the word "context" and my preferred interpretations:
&gt; 
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/contexts.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/contexts.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; The technical term refers to the purely syntactic function
&gt; of bracketing some text in a natural or artificial language.
&gt; The other, derived uses, are even more important, but I would
&gt; prefer to use other terms for them.
&gt; 
&gt; John Sowa
&gt; ________________________________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Search for a Theory of Contexts
&gt; 
&gt; The notion of context is indispensable for any theory of meaning, but
&gt; no consensus has been reached about the formal treatment of context.
&gt; Some of the conflicting approaches result from an ambiguity in the
&gt; informal senses of the word.  Dictionaries list two major senses:
&gt; 
&gt;  * The basic sense is a section of linguistic text or discourse that
&gt;    surrounds some word or phrase of interest.
&gt; 
&gt;  * The derived sense is a nonlinguistic situation, environment, domain,
&gt;    setting, background, or milieu that includes some entity, subject,
&gt;    or topic of interest.
&gt; 
&gt; The word context may refer to the text, to the information contained
&gt; in the text, to the thing that the information is about, or to the
&gt; possible uses of the text, the information, or the thing itself. The
&gt; ambiguity about contexts results from which of these aspects happens
&gt; to be the central focus. These informal senses of the word suggest
&gt; criteria for distinguishing the formal functions:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Syntax.  The syntactic function of context is to group, quote,
&gt;     delimit, or package a section of text.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Semantics.  The quoted text of a context may describe or refer to
&gt;     some real or hypothetical situation. That nonlinguistic referent,
&gt;     which may also be called the context, constitutes the derived
&gt;     meaning of the term.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Pragmatics.  The word "interest", which occurs in both senses
&gt;     of the English definition, suggests some reason or purpose for
&gt;     distinguishing the section of linguistic text or nonlinguistic
&gt;     situation. That purpose is the pragmatics or the reason why the
&gt;     text is being quoted.

John,

In what sort of conceptual framework could one first begin to carry out
comparative and structural, perhaps even dynamic and developmental studies
of different belief systems, knowledge bases, ontologies (with the sense of
information about what is, or what is supposed to be), mythologies, theories,
or whatever you want to call them?  This conceptual staging ground would not
yet be a fixed theory itself, but would only be expected to supply the basic
equipment for investigating various theories that are set forth.  It would
need a concept of signs that is general enough to include sentences, like
axioms and theorems, but also far more rudimentary species of expression.
It would need a way to talk about sequences of signs, trajectories through
syntactic spaces, whether these were free associations, streams of reveries,
or logical proofs.  Within the genera of signs and sign processes that it gave
us the wherewithal to describe, to record, to organize, and to begin to analyze,
there would need to be room for many different species of semiotic forms of life.
But the more regimented and the more routinized forms of logic and theory would
constitute only one peculiar species of formal and normative activity within
this whole realm that I have been suggesting that we recognize as the world
of sign relations.  My own conclusion is that we will not have the setting
that we need to compare and contrast different ontologies, in a way that
does not force them to compete for living space in our minds, unless we
adjoin that all-important third column to our implicit data bases of
objects and signs, and unless we learn how to use it wisely.  This is
what I mean by taking the interpreter, the participant observer, into
account, and "context" is yet another, slightly distracting, as it turns
out, word for trying to point to the habitation of this interpretive agent.
But we cannot really expect this rara avis to have very nice nesting properties,
and here is where Peirce had a better grasp of the situation than Morris or Tarski,
as I have tried, almost to the point of despair, to indicate, many, many times now.
This is all stuff that I worked out fifteen years ago when I set to serious work
on formal pragmatics, and it is what has brought me to my current course, but
I guess that everybodies just have to persist in their own way until they hit
the wall or else evaporate into space.  Maybe that is just the human condition.
But where is that much-promised pre-established harmony when you really need it?
