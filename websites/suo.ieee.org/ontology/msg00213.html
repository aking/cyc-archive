A major purpose of the SUO is to establish a foundation for sharing,
reusing, and calibrating the ontologies of independently developed
systems that need to interoperate.

A precise, formal notation, such as KIF, is necessary for stating
the definitions and axioms.  But long before we get to the stage
where we can begin writing anything formal, it is necessary to
negotiate (usually in a natural language) what we need to formalize.

As an example of the problems involved, I would like to cite the
recent story about the discovery of the source of the Amazon River:

  <A  HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm</A>

The Amazon River has been known to western explorers for nearly
500 years, but its source was not discovered until 1971, and all the
controversies had not been resolved until now.  Following are the
kinds of options that the explorers had to consider:

   Smithsonian Institution geographer Andrew Johnson said the source
   of the Amazon could be defined as the most distant point in the
   drainage basin from which surface water ran year round, or the
   furthest point from which water could possibly flow to the Atlantic.
   "The Nevado Mismi fits both of these definitions," said Johnson.

Note that people have been talking about the Amazon and "its source"
for centuries before they had a clear idea of the definition of "its
source" or the actual referent of that term.  Yet people have been
able to talk effectively about those undefinited and unknown entities,
discuss alternate definitions, and plan expeditions to search for
the actual referents -- all without having a clear idea of what they
were looking for.

The following quotation from the above article gives some idea of
the size of a typical expedition:

   The NGS team included 22 members from the United States, Poland,
   Peru, Canada and Spain. They moved by foot, Jeep, bicycle and
   horseback to explore the five remote Andean rivers that combine
   to form the Amazon - the Apurimac, Huallaga, Mantaro, Maranion
   and Urubamba-Vilcanota.

Observation:  This level of effort is necessary to define nearly every
term in the ontology, ranging from the most general terms at the top
down to the referents of what Russell called "definite descriptions"
such as "the source of the Amazon".

I wanted to mention this example for two reasons:  The first is that
we are undertaking a very large task -- a point that has been noted
on this list many times from different perspectives.  The second is
that before any formal axioms can be written, a great deal of informal
analysis, study, discussion, negotation, and often very arduous and
back-breaking work must be done to determine exactly what is to be
formalized.
