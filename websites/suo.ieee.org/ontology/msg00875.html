&gt; Matthew,
&gt;    Could you give us the code for a few of those examples?  I 
&gt; think that 
&gt; would help everyone understand the EPISTLE model.

MW: I will try to give you an English explanation/analysis as to how it fits
to the EPISTLE Core Model - I think you have seen enough of my KIF by now to
know that it doesn't necessarily help that much.

&gt; &gt;Dear Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;know of a concept which cannot be subsumed by anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;presently in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ontology, please let me know.  This would be very useful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;information."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; How about:
&gt; &gt; &gt; an 'information-bearing object' (see my long comment in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; recent message);

MW: First let us consider the sorts of things that are "information bearing
objects". I will just list some illustrative examples:

 - a piece of paper with ink on it that forms words
 - a 3D CAD drawing of an aircraft carrier
 - a plastic model of an aircraft
 - the dance that a bee does when it returns to the hive to tell its
bretheren where a good source of nectar is.

These are somewhat diverse objects. the thing they have in common is that
they are spatio-temporal extents, though note that they include activities,
mathematical models, and physical models. Indeed they are all examples of
what in the EPISTLE Core Model we call state.

The nice thing about a state is that it is a minimalist concept. A blank
sheet on which to draw. The drawing is done by the way it is classified. Now
one of the ways we recognise a class is by what is common to a number of
objects. So if we take the pattern of the ink on paper as something that is
common to a number of pieces of paper (potentially) then it can be seen that
the information itself (the pattern) is a class. This probably doesn't sound
intuitive, but you probably would agree that information is abstract. We
have found that anything that you might properly talk about as being
absract, after some analysis turns out to be a class. The other thing that
is clear from this is that if the class is not embodied in an instance, then
there is no information.

So we have an entity (type) called class_of_information_representation whose
members are the content of one or more states. These are themselves members
of other classes that relate to the way the information bearing object has
the information encoded - including language, as well as broad
categorisations such as "document" "plastic model" "mathematical model" etc.
These instances are held in class_of_class_of_information_representation.

Of course information represents something, so we have
class_of_representation instances of which indicate that a member of the
related class_of_information_representation represents some thing. Note this
means that we can talk about the class_of_information_representation's as
well.

We have 3 subtypes (subclasses) of class_of_representation,
class_of_identification, class_of_definition, and class_of_description.

Any object can have another object that stands for it (identification).
Classes can have definitions, and individuals (spatio-temporal extents) can
have descriptions.

We also have some bits specific to how information is held in computers
according to the data types that EXPRESS allows, for infortion that is
internal, rather than external.

&gt; &gt; &gt; a piece of a certain kind of cloth which was used in evidence
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a trial;

MW: Well the piece of cloth is clearly a whole_individual (in the sense of
not being just a temporal part of some other thing), an actual_individual
(not just possible) a single individual (i.e. not a fusion of scattered
parts) and a state. Looking at the subtypes of state it is a physical
object, and of its subtypes it is a materialised_physical_object, which
means it has essential material continuity (as opposed to a
function_physical_object such as the chairman of Shell to which there are
material discontinuities).

MW: Chris Partridge, Jon Sowa and Pat Hayes have separately commented on the
benefits of a number of orthogonal classifications, rather than a single
classification hierarchy. The dimensionality of the above analysis (so far)
is 4, and not limited to 4.

MW: There are at least 2 state of the cloth that will be of interest. The
state (1) when it was involved in the crime, and the state (2) as it is used
in evidence. Taken simply, the crime is an activity, and the state (1) would
be classified by the role it played in the crime. State (2) would be
classified as its role as evidence in the trial. One of the obejctives would
presumably be to be establish that the two states were temporal parts of the
same piece of cloth. You might expect different possible histories of the
piece of cloth to be presented by the prosecution and defence, These would
be different possible spatio-temporal extents (states), which both had the
state (2) piece of cloth as parts (note the intersection of possible worlds
is tricky).

&gt; &gt; &gt; the color of that piece of cloth;

MW: simply a class that the piece of cloth (or some temporal part of it) is
a memebr of.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the act of breaking an egg by hitting it on the side of a bowl;

MW: This is an activity. The unbroken egg has its unbroken state terminated
by the breaking activity. The egg has its broken state started by the
breaking activity. There is a person, a temporal part of whom plays the
performer role in the activity, and the bowl, and more specifically a
feature of it - its side, which plays the role of a tool in the activity.

In the EPISTLE Core Model, an activity consists of the states of the
participating objects in the activity. An activity can cause the event,
which is the spatial boundary that begins or terminates a state. The states
that are the roles in the activity, will also be temporal parts of whole
individuals (the whole egg, the whole person, the whole bowl).

&gt; &gt; &gt; a style of dress used by a certain social class in
&gt; &gt; &gt; 17th-century France;

MW: This is just a class. In this case a class of physical object. You would
probably want to characterise those things that memebers of the class should
have in common, decolletage etc.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the shape of Marilyn Monroe's left ankle;

MW: Shapes are classes. Shape is an explicit subtype of
class_of_arranged_state. Clearly the shape would need some description. I
expect we sould know something up in a CAD system, but you might prefer a
photograph.

&gt; &gt; &gt; the cause of the Concorde disaster;

MW: Cause here is not quite the sense that we use it in EPISTLE, where it is
the direct cause of a change of state. Here the sense is in a chain of
events leading up to. I've explained how activity works in EPISTLE above,
and I think it is clear it can describe this through a series of activities
and events and states.

&gt; &gt; &gt; a dish (in the sense that Eggs Benedict is a dish, ie a something
&gt; &gt; &gt; that could be a menu item; as opposed to any particular example of
&gt; &gt; &gt; that dish, or the symbols on the menu describing it.)

MW: Interestingly, one of our managers is a foody, and what convinced him to
take us seriously was when we managed to show that we could model his
restaurant guide in an earlier version of the EPISTLE Core Model. He went on
to use our data modelling technology to develop Kalido (as in Kalaedoscope)
our Management Information System package.

MW: The "dish" itself is obviously a class. There would be particular
instances of it that would be states that were
materialised_physical_objects. So the concept "dish" would be a
class_of_class_of_physical_object.

MW: If we walk down the subtype tree, the dish is probably a
class_of_inanimate_physical_object. Though I would expect those classes to
have some axioms involving class_of_biological_matter.

MW: The dish will of course have a recepie, which is a list of ingredients,
and the definition of the process. This is all at the class_of_activity
level. There would be class_of_involvement relations indicating the required
roles for the activities and the classes_of_biological_matter (plus things
like salt) instances of which could play these roles - including quantities,
in instances of the activity. The order of the components of the activity
would be indicated by a class_of_sequence.

MW: You will notice that our work provides a 4D framework within which a
specific (4D)ontology can be developed. It does not have infinite detail. On
the other hand I think it is precisely such a framework that is needed as a
start point for ontology development.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That might do for a start. If you need more, let me know.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Interestingly, I'm pretty certain all of that would fit into 
&gt; the EPISTLE
&gt; &gt;model I posted recently.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Email Ian to Fred Mon, 29 Jan 2001 on the same subject:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"If by "means of articulation of domains of interest for 
&gt; subtending
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ontologies", you mean that the upper-level ontology ought to

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;agree with you, and I think the merged ontology, as it
