Jim --

Based on your recent clarification, I will cast a "Yes" vote, with
comments.

I would not want a "no" vote to contribute to stopping this work.  This
merged ontology is the most tangible sign of progress that we have to
offer.

I hope that a "yes" vote is not interpreted to mean that the merged
ontology is ready for some final wordsmithing into "standards words", as
seems to be implied in the definitions below.  It seems to me that the
merged ontology may be more of a working paper as defined below, but if we
have to vote thumbs up or thumbs down to continue the work, I opt for
thumbs up.

I am concerned that "standards words" will never be appropriate for this
work.  Since are talking about a machine-interpreted artifact, I'm not sure
that any of the categories noted below actually apply to this work.

I would also hope that at some time a major emphasis of the SUO would be
articulation of domains of interest for subtending ontologies.  This is
"upper" in a different sense than what is represented in the merged
ontologies.

Subject:  SUO: Vote on Merged Ontology as a 'Base Document' for SUO WG




SUO Participants,

1. Attached is the latest version of Ian Niles'  Merged Ontology.

2. This message is a call for a vote as to whether this document should be
approved as a 'Base Document' for IEEE P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology
Working Group.  Within IEEE, there is no official definition of a Base
Document; however, the definitions below from the IEEE Learning Technology
Standards Committee (our original sponsor) are as good as any.

3. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of consensus we have
for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need to decide if
we
are going to go down this path or not.  Multiple base documents are
possible, so anyone else is free to submit one.

4. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose improvements to the
document, unless they are major enough for you to vote against focusing
work
on this document.  However, such general improvement comments are welcome
and will be resolved (but not until after completion of this Base Document
vote).

5. Since we are still in the process of establishing official voting
rights,
I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw poll, such that
anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if consensus is not
clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote (once voting
rights are established).

6. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), NO (comments
required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).

7. Please send your votes directly to me (to reduce list traffic), though
you may send them to the entire list if you desire.

8. Please vote by Jan 29, 2001.

9. Please send in any questions or comments.

Jim Schoening
Chair, SUO WG

IEEE LTSC Nomenclature of Documents

working paper: Does not automatically get agenda time. Not necessarily
related to standards words (e.g., liaison reports, the agenda itself). A
working paper is any document with a document number or a document
introduced at a meeting (assuming the WG accepts it as a working paper).
Working papers don't automatically receive agenda time. The WG Chair may
choose to give higher agenda priority to discussion on working papers
received two weeks prior to the meeting. (Members may object to discussion
on papers with less than two weeks notice, but the objection is based on
the
need to digest the document, not to obstruct the process; and the objection
may prevent the paper from get agenda time, but not necessarily prevent the
discussion -- be considerate both ways, the chair will rule.)

base document: Starting point for standards words (it's clear the document
*can* be transformed into standards words). Has no official weight (not a
standard). Might not be in standards wording. Might not be complete with
respect to the scope and/or final standard. Might be multiple base
documents. Automatically allocated agenda time since this is the main
product of the WG. Most base documents represent substantial work created
outside the committee and introduced into the WG.

working draft: The base documents (assuming more than one) are combined
over
time. The combination document now becomes a working draft. The working
draft is refined and polished. The working draft is adapted to the style
guides. Working drafts may be available to the public. Automatically
allocated agenda time (the rest below all have agenda time).
base document vs. working draft: There may be multiple base documents that
become the starting points for a standard. There is only one working draft
for a standard (but many revisions, each with its own document number). A
base document identifies the origin of the work for several reasons:
technical, rationale, intellectual property, acknowledgement.

committee draft: The working draft is now in the style of a standard. The
document substatially represents the intended final standard. Changes may
be
made. There may be several committee drafts.
working draft vs. committee draft: Each revision of the working draft
represents a batch of edits that the WG accepts. Typically, there is a new
working draft each meeting while the document is being developed, but
working drafts may be less frequent. Committee drafts are important
milestones because they represent to the public "this is what the final
standard will look like". Working drafts may be available or not to the
public. Committe drafts are public. Working drafts may be used to solicit
public comments. Committee drafts are always used to solicit public
comments.

draft standard: The document is *complete*. There may be minor editoral
changes, but no substantive changes are intended. Draft standards may be
referred to (i.e., incorporated by reference) in *other* standards.
approved standard: The document is now an official standard.

Summary: Committee members submit working papers. Working papers may be
related to committee work, technical contributions, and so on. Base
documents are working papers approved as a "base document". One or more
base
documents may be part of a standard. When base documents are revised they
become a new working paper but with the automatic agenda item. At some
point
the working papers and/or base documents are combined to become a working
draft. Later on, additional working papers and additional base documents
may
be added to the working draft. Working drafts may be made available for
public comment. Committee drafts represent the full intention of the
standard. Committee drafts are available for public comment and are likely
to be balloted (comments from voting and non-voting members). A draft
standard represents the completed standard in every way (wording, style,
layout, etc.) except that it is not official. An approved draft standard
becomes a official standard after a succesful ballot and a process review.
