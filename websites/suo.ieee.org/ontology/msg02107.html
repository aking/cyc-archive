Hi Adam, Pat, et al, 
	.			Am having problems with my e-mail, so sorry
if you've already received this. 

	.		 	Some of what you are saying below would be
improved by the alternative approach I was proposing. Other parts address
other matters. 

	.	I would suggest there is benefit to be gained by considering
"disagreements" as just alternative perspectives

	.	Further comments interspersed below, prefaced  "GH&gt;	".

Pat,
   Phooey!  (slightly more mature comments below):

At 10:16 PM 4/6/2001 -0700, pat hayes wrote:
AP&gt;&gt;Graham,
AP&gt;&gt;	I too am dismayed by the volume of discussion and the sense that
although individual contributors have benefited from the discussion, and a
rather small group is making progress on an ontology, that we're not working
together and making collective progress on a standard.

PH&gt;	Maybe you should learn from this observation, rather than regretting
it.

AP2&gt;	Just because we haven't yet found success is no reason to think it
impossible.  What lesson would you have me learn, and how should that lesson
follow from the SUO experience?

AP&gt;&gt;	I believe that the solution is not improved document management or
better tools but rather for folks to be specific and concrete in developing
a formal document expressing their preferred version of an upper ontology.

PH&gt;	I think it is simply a reflection of a fact of life: people do not
agree on ontological issues. They never have and they never will. Regretting
this is like regretting that people speak different languages. My mum is
sternly disapproving of the fact there there are people on the planet who
don't naturally speak the Queen's English, an attitude that rather reminds
me of yours towards the variety displayed on this very list. 

GH&gt;	Pat, May I suggest that what you seem to be talking about is a
multiplicity of temporal perspectives, rather than "disagreements". I
haven't particularly pondered this till now, but suggest we need to address
the major options, rather than choose one, since they are so very different,
and are appropriate for their own areas. It may be possible to find
structures capable of catering to more than one simultaneously, but I tend
to feel we will inevitably, and certainly initially, need to have
alternatives.

GH.&gt;	English seems to cope with the range of perspectives, and not
because it is not unambiguous. A controlled English would be able to cater
for it also, so I suspect SUO-KIF would be able to also. 

PH&gt;	Don't you think that a better attitude to this fact might be to find
a way to utilize it, rather than try to 'solve' the 'problem'?

AP2&gt;	Not at all.  People disagree when there is reason to do so, and find
ways of agreeing when there is reason to do so.  In the KIF working group we
have a compelling need to agree on a common language and semantics for the
language.  We might each have our preferences, but we're willing to give up
certain preferences here and there in order to reach consensus. 

GH&gt;	I feel perhaps some people will be more "idealistic" than this, and
feel they have fundamental principles they hold to be inviolate. That's why
we may need to have alternatives, at least until and unless we can find
structures to merge them. 

AP2&gt;	We don't all need to agree on every aspect of the SUO.  We merely
need to have a product we can accept as a result of a lot of give and take. 

AP&gt;&gt;  If you believe something specific is lacking in the Merged ontology
that Ian has been working on, suggest a new axiom, or set of terms. 

PH&gt;	Adam, speaking for myself, the major source of frustration is that
people do not seem to read what one writes. Have you actually understood
anything of what I wrote about what is wrong with the overall methodology of
Niles' effort? It cannot be cured by adding more bits to it, any more than
tossing a few more vegetables into a stew is going to turn it into a
souffle.

GH&gt;	Might I humbly suggest that the reason we don't read all the
contributions is that we're SWAMPED by all the content? I have trouble even
finding the time to file them in subject related file directories on my
computer, and probably read about 1 in 30 contributions other than threads I
am involved in. Basically I just see what's in the "preview window" on my
e-mail system, and react to that. 

GH&gt;	This is the whole reason I raised the problem we have. The volume of
discourse is OVERWHELMING, and, in my opinion, threatens to drown the
project.  

AP2&gt;	I've read your comments and I simply don't agree with your
criticisms.  Maybe I don't yet fully understand them.

AP&gt;&gt;	If some folks would prefer EXIST or some other basis for the
standard, then offer concrete extensions to it using the EBNF syntax defined
for it.  Formalisms without explanation or discussion may make it difficult
for some folks to communicate but discussion without formalisms will lead us
simply to more talk.
AP&gt;&gt;	I would like to applaud those folks who have been very concrete (and
forgive me for those who I have forgotten): Helena Sofia Pinto for
contributing an ontology of units and measures, Nicola Guarino and his
colleagues for their work on mereology, Pat Hayes for his detailed and
specific help on temporal axioms, Chris Menzel, David Whitten and Robert
Kent for their work on the "structural ontology". We should also thank John
Sowa, Achille Varzi, Roberto Casati, James Allen, Barry Smith, Stuart
Russell, Peter Norvig and all the unattributed contributors to the
Ontolingua repository.
AP&gt;&gt;	If everyone on this list would create just some small ontology of
even a dozen terms supported by axioms that has not yet been covered in the
merged ontology, we could make tremendous progress.

PH&gt;	No, we would simply have a larger and even more confused stew. The
axiomatizations would be incompatible with each other and would be based on
sharply different views of the world. Surely this is vividly clear from the
postings on this list? Matthew West's axioms would talk of 4-d entities and
be based on a solid physical nominalism; Lee Auspitz' axioms would assume a
tensed ontology and would take human experiences as their basic framework.
Others would write axioms which transliterate one of several different kinds
of English grammatical theory. We even seem to disagree on what words like
'set' and 'class' mean.

GH&gt;	Let me suggest a hypothetical exercise in which each of the various
temporal structures (eg. 3-D + time, 4-D, tensed ontology, etc)
independently. I would suggest they COULD all share many other aspects, such
as shape, purpose, who, where, etc. Thus, there could be parts in common,
and parts with alternatives. 

PH&gt;	You have thanked me for my contribution on temporal axioms, but I
wish you would not, since I regard the temporal axioms in Niles' document as
a crock, and would refer that my name not be associated with them. There is
no single generally useful axiomatization of time: that is why I wrote a
temporal CATALOG, setting out the ALTERNATIVES and noting the ways they were
INCOMPATIBLE with each other. I did that for a reason, not because I couldnt
think of anything else. 

GH&gt;	Can you point me to this contribution, please. If it is not too
large, I will have a go at assessing my reactions to it, and see whether it
seems to be compatible with my suggestion above. 

AP2&gt;	We may disagree on English terms but I'm not clear on which axioms
you disagree with.  In fact, although you've said often that you consider
the current merged ontology "incoherent" or, as above, that there are
sections that are "incompatible" with one another, I don't believe you've
given a precise characterization of what you mean by those words.  Do you
mean that the current ontology is logically inconsistent?  If so, let me
issue a friendly challenge: show a proof using the axioms in the merged
ontology which leads to a contradiction.  Let me issue an even stronger
challenge since if there are in fact any contradictions I suspect we can fix
them: show two proofs leading to contractions for which any fixes would
generate more contradictions.

GH&gt;	My reaction is that maybe any "incompatible" areas can be segregated
out into alternative perspectives. 

AP&gt;&gt;	This could also include domain-specific ontologies as the exercise
of linking such ontologies to the merged ontology will elucidate the general
areas that need to be developed.
AP&gt;&gt;	How about a practical semiotics of books, recordings and documents;

PH&gt;	Would it take a book to be a semiotic text with a physical encoding,
or a physical object (a continuant or a 4-d lifetime?) to which contentful
relations can be applied, or a kind of 'sum' of a physical entity plus a
nonphysical 'text', or a collection (what kind of collection?) of surfaces
bearing information-encoding marks, or...? (Please don't say 'all of these')
Some people think of books as things with a history, like old furniture.

GH&gt;	We cope with this in English. I suggest that if we develop a
sufficiently comprehensive structure. Basically you are talking about a set
of differing but related concepts with the same label. Surely a sound and
unambiguous structure can inflect ("old linguistic term") the symbol
differently for each concept. So long as one is prepared to put a fair
amount of effort into developing the inflection system, and apply it
rigorously, it will work. In fact, there has been some discussion about
inflection systems earlier on (tho' no-one may have thought of it that way),
and we can perhaps extend such a system to cover these additional purposes. 

GH&gt;	I would suggest one of the BIG problems with English in recent times
is a tendency to abandon inflections, and rely on context to interpret
English. Even some SUO participants seem to take a delight in omitting
apostrophes, etc. Sometimes I feel cynical, and interpret this as an attempt
to maximise the ambiguous potentials of the language, and then be able to
argue that one can't have an unambiguous controlled version of it. 

AP2&gt;	These are exactly the sort of questions the author of an ontology of
semiotics should ask, and answer.  That they have not been answered in this
discussion group should not suggest that they can't be answered
satisfactorily.  Since you've asked, let me attempt an answer.  I'll call on
Ian to correct any erroneous connections that I may make with the merged
ontology (given below as a term with an initial capital).

AP2&gt;	A book is a physical object with a lifetime - subclass of
VariableObject
AP2&gt;	A book is related to the "conceptual work" which is the information
content of the text in the book.
AP2&gt;	A conceptual work is a ContentBearingObject (it may more
specifically be a Sign).
AP2&gt;	A conceptual work has temporal extent, at least one author, and no
physical extent.
AP2&gt;	A particular coding of the conceptual work is also a Sign.
AP2&gt;	A book contains a particular coding of the conceptual work.

GH&gt;	The 2nd version of "book" could be inflected to "bookcc", as an
indicative example, where the suffix "-cc". indicates the conceptual
content. I realise this inflection may not turn out to be sufficiently
robust for our requirements, but I hope you can appreciate the approach I am
suggesting. Naturally such an inflection system requires rules about
hierarchies for combinations, etc., so they take a bit of thought to do
well. 


AP&gt;&gt;	how about some basic graph theory with application to roads or
computer networks; how about an ontology of human obligations;  an ontology
of speech acts;  an ontology of textures and coverings;  an ontology of
materials;  an ontology transfers of possession.  The number and richness of
available areas is astonishing.

PH&gt;	"All human life is there", I think is the quote you want.

AP&gt;&gt;	For academics and industrial researchers there are a wealth of
possible papers to write on these topics.
&gt;
PH&gt;	This raises an interesting question, in fact: where CAN one publish
papers on ontological content?

AP2&gt;	The IJCAI SUO workshop naturally :-).  Also FOIS-2001, and KR-2002.
The Banff KA conference and AAAI would be possible although not every good
ontology paper would get accepted in those forums I suspect.  Casati and
Varzi's "Holes" book is published my MIT press so they're certainly open to
publishing books on ontologies.

GH&gt;	I would have also though that on the SUO website would also be a
potential location, but perhaps not with a large readership yet.
