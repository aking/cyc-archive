Chris,

I suspect, listening to this exchange, that the problem is that you and
Matthew (and I) come from different domains - with different interests.

So, for example, you wrote:
&gt; &gt; Suppose one wants to develop an ontology that embodies a conception
&gt; &gt; of time on which the future is not determinate, and hence on which
&gt; &gt; there are past and present objects, but no determinate future
&gt; &gt; objects.  (Such a conception might be useful, say, in a
&gt; &gt; manufacturing system that has to calculate on the fly the number of
&gt; &gt; kind of objects it is going to produce during any given run
&gt; &gt; depending on demand.)  On such a conception, the class of humans
&gt; &gt; grows moment by moment with each birth (or conception, or whatever
&gt; &gt; your criterion is for being human).


Within your community it may seem sensible to produce an axiomatisation that
is a 'language' that can and will be used to characterize several
conceptualizations - often of the same domain. To use your example, in
manufacturing, you could end up with two or more conceptualizations, of
'human' each with a different intended interpretation function for the
'objects' you have introduced here. In other words, you are axiomitising a
range of possible interpretations.

At the risk of re-opening an old debate - I presume that this means this
version of KIF is intended to support multiple ontologies - not just a
monolithic standard.

However in the business community, where we deal with the 'real' commercial
problems :), it seems to me that the problem we face when trying to get
inter-operability is to try and find a 'standard' ontology for a domain -
one where we can agree consistently on a single interpretation. So
deliberately allowing for different interpretations goes against the grain -
it seems like deliberately choosing to be equivocal.

Maybe it would be useful to distinguish between 'theories' that have a
single intended interpretation and those that, deliberately, have a range of
possible intended interpretations. It may also be useful to explore the
possible ranges of intended interpretation.

It seems to me that one important question is whether the cost of including
this kind of 'flexibility' in KIF is that is implicitly prefers some of the
range of possible full blown ontologies that can be described. And I do not
have an answer.

This suggests that the middle-out analysis suggested by Mike Uschold and
Martin King has some benefits. It provides some 'empirical' evidence of what
structures are useful - then we can make sure that the 'top' level supports
them.

However, as others have said, this is not to disparage in any way the effort
you and Pat have been making to date.

Regards
Chris

Hello Matthew, thanks again for your comments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I feel rather like someone who has just been given the answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; (which we all know is 42) but not the question.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you have the same feeling about every other proposed ontology?  If
&gt; &gt; not, why not?
&gt;
&gt; MW: Well not what we are about to produce as ISO15926-2. This will be
&gt; essentially the EPISTLE Core Model V4.0, with a variation of "some
&gt; notes on the nature of things" tacked on the front. The EPISTLE Core
&gt; Model gives the reference version (similar to your ontology) whilst
&gt; the introductory material explains what we were trying to achieve and
&gt; about some key choices we made and why, and a little about how it can
&gt; be used.

Fair enough.  It is good to provide lots of introductory material to
supplement axioms.  But this was a posting of an evolving, working
ontology to a *discussion list*.  Moreover, the front matter to the
document I sent out along with all the documentation statements go at
least some some distance toward providing introductory material.  I
suspect people differ greatly as to how much of this they like/need.
From what I see of the Core Model, however, it seems to me that you
might be guilty of the opposite error:  Lots of background, explanation,
and examples, but not much in the way of axiomatic content beyond a
simple inheritance hierarchy.  For example, it might be all well and
good in principle to tell us that "a &lt;class&gt; is a &lt;thing&gt; that is an
understanding of the nature of things".  However, I think this sort of
thing hinders more than it helps -- a class is an *understanding*?  Just
what sort of thing is an understanding?  I don't mean to be bashing
the work here (though it certainly can use some tightening-up).  The
point is that I'd much rather just see just your theory of classes and a
semantics for your language than to try to slog my way through a bunch
of natural language explanations like that one.

&gt; &gt; Not sure what you're asking for, Matthew.  The notions of class,
&gt; &gt; relation, number, and sequence are fundamental to ontology.
&gt; &gt; If they are
&gt; &gt; to be useful, they have to be axiomatized.  Here are some axioms for
&gt; &gt; review -- use them, criticize them, refine them, etc.  Isn't that just
&gt; &gt; what we do in ontology?  What more are you looking for?
&gt;
&gt; MW: I'm looking for
&gt;  - A scope statement (what you have included and what you have
&gt;  excluded).

What do you mean by "included" and "excluded"?  Does a concept count as
included if you have an axiom that refers to it?  Is a concept excluded
if you don't axiomatize it?  But what if it is compatible with one's
axioms to add an axiom for it?  "Exclusion" is too strong for that.  Do
you have a theory of inclusion and exclusion?

By my lights, rather than asking ill-defined questions about inclusion
and exclusion, ask what terms are axiomatized, ask for the axioms, and
read the documentation.  It is clearly stated, in this case, that the
ontology axiomatizes classes, relations, integers and sequences and
necessary ancillary concepts.  I'm really not sure what else you want.

&gt; This would have saved some of the questions I have asked below - and
&gt; others asking them.

Ok, maybe it'll help when I read your questions below more carefully.
(Added later: it didn't help.)

&gt;  - A little something about rationale, approach and choices, e.g. why
&gt;  did you introduce @arg,

You mean, why did I introduce row variables?  Well, there's four
paragraphs on row variables there, including an explicit semantics for
them, but the simple answer is that they give KIF a great deal of
additional expressive power (noted at various points in the
documentation statements).

&gt; what choices did you reject and why?

I really don't understand the question.  Do you mean I should have tried
to consider other kinds of variables besides row variables?  Why is it
not enough just to provide justification the apparatus I use?  Why
should I consider the apparatus I didn't use (unless there is some
widely used option that is explicitly rejected, perhaps)?

&gt; Why did you stop short of extensional classes?

Because people often talk about classes in a way that does not
presuppose extensionality.  Seems to me to be a good methodological
principle not to force a relatively simple issue when you don't have to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. You start by saying that instance-of is not required, and then in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the set theory bit go on to use it.  Is this habit?  Or are
&gt; &gt; we to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; two ways to denote classification?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A lot of folks like to use "instance-of".  It's there if you want it,
&gt; &gt; but it's dispensable.
&gt;
&gt; MW: OK. It would be worth saying this explicitly though (see above).

Sure, sure, in a complete document.  But, again, this is a discussion
group, not a journal.  It seems to me to me to be good to get relatively
stable documents out for comment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm afraid this does not compute with me. I was also not aware of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; demand for this (whose requirement is this? what are the benefits?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Suppose one wants to develop an ontology that embodies a conception
&gt; &gt; of time on which the future is not determinate, and hence on which
&gt; &gt; there are past and present objects, but no determinate future
&gt; &gt; objects.  (Such a conception might be useful, say, in a
&gt; &gt; manufacturing system that has to calculate on the fly the number of
&gt; &gt; kind of objects it is going to produce during any given run
&gt; &gt; depending on demand.)  On such a conception, the class of humans
&gt; &gt; grows moment by moment with each birth (or conception, or whatever
&gt; &gt; your criterion is for being human).  But if classes are extensional,
&gt; &gt; they don't "grow"; `human' picks out a different class with each
&gt; &gt; birth.  Now, maybe that's ok with you; maybe it's the way it should
&gt; &gt; be.  But there are, it seems to me, intuitions that warrant saying
&gt; &gt; that membership in the class of humans can change over time.
&gt; &gt; Extensionality is omitted simply to for allow such a conception of
&gt; &gt; class.  Add extensionality if you don't like it.
&gt;
&gt; MW: OK - of course one of the benefits of a 4D approach is that all this
&gt; comes out in the wash, so extensional classes don't have a problem.

At the cost of loss of generality.  Your 4D approach forces a conception
of time on which one has to view the future as determinate.  That's
exactly the kind of decision I don't think should be forced on users in
an ontology meant for general use, and I suspect that is likely to be
problematic in certain contexts.  Furthermore, your 4D approach doesn't
allow for the possibility that there could have been other things --
other humans, say -- than the ones that actually exist at some time or
other, since, by definition, the class HUMAN comprises just the actual
humans.  So if you ever need to add modality, your 4D extensional
classes are once again likely to be problematic.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If classes are non-extensional then I presume membership can also
&gt; &gt; &gt; change over time.  There needs to be something that explains how you
&gt; &gt; &gt; get to the membership at some point in time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure I understand the question, but it's irrelevant until
&gt; &gt; you add a temporality to the axioms somehow, either by introducing
&gt; &gt; temporal operators and an appropriate extension to the semantics or
&gt; &gt; an explicit theory of time.  If you do, then presumably you'd have
&gt; &gt; to add something like a temporal parameter to all predicates,
&gt; &gt; including instance-of, so that talks instead of being an instance-of
&gt; &gt; class C *at some time* t.  Is that what you're talking about?
&gt;
&gt; MW: OK so temporality is out of scope for this piece of ontology (see
&gt; above).

What is the point of this hand-holding?  Why is it too much for you to
*look* at the axioms and *see* that there are no temporal operators and
that there is no theory of time, and hence that temporality is "out of
scope"?

&gt; On the other hand you needed to invoke temporality above to justify
&gt; non-extensional classes, so perhaps it should be in scope.

You are confusing the fact that classes are not asserted to be
extensional with the proposition that they are asserted not to be
extensional once again.  Extensionality is not required in order to
allow the ontology to be extended in either direction.

&gt; &gt; &gt; (please don't expect me to decifer the KIF).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Whatever.  Though I don't understand why you wouldn't *want*
&gt; &gt; to be able to read it.
&gt;
&gt; MW: I keep struggling with it, but I know from experience with data
&gt; models that languages like this are often missread by non-experts such
&gt; as myself.  Also the introducion of (to me) new elements like @args
&gt; means I have a new struggle to come to terms with what they mean and
&gt; how they can be used.

I devote a fair amount of informal discussion to the semantics of row
variables, and state their formal semantics explicitly.  How they are
used is illustrated throughout the document.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 8. You have used the word sequence in a restrictive sense. There are
&gt; &gt; &gt; other sorts of sequence than number sequence. I suggest changing
&gt; &gt; &gt; sequence to number-sequence.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sequences are *functions* on numbers, but the numbers simply index the
&gt; &gt; elements of the sequence; they are what provide a notion of order.  To
&gt; &gt; be an element of a sequence s is to be the value of s on some positive
&gt; &gt; integer n.  But *anything* can be an element of a sequence.
&gt; &gt; This is the standard way of understanding sequences in set theory,
&gt; &gt; and it is quite elegant, so I nicked it.
&gt;
&gt; MW: But there are sequences of activities as well, and I don't think
&gt; that is the same as set theory sequences since they aren't numbers.

You seem not to have believed me when I said that anything can be an
element of a sequence.  A sequence is an ordered n-tuple of things --
*any* things, including activities.  If that's not how you want to
understand what a sequence of activities is, then all you are doing is
quibbling over the word "sequence".  The word is widely used in logic
and mathematics to mean the sort of thing I have axiomatized.  If that
does not do as a representation of a sequence of activities, then one of
us has to use a different word.  (And you have to provide us with a
theory of activity sequences, not a bunch of English and a node in an
inheritance hierarchy.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; 10. I don't understand the last theorem about nth domain.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is a special case of the general axiom for nth-domain that
&gt; &gt; corresponds to its usual manifestation as a 3-place relation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't read all the stuff on arithmetic. I'll try to read that
&gt; &gt; &gt; later.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just a simple integer arithmetic for addition and subtraction.
&gt; &gt; That's all that's needed for the rest of the ontology.
&gt;
&gt; MW: OK, so its purpose was to provide the necessary basis for the rest
&gt; of the ontology. Useful information for the requirements/scope etc
&gt; piece I was asking for.

Again, that is obvious if one studies the ontology, though I admit that
it is useful to make such things explicit in introductory material -- in
an advanced working document, once again, not a post to a discussion
group.
