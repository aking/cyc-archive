JA = Jon Awbrey
JS = John Sowa

JS: There is much more to knowledge representation than just FOL.
    FOL is a prerequisite to any and every full-bodied knowledge
    representation.   It is necessary, but not sufficient.
    But nonetheless, it is necessary.

It is not necesary to buy the &quot;philosophy of logic&quot; (POL) that is currently
packaged with FOL as though indiscernible from it, and it is not necessary
to stick oneself with the traditional syntax as if it makes no difference
to both human conceptual clarity and machine computational efficiency.
It has disserved students and society for a hundred years now to keep
selling them a degraded concrete syntax that renders them incapable
of tackling any significant problem that logic might be called on
to help with, all the while vaunting themselves to such heights
of delusion in their imaginary powers to &quot;express&quot;, after the
fact, the things that others have had to sweat it out to
discover by almost any other means possible.  The only
kind of necessary condition that you are talking about
here is the necessary end of an insufficient means.

JA: Logic today is in a horrible mess -- it is dissociated from all of
    the real action in mathematics, programming, and science generally,
    and it is not fair to blame Peirce for the state that has resulted.

JS: I agree.  The person I consider the most to blame for the sorry state
    of logic today is Bertrand Russell.  But that does not contradict the
    point I stated in paragraph #1 of this note.

Whitehead was pretty much a hapless tag-along, but Wittgenstein had a bigger hand
in the deal than I ever suspected.  In 1913, Russell was actually on the point of
trying to deal with a number of significant issues, like what it means to believe
a proposition, when LW's lambasting devastated him personally and discouraged him
from continuing in that direction, never mind that he would have been lightyears
ahead to read Peirce's work on the topic, at least he was trying to break out of
Flatopia.

JA: What we have, in the common logical formalisms that are taught in the textbooks,
    amounts to what little Russell &amp; Whitehead &amp; Wittgenstein were able to comprehend
    of the work of Boole, DeMorgan, and Peirce that managed to filter through the
    accounts of Peano &amp; Schröder.

JS: I would also add that the teaching of logic in most universities
    today is far more debased than in the 13th and 14th centuries.
    It has even gone down significantly since the watered-down versions
    of Peter of Spain's textbook were published in the 19th century.

JS: I have tried to remedy that problem in my books and papers.
    But that does not contradict paragraph #1.

Nor does it address my exceptions to it.  As long as you contribute to the impression
that &quot;It's all the same FOL&quot; in whatever syntax happens to strike the individaul fancy,
you are not helping to point out the critical differences in POL that prevent logic as
it is posed today from reconnecting with inquiry in the sciences, the humanities, and
in everyday problem-solving.

JA: Very little of the basic insight of the relation of logic to
    inquiry that Peirce had in 1870, much less what he embodied
    in his Systems of Logical Graphs, is left in what passes
    for FOL today.

JS: What passes for FOL today is what Frege dimly saw in the
    19th century and what Peirce understood far more deeply.
    But nonetheless that doesn't contradict paragraph #1.

The object of Peirce's conception is a different object than the
object of Frege's conception.  It is not just the same logic seen
more or less dimly.  Nor can you simply tack a Fregean semantics
on a fragment of Peirce's logic and end up with a workable whole.
Peirce's logic is an integral component of his semiotic, and only
makes sense within that context, which is not Tarski's contexts.

JA: You know this.  I accept that political compromises are necessary,
    though I've never developed any art in them myself, but sometimes
    you just gotta tell it like it is, no matter what.  Peirce's logic
    is not just another notation for FOL, as we know it.

JS: Of course not.  It is the foundation for a much richer system,
    but the content of that representation can be filtered through
    other notations, such as KIF and XML, and be reconstituted at
    the other end by systems that add the life-giving elixir.

No, it cannot pass that way, nor be reconstituted again.
A hundred years of wasted time and effort have shown it.
There is no choice but going back to the viable sources,
of which Peirce provides us with just one of several.

JS: Bottom line:  If we don't provide FOL plus contexts plus metalevels
    (as the CL standard is designed to do), we are going to be stuck
    with kludges built on top of RDF and XML for another 50 years.

Better the kludge you know, eh?
