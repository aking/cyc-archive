JS = John Sowa
PC = Patrick Cassidy

Pat,

I will address this over on the Ontology Sublist,
as there are getting to be too many important issues
to cover in one-per-day.  I tried saving them all up
until the end of the day for a composite response,
but that has been giving me headaches ...

PC: Concerning the differences in theories mathematical and physical:

PC: The way I am using &quot;theory&quot; is in the sense of an ontological theory,
    which is a &quot;theory of the real world&quot; -- one which addresses the
    question of which formally expressed concepts and relations best
    represent the objects and processes of the real world for the
    purpose of automated reasoning.

PC: This definition specifically excludes mathematical
    theories which do not purport to represent objects
    or events on the real world.

I spent all week drafting different answers to this remark,
as I sense that it marks one of the biggest gulfs that will
have to be crossed in making a systematic ontology work.

Right now, I feel that there is a general misunderstanding about the
way that mathematical objects are related to other sorts of objects,
and why it it useful to construe them as being related that way.

We are not going to be able to solve our problems by
putting all the mathematical objects in one pile,
all the real objects in another pile, and never
again thinking about their relationship.

In a very real way, the mathematical objects are just a collection of mental pegs
that turn out to be tantamount to a practical necessity in organizing our dealings
with real phenomena and real problems.  Despite what people may like to pretend
at different times, a glance at the history of these ideas shows that all of
them developed out of real human experience and thus refer back to it.
They are imaginary, intermediate, transitional objects that we use
as pivots or as fulcrums to apply past experience to future tasks.

JS: Irrelevant.  Your definition merely expresses your intentions,
    but there is nothing in the axioms and definitions that can in
    any distinguish terms that refer to the real world from those
    that are purely mathematical.

PC: It's true that nothing in the symbols themselves
    distinguishes a mathematical theory from a physical
    theory -- from the viewpoint of a theorem prover.  But
    if we have both mathematical theories (no  reference to
    the real world) and physical theories (intended to describe
    the real world), if both are logically self-consistent, nothing
    can prove the mathematical theory wrong but the physical theory
    can be proven wrong because the computer can interact with the
    real world it is intended to model.  This is a difference which
    I believe is well worth recognizing.

The difference that you recognize here is an &quot;interpretive&quot; distinction,
having to do with the way that a particular agent chooses or tries to
apply the theory at a particular moment.  It is not an &quot;essential&quot;
distinction, that is, a feature that resides in the theory itself.
It's really that way with any kind of story or text.  You can go
to a play and just take it as a thing in itself, or you can see
something in it that constitutes a lesson in real life.
It's a matter for your interpretation.

JS: But we must distinguish form (its syntax) and content (what it is
    talking about in the real world).  From the computer's point of view,
    it's all mathematical, and the computer can't tell what the terms refer to.

PC: This isn't completely true, because the computers aren't totally
    deaf, dumb, and blind.  They have inputs and outputs which depend
    on objects in the real world.  If we have a theory of the (complete)
    syntax of a natural language, and a disk file is asserted to be an
    instance of a sample of that language, the failure of a sentence in
    that file to conform to the syntax proves that the language theory
    is not true for all sentences of the language.  There are other
    possible inputs.  A simple light sensor and an assertion that
    the time of day can be found at the NIST clock site can prove
    or disprove the assertion that the sky is considerably brighter
    at noon than at midnight (on average).  A robot with mechanical
    movement and touch sensors can test a wide variety of physical
    theories, many of which may be perfectly mathematically
    consistent but wrong in describing the physical world.

All of these things are also true of biological beings.
It is one of the reasons that Peirce kept emphasizing
that sense data are just one species of signs and that
motor acts are just one species of interpretant signs.

Thus, when you relate sense data and motor acts to conceptual signs,
you are only &quot;mediately&quot; relating the real world to several different
languages, the languages of sense data, concepts, and actions.  That
brand of realistic semantics is what pragmatic thinking is all about.

PC: But my focus has been on ways to create a lattice
    of physical theories that isolates and minimizes the
    differences between the theories.  Then the essential
    distinguishing points of each theory can be summarized
    more succinctly so as to provide an index that will help
    users find the theories that they want.  I think this would
    assist in forming the kind of  module metadata hierarchy that
    Leo was suggesting.  The point I was trying to make in discussing
    real-world instances is that the most likely source of contradiction
    between theories comes when two theories have the same real-world object
    as instances of contradictory assertions.  Without the common real-world
    objects, the theories might appear mathematically consistent (e.g. if
    they have different internal labels for the real-world object).
    This point has no mathematical significance, but I believed
    that it could help in focusing on how we might try to
    recognize and minimize differences between theories
    so as to maximize their interoperability.

I am not sure what you mean by &quot;physical theories&quot; here.
All the best physical theories of the world today are
expressed as mathematical theories -- the business
of testing them is a matter of making predications
about what sorts of data (dots on film, pixels on
crt's, and old fashioned sorts of pointer readings)
will be most prevalent under specified experimental
arrangements) -- it's signs all the way down, so far
as given to us.

If you mean commonsense theories of the world, then it's all the same --
the point is that you never have direct access to the object, only
more signs of it, all which have to be reconciled with each other.

Jon Awbrey

JS: Bottom line:  The lattice of all possible theories will include all
    those that are true of the real world and all those that aren't.
    Distinguishing one from the other is a job for science and
    engineering.  It can't be done by the computer by itself.

PC: Do we really want a lattice of all possible theories,
    or just those reasonable enough to be possibly useful?
    and preferably testable?

PC: One thing I am still not certain of -- do you prefer
    to have an explicit subsumption lattice of theories,
    or is this something that you feel can be derived
    from a more general representation of the lattice?
