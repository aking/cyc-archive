Matthew Jon and others,

MW: However, you have frequently suggested that the only sort of document
that you find acceptable is something that purports to be a standard
ontology, which doesn't leave those of us that think there are some
pre-requisites anywhere much to go.

JS:   Agreed.  My use of the term &quot;standards words&quot; is too narrow.  In your
other post you gave some examples of pre-standards words:

- statement of requirements
 - standing documents for internal procedures
 - documents providing background theory/approach taken/proposed
   for the development of a standard.

	I agree these are all valid for documents, but not for extended
threads.  We must balance volume with how directly it contributes.  Jon's
postings are too remote for his volume.  He could post papers or introduce
threads, but he should not continue the threads on this list.  


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: I see Jon's contributions as towards a future, rather than 
&gt; &gt; current
&gt; &gt; document.
&gt; 
&gt; If this were true, he could surely show 'some' early words.  

MW: He has shown lots of early words. The whole Functional Logic thread
is early words.

JS: OK, let's take this as an example.  Let me ask some questions (keeping
in mind I don't follow Jon's threads). 
	1. He should have started out by proposing a draft of those words,
or writing a paper and asking for review.  I'm guessing he started the
thread and did his ongoing exploration.
	2. Did he wrap up his final version and present it for review and
acceptance?
	3. Does it relate to either starter document?  If so, did he
formally propose it to them and explain how it fits?  If not, please explain
its contribution.  


&gt; 
&gt; JS:  He is welcome to do his exploring on the Ontology list, but it
&gt; doesn't belong on the SUO list.  If we met in person, he wouldn't be
&gt; permitted to do about a quarter of the talking on these types 
&gt; of topics.

MW: This is why I suggested essentially renaming the ontolgy list to
the development list.

JS: Jon, would you agree to do your work on a 'development' list if we
created done?
