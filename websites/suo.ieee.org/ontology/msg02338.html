Dear Jon,

&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; It has begun to occur to me over the last few days that
&gt; the difference between our prespectives -- "prespective"?
&gt; hmm, that was a genuine typo, but prehaps it will turn out
&gt; to have a meaning that is telling in the present application --
&gt; arises more than anything else from divergent ways of seeing
&gt; the use of "formal or logical or mathematical" (FOLOM) models.
&gt; I am going to think about this a little more and maybe try to
&gt; write out a separate comment about it, but it takes us back to
&gt; a couple of pictures that we have seen here before, to a whole
&gt; array of issues that I myself have been thinking about for quite
&gt; some time, and over all to a problematic that is rather ancient --
&gt; Immanuel Kant's use of what he called "schemata" as intermediate
&gt; representations between realities and the mind is the first thing
&gt; that comes to mind, but I am sure that the topic goes back further
&gt; than that -- anyway, here are links to a few of the occasions that
&gt; I can find on which we broached this subject locally and recently:

&gt; As I tried to follow this thread, it turned out to be
&gt; a lot more tangled than I thought, going in, it would be.
&gt; Since the fine old philosophical concept of "reification"
&gt; seems to be yet another one of those ideas that will soon
&gt; be rendered meaningless by the cargo cultists of the world,

MW: I don't understand this remark.

&gt; if not by the flushed enthusiasts of the WW-WC, 

MW: WW-WC is??

&gt; if you catch
&gt; my drift, I have tossed in a number of classical references
&gt; to the vast and now distant ocean of good sense, of which
&gt; our own humankind was long ago the master on this score,
&gt; to wit, the associated ideas of abstraction and analogy
&gt; that go into our once-evolved crafts of hypostasis and
&gt; modeling, in other words, reification and simulation,
&gt; as I knew them, once, to be in their glory days --
&gt; alas! those days are now gone and quite forgotten.
&gt; But I nostalgicize ...
&gt; 
&gt; More specific remarks interspersed below,

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've read ahead a number of messages,
&gt; &gt; and this is a summary of where I am
&gt; &gt; at present.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In what you say below it seems that you are using
&gt; &gt; a different definition of what a relation and tuple
&gt; &gt; is to me (at least).
&gt; 
&gt; I have been suspecting this for quite some time now, but
&gt; you have insisted on repeating the standard definition of
&gt; a relation as a set of tuples, even though you rarely ever
&gt; use this defintion when it comes down to cases.

MW: This is not what I meant. I may make mistakes sometimes
(sloppiness) but I really do mean a relation is set of tuples.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; To you it seems that any construct ...
&gt; 
&gt; I think that we may have to pause at this point and discuss
&gt; what is meant by "construct", no doubt as used within various
&gt; dialects, and if we fail to find a common meaning then we may
&gt; need to look for a way to disptch the word without portfolio.

MW: (data) Construct, an assemblage used to represent something,
e.g. a relation, a tuple, a constant, a variable, a set, 
a predicate.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; To you it seems that any construct
&gt; &gt; that has to involve at least three
&gt; &gt; things to be valid is necessarily
&gt; &gt; a 3-adic relation.
&gt; 
&gt; I try to take you at your word, but I honestly never know for sure
&gt; when you are using the word "relation" to mean "relation" and when
&gt; you are using the word "relation" to mean "relation instance", as
&gt; seems to be required to make sense of what you go on to predicate.
&gt; 
&gt; If I try to read this straightforwardly,
&gt; I must amend it to read a bit like this:
&gt; 
&gt; | To you it seems that any construct
&gt; | that has to involve at least three
&gt; | things to be valid is necessarily
&gt; | [a (&gt;= 3)-adic relation instance].
&gt; 
&gt; Can you clarify for me what you mean in this instance?

I was thinking at the set level, like Chris M's signature, e.g.
  gives involves a giver, a receiver, and a given.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to continue without going totally bats,
&gt; I will have to substitute in your text below,
&gt; in square brackets, the changes that I need
&gt; to make sense of what you say.  Please let
&gt; me know if these are not agreeable to you.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem with this is that a 3-adic relation [instance]
&gt; &gt; requires EXACTLY 3 components, not at least 3 components,
&gt; &gt; and that these three components are necessary for identity.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not know what the last clause, about identity, means here.

MW: That without all 3 elements, in this representation form, 
you cannot identify the object uniquely.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Relatively few things [relation instances?] in real life meet
&gt; &gt; the criterion of exactly 3 components, and though I agree that
&gt; &gt; the example you have used of logical operators is one of them,
&gt; &gt; activities [activity instances?] 

MW: My sloppiness, I should have said activity classes.

&gt; generally are not.
&gt; 
&gt; You must try to remember whose team you are on --
&gt; it is not my fault that you keep throwing me all
&gt; of these interceptions!  My team is the one that
&gt; keeps on saying that there are things in reality,
&gt; the activities of communicating, giving, learning,
&gt; and thinking, just to name a few, whose inherent
&gt; complexities -- the full measure of which no doubt
&gt; goes beyond our meagre mortal abilities to render
&gt; effable, effectively describabel, f-able, or even
&gt; formalizable at all -- are such that they require
&gt; relational models whose arity is at least three
&gt; in order to represent them with anything like
&gt; the requisite adequacy.  

MW: Actually I am arguing that many 3-adic relations (or
higher) are inadequate for modelling these situations
adequately. This is because 3+adic relations imply
constraints that are just no true of the wolrd in many
cases, particularly in the cases of the examples given
above. I am also arguing that even for those where a
3-adic relation is valid, as in your logic example, it
is possible to replace it with a set of binary relations
that convey the same information.

&gt; Your team is the one
&gt; that keeps on saying that it just ain't so,
&gt; that anything that can be talked to death
&gt; can be talked to death, without loss of
&gt; adequate descriptive power, solely in
&gt; the reduced medium of 2-adic relations.
&gt; Every now and then, you appear to want
&gt; to switch sides, and yet without having
&gt; your move be counted a foul of the game
&gt; in play, as if to say that references to
&gt; realities more complex than 3-adic should
&gt; count on the side of 2-adic reductionists.
&gt; I do not understand this sort of thinking.

MW: Perhaps because I (my team) is trying to discover
the truth rather than argue a point. Further, I assume
that there is something in what you say, and I would
prefer to understand what it is, rather than just dismiss
it because I don't understand.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, even with logical operators it is possible
&gt; &gt; to represent these without using 3-adic relations, ...
&gt; 
&gt; No, it is not.

MW: T'is so :-o) (sticks tongue out)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; although I agree that this does not remove
&gt; &gt; the three-ness of what is represented.
&gt; 
&gt; ???

MW: I am quite happy that in a "giving" that ontologically
there are necessarily at least 3 things involved, at least
one giver, at least one given and at least one receiver.
However, I do not agree that there is at most one giver,
at most one receiver and at most one given, and this is what
is implied by a 3-adic relation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have demonstrated this.
&gt; 
&gt; No, you have not.

MW: Then you have to explain what is wrong (and don't give
me stuff about (and a b c d) since this can easily be
replaced, and is strictly not necessary anyway, since the
simple set of relations - since they are enumerated - 
is all that is required.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You claim (elsewhere) that I have only presented tuples,
&gt; &gt; but in fact I have presented fully enumerated relations.
&gt; 
&gt; And by this "enumerated" to say that you changed the subject from
&gt; a 3-adic relation to a 4-adic relation.  "Changing the subject"
&gt; appears to be the solecism of choice in regard to this matter.

MW: What do you mean here by "changed the subject"?

MW: My interpretation is "changed the identifier". In your
3-adic relation, all 3 elements are needed in order to identify
any particular row. I have started by adding a "row id" which
alone is capable of representing the same object. This is quite
a legitimate move, even when it isn't necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Finally, there is still the issue of your claim that things
&gt; &gt; can be reduced to triads.  You have however singularly failed
&gt; &gt; to provide the solution to this for the measurement example I
&gt; &gt; presented for those who think this can always be done without
&gt; &gt; violating the constraints that you wish to impose on others as
&gt; &gt; to what adacity is.

MW: I note the continued failure to respond to this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm going to write two brief papers:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1.  The transformation of a ternary relation into
&gt; &gt;     some set of binary relations (and vice versa)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2.  The use of relations to represent the world about us,
&gt; &gt;     practice and limitations.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; These should at least put in one place where I stand currently.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt;    Matthew

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, I think what you *really* want is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the purely generalized form of this axiom,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of which the above is just an instance:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (forall (?x ?y ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (gives ?x ?y ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;              (exists (?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                   (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (giver ?e' ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (receiver ?e' ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (given ?e' ?z))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                       (= ?e ?e')))))))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I think we're getting there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But even more is needed after the "&lt;=&gt;" to assure that:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The same giving does not have more than one giver.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The same giving does not have more than one given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) The same giving does not have more than one receiver.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  This actually gets to the heart of the issue quite nicely,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      and provides one of the reasons I am unhappy with more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      than binary relations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  You are right that the ternary relation does not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      only say that a giving relation involves at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      a giver a receiver and a gift, but that it involves
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      exactly one giver, receiver, and gift.  I think others
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      have pointed out that this is not necessarily the case
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      for all givings.  There may be many givers, many receivers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      or many gifts.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  This is what has driven us away from triadic or higher
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      relations, rather than anything else.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  So I will now argue that the form that we have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      ended up with for giving is actually a more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      acurate reflection of reality.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I'm not quite up to writing what I want in KIF,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  with certainty.  Perhaps someone will step in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  and add the gory detail.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The &lt;=&gt; axiom above is invalid and probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    could be used to prove a contradiction.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) An augmented &lt;=&gt; axiom like the one above but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    disallowing two receivers, etc., might not lead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     to contradictions and a generalization of it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     might be OK in the SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) I certainly would not personally want to call
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    the change from what precedes the &lt;=&gt; to what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    follows the &lt;=&gt; a "reduction".
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Indeed, the only thing that is reduced is the arity
&gt; &gt; &gt;        of the relations used.  On the other hand we do have
&gt; &gt; &gt;        a more accurate model.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;                   ^^^
&gt; &gt; &gt; False statement.  |||
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Because I still believe that you really want to know.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Exercise for the reader:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the arity of the first "and" relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is invoked in the above bit of kiffage?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hint:  It has 5 arguments, and therefore represents
&gt; &gt; &gt;        a map 'And&lt;5&gt;' such that 'And&lt;5&gt;' : B^5 -&gt; B.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The use of a single symbol, in the way that "and" is used above,
&gt; &gt; &gt; to denote a series of operations 'And&lt;j&gt;', for j = 1, 2, 3, ...,
&gt; &gt; &gt; tantamount to an indefinite degree of equivocation, constitutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; what is commonly known as a "multigrade operator".  They can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; very convenient bits of syntactic sugar, but they do not alter
&gt; &gt; &gt; the underlying logical complexity of the operations invoked.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is, of course, aside from the fact that the relation "giving"
&gt; &gt; &gt; is at least as complex as a 3-adic relation, since its argument is
&gt; &gt; &gt; at least a 3-tuple -- and you can tell that it's at least 
&gt; a 3-tuple
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the fact that it has at least 3 components.  That's all that
&gt; &gt; &gt; a 3-tuple is.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The basic principle here is:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; | If it looks like a k-tuple,
&gt; &gt; &gt; | if it talks like a k-tuple,
&gt; &gt; &gt; | if it walks like a k-tuple,
&gt; &gt; &gt; | then abduce it's a k-tuple.
