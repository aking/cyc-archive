Dear Matthew,

Please see responses below--

Regards,

Phil

&gt; MW: If I compare EXIST and KIF I think they are functionally
&gt; fairly similar.
&gt; EXIST is designed with a processing model in mind, whereas KIF is designed
&gt; for exchange. I also think that EXIST is easier to read than KIF. This was
&gt; the main reason for rejecting KIF when we started to develop
&gt; EXIST. However,
&gt; I am aware that EXIST could be improved too from this point of view.

PJ: I think that "understandability" should be a criterion in selecting a
language, though it is subjective...People tend to like what they've
developed or already learned...

PJ: This reminds me of the issue that is often discussed regarding the ease
of understandability and expressiveness of predicate calculus vs. natural
language -- In particular, John Sowa has written about this issue in
comparing predicate calculus vs. conceptual graphs... It seems possible that
the same kinds of arguments might translate to KIF (with the same kinds of
rebuttals)...(?) This may be a way to address the understandability and
expressiveness question...


&gt; MW: So yes EXIST could make a good starting point for the SUO. However, I
&gt; find here an assumption that KIF is the starting point, and I have
&gt; considered it unwise for a newcomer like me to challenge this.

PJ: Hmmm....I think it is generally wise at the outset of a great endeavor
to question all assumptions...

PJ: This gets back to the issue, what are the requirements for the ontology,
and based on that, what are the requirements for the language in which the
ontology is expressed... Based on those requirements, which languages best
meet the requirements?

PJ: KIF is elegant, and a lot of thought and work has gone into it, clearly.
Yet it would not hurt to compare tools -- perhaps one or both tools may
benefit...


&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I would like to make the suggestion that the SUO group
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should consider
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leveraging EPISTLE and other models already developed in
&gt; &gt; EXPRESS as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starting point for developing SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: This is a better idea. The EPISTLE Core Model is
&gt; &gt; designed to be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; foundation that can integrate a range of ontologies (or data
&gt; &gt; &gt; models). It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not perfect, but it is the current result of some 15 years
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerted effort
&gt; &gt; &gt; by a range of people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PJ: I am glad to hear this. I hope that SUO'ers will give very serious
&gt; &gt; consideration to use of EPISTLE as a starting point.
&gt;
&gt; MW: I really think we would get there quicker if we did.

PJ: Well, this recommendation is now on the table, for the group to
consider.

[...]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EXPRESS, EPISTLE and the other models developed in
&gt; &gt; EXPRESS, have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of having been developed over several years by many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people in an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open, standards-based effort.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: One of the key things we can bring is experience of
&gt; &gt; &gt; developing standards
&gt; &gt; &gt; in this area. The SUO does not have to suffer all the
&gt; &gt; mistakes that we
&gt; &gt; &gt; managed to make.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PJ: I think this is a very important point. Any insights that you can
&gt; &gt; provide should be very helpful to the group.
&gt;
&gt; MW: Most of the objections I have been raising to our current course are
&gt; based on this experience. I know exactly where we are currently headed -
&gt; I've been there.

PJ: Can you summarize from your perspectives, what mistakes are currently
being made by SUO (or towards which SUO is headed) and what you would
recommend to address them?
