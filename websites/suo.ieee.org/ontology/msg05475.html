DATA.  Note 18

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

Let's push on with the analysis of the transformation:

F : &lt;u, v&gt; ~&gt; &lt;f&lt;u, v&gt;, g&lt;u, v&gt;&gt; = &lt;((u)(v)), ((u, v))&gt;.

For ease of comparison and computation, I will collect
the Figures that we need for the remainder of the work
together on one page.

Computation Summary for f&lt;u, v&gt; = ((u)(v))

Figure 1.1 expands f = ((u)(v)) over [u, v] to produce
the equivalent exclusive disjunction uv + u(v) + (u)v.

Figure 1.2 expands Ef = ((u + du)(v + dv)) over [u, v] to arrive at
Ef = uv (du dv) + u(v) (du (dv)) + (u)v ((du) dv) + (u)(v)((du)(dv)).

Ef tells you what you would have to do, from where you are in the
universe [u, v], if you want to end up in a place where f is true.
In this case, where the prevailing proposition f is ((u)(v)), the
indication uv (du dv) of Ef tells you this:  If u and v are both
true where you are, then just don't change both u and v, and you
will end up in a place where ((u)(v)) is true.

Figure 1.3 expands Df over [u, v] to end up with the formula:
Df = uv du dv + u(v) du(dv) + (u)v (du)dv + (u)(v)((du)(dv)).

Df tells you what you would have to do, from where you are in the
universe [u, v], if you want to bring about a change in the value
of f, that is, if you want to get to a place where the value of f
is different from what it is where you are.  In the present case,
where the reigning proposition f is ((u)(v)), the term uv du dv
of Df tells you this:  If u and v are both true where you are,
then you would have to change both u and v in order to reach
a place where the value of f is different from what it is
where you are.

Figure 1.4 approximates Df by the linear form
df = uv 0 + u(v) du + (u)v dv + (u)(v)(du, dv).

Figure 1.5 shows what remains of the difference map Df
when the first order linear contribution df is removed:
rf = uv du dv + u(v) du dv + (u)v du dv + (u)(v) du dv.
This form can be written more succinctly as rf = du dv.
