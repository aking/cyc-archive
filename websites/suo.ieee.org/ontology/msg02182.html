&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I always take people at their word,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I take you really to want to know:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The POV that you have been exposing here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information contained in their apt expressions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The "Pat Hayes Universal Change Of Variables Formula" (PHUCOVF)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that nobody ever meant to say what some people once pretended
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it said, as have you also in regard to a co-indited point.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned
&gt; &gt; &gt;      Pat's proof, but I am not sufficiently versed in these
&gt; &gt; &gt;      things to be sure that you are not employing the same kinds
&gt; &gt; &gt;      of tricks that you claim Pat has employed.  So I'm afraid that
&gt; &gt; &gt;      is not an arguement that will convince me on its own.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt;      wish to do that you will have to present a specific example
&gt; &gt; &gt;      of where the information in some triadic relation cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt;      be transformed into some set of binary relations.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt;      provide the triadic relation, I will provide the binary
&gt; &gt; &gt;      relations from which the triadic relation can be
&gt; &gt; &gt;      constructed (or not and admit you are right).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We are all learning as we go, some of us one set of
&gt; &gt; things, others another, but I think that Pat and I
&gt; &gt; have finally settled down to the purely logical --
&gt; &gt; in contradistinction to the "puerly rhetorical" (sic) --
&gt; &gt; facet of the task, and I am secure in the knowledge
&gt; &gt; that both of us are dogged enough not to let it go
&gt; &gt; until we flesh out some general satisfaction on
&gt; &gt; this particular bone of contention.  'On jugera',
&gt; &gt; as Evariste Galois said.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
&gt; &gt; I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
&gt; &gt; any rational sense will come of arguing about any puported form of
&gt; &gt; "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
&gt; &gt; "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
&gt; &gt; unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
&gt; &gt; that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
&gt; &gt; I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
&gt; &gt; since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
&gt; &gt; anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
&gt; &gt; and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
&gt; &gt; at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
&gt; &gt; has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
&gt;      In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
&gt;      number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
&gt;      network of relations there is a path that links them together.

This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
are special cases of relations, but they do not affect the
general truth that many 3-adic relations are not of this
kind.  And once again the form of this reduction involves
3-adic relations at every step of the analysis.

For example, contemplate the 3-adic relation that is expressed by
the rheme "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- and then ---",
of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt;, and which
one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:

|                        Jack
|                       o
|                      /
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
|                      \
|                       o
|                        Jill

Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.

The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
suggest by means of the following scheme:

|                        Jack
|                [LP1]--o
|                 /      \
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12] 
|                 \      /
|                [LP2]--o
|                        Jill

In this picture, the 2-adic relations L0, L1, L2 are usually
put forward as capturing forms of pairwise relationship like:

LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
                 in the ordered pair q.

LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2st component
                 in the ordered pair q.

L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
                 y is the 2nd component
                 in some ordered pair.

Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:

LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP (q, y).

This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.

And yet, once again, this entire skirmish to mop-up the residual bits
of 2-adic structure that may be squeegeed out of the original 3-adic
relation is being waged only after the general issue has been conceded,
for we had to use the 3-adic relation associated with the truth-functional
connective "and" just to express the defintion of LP12.

Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L^0 and L^1
is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.

&gt; Now the "semantics" of the linking relations should support
&gt; the derivation of something more complex, but that is all.

It should support the formal recognition of "something more complex",
namely, a 3-adic relation which is not reducible to 2-adic relations.

&gt; MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
&gt;      for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
&gt;      that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
&gt;      then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
&gt;      statement about how I see relations.

This is another one of those places where I fear that we might
be using the word "relation" in some radically divergent way,
since I would not naturally speak of a relation in general as
representing anything, since relations are primarily objects
of discussion and thought to me, and not syntactic entities.
The special brand of a relation that I call a "sign relation"
does indeed have two of its three feet in realms of signs,
and there are many types of relations that I would choose
for "modeling" objects and processes in the world, and
there are very special sorts of relational structures
in mathematics that are called "group representations",
so maybe there is a bridge ahead, but I cannot be sure.

&gt; MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
&gt;      They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
&gt;      infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
&gt;      combinations of things, and then I see a further
&gt;      infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
&gt;      ourselves to those where all the members of the
&gt;      set have the same adacity).
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of them,
&gt;      but to a very small subset we choose (note the word choose)
&gt;      to map our experiences of the world to in terms of connections
&gt;      (broad sense) that we see between things.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the world
&gt;      and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how to do it).
&gt;      I'm not sure you share that view.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I would suggest that we talked more about what was being represented
&gt;     rather than how it was being represented.  I suspect that we would
&gt;     then find more to agree about.

I am afraid that we can only talk about things in so far as we represent them.

&gt; &gt; As an object example,
&gt; &gt; taken for the moment in the converse direction of synthesis, joining
&gt; &gt; an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already an element of a 3-adic
&gt; &gt; relation, just as every other "binary operation" is a 3-adic relation.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.  Binary operations
&gt;      are of the form F : a -&gt; b, and even though a and b might be quite
&gt;      complex, the essential form is binary.

I would say that the accidental form, even the superficial form is binary --
anything at all can be glossed over with a superficially simple appearance --
it is our job precisely to detect and to reveal the underlying complexities.

&gt; &gt; Now, there are good reasons for proceeding further, that is,
&gt; &gt; once the omnipresence of 3-adic relations in every analytic
&gt; &gt; project is conceded, but perhaps it would be best for me to
&gt; &gt; halt at this point and see if we have any form of agreement
&gt; &gt; about this much, at least.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
&gt;      We are talking about representation of things, rather
&gt;      than what things are.

The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated knowledge of being,
is not a day that I think any of our sort will see this side of heaven.
The only way that we "fallible and mortal finite information creatures"
have to approach the One and the Universal is via the Many Appearances,
by taking up as many different styles and types of representations as
we can fathom, and then, by way of transformations on them, to distill
what invariants, half concealing and half disclosing, they may manifest.

&gt; If we set the representation by relations of particular adacity
&gt; aside, I think we would find much more to agree about.

Well, that is a heavenly notion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; circumstance that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from an element of one.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
&gt; &gt; &gt;      of what a relation is to me.  This would easily explain how we
&gt; &gt; &gt;      have been missing each other.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will take up the task of that refinement at my next opportunity.
