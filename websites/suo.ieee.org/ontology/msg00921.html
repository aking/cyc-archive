&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: ... I would like to make the suggestion that the SUO group
&gt; &gt; &gt; should compare the representational features of EXPRESS with
&gt; &gt; &gt; KIF, to decide
&gt; &gt; &gt; whether EXPRESS may in fact be a better starting point for
&gt; &gt; &gt; representation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUO. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each language?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Well, before anyone expends too much effort on this exercise,
&gt; &gt; perhaps I
&gt; &gt; should say that one of the reasons I am here is a 
&gt; dissatisfaction with
&gt; &gt; EXPRESS. We have already started developing a language called EXIST
&gt; &gt; (EXpression if Information based on logic and Set Theory) to
&gt; &gt; address some of
&gt; &gt; these issues. We had originally rejected KIF as being just too
&gt; &gt; difficult to
&gt; &gt; understand. EXIST is not as clear as some ACE would be, but I do
&gt; &gt; think it is
&gt; &gt; easier to understand than KIF.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: EXPRESS is an entity relationship language, which is intended
&gt; &gt; to define
&gt; &gt; data structures, rather than axioms, although it has an extensive
&gt; &gt; constraint
&gt; &gt; specification language. Overall it is a very extensive 
&gt; language, with
&gt; &gt; roughly the same capability as the static part of the UML, for those
&gt; &gt; familiar with it. This complexity is one of the issues, 
&gt; plus some of the
&gt; &gt; basic limitations of the entity relationship paradigm. When 
&gt; you want to
&gt; &gt; design a system to implement an ontology, EXPRESS is a good 
&gt; choice (so an
&gt; &gt; EXPRESS model of KIF could be useful).
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Thanks for your comments, and also those given separately by Mike
&gt; Uschold and John Velman. These responses basically satisfy my 
&gt; suggestion
&gt; that the SUO give some consideration to the use of EXPRESS, 
&gt; and advantages
&gt; and disadvantages vs. KIF. Of course, I accept your advice 
&gt; that EXPRESS
&gt; would not be suitable for SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Matthew, how far along is the EXIST language? Can you 
&gt; provide pointers
&gt; to more information about it? Do you think it might be a good 
&gt; starting point
&gt; for use in SUO?

MW: Information about EXIST can be found at:
<A  HREF="http://www.iso18876.org/pwi.html">http://www.iso18876.org/pwi.html</A>
The documentation includes:
 - Introduction (slides)
 - informal presentation of the lexical form (slides)
 - informal presentation of the graphical form (slides)
 - ebnf of the lexical form
 - an EXPRESS meta-model of EXIST (document)

MW: If I compare EXIST and KIF I think they are functionally fairly similar.
EXIST is designed with a processing model in mind, whereas KIF is designed
for exchange. I also think that EXIST is easier to read than KIF. This was
the main reason for rejecting KIF when we started to develop EXIST. However,
I am aware that EXIST could be improved too from this point of view.

MW: So yes EXIST could make a good starting point for the SUO. However, I
find here an assumption that KIF is the starting point, and I have
considered it unwise for a newcomer like me to challenge this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I would like to make the suggestion that the SUO group
&gt; &gt; &gt; should consider
&gt; &gt; &gt; leveraging EPISTLE and other models already developed in 
&gt; EXPRESS as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting point for developing SUO.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: This is a better idea. The EPISTLE Core Model is 
&gt; designed to be a
&gt; &gt; foundation that can integrate a range of ontologies (or data
&gt; &gt; models). It is
&gt; &gt; not perfect, but it is the current result of some 15 years
&gt; &gt; concerted effort
&gt; &gt; by a range of people.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: I am glad to hear this. I hope that SUO'ers will give very serious
&gt; consideration to use of EPISTLE as a starting point.

MW: I really think we would get there quicker if we did.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Many of the other models in SC4 are also useful, but in 
&gt; general more
&gt; &gt; specialised. So when you want to know how to make a 3D geometric
&gt; &gt; representation of something, or incorporate a piece part product
&gt; &gt; catalogue,
&gt; &gt; we probably have what you need.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: It is worth pointing out that the representation of 
&gt; information about
&gt; &gt; something, which seems to exercise so many people here, is 
&gt; rather well
&gt; &gt; understood and taken for granted.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me there could be some promise in both these 
&gt; efforts. For
&gt; &gt; &gt; example, you have written that the following concepts
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently listed by Pat
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hayes could probably fit into EPISTLE:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an 'information-bearing object' (see my long comment in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recent message);
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a piece of a certain kind of cloth which was used in evidence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a trial;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the color of that piece of cloth;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the act of breaking an egg by hitting it on the side of a bowl;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a style of dress used by a certain social class in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 17th-century France;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the shape of Marilyn Monroe's left ankle;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the cause of the Concorde disaster;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a dish (in the sense that Eggs Benedict is a dish, ie a 
&gt; something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that could be a menu item; as opposed to any particular 
&gt; example of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that dish, or the symbols on the menu describing it.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Yes. I still have to respond to Adam's request for how they fit.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Your response to Adam's request was recently posted, and is very
&gt; interesting. I look forward to learning more about EPISTLE.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; EXPRESS, EPISTLE and the other models developed in 
&gt; EXPRESS, have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; advantage of having been developed over several years by many
&gt; &gt; &gt; people in an
&gt; &gt; &gt; open, standards-based effort.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: One of the key things we can bring is experience of
&gt; &gt; developing standards
&gt; &gt; in this area. The SUO does not have to suffer all the 
&gt; mistakes that we
&gt; &gt; managed to make.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: I think this is a very important point. Any insights that you can
&gt; provide should be very helpful to the group.

MW: Most of the objections I have been raising to our current course are
based on this experience. I know exactly where we are currently headed -
I've been there.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My understanding is that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; are publicly
&gt; &gt; &gt; available standards, which could be leveraged by SUO. Their
&gt; &gt; &gt; development has
&gt; &gt; &gt; also been focused on practical, industry-based applications
&gt; &gt; &gt; which may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; consonant with SUO's objectives. For all of these reasons,
&gt; &gt; &gt; plus the general
&gt; &gt; &gt; expressiveness of EXPRESS, they may be better starting points
&gt; &gt; &gt; and long term
&gt; &gt; &gt; approaches than either of the current alternatives, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be: a)
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting with a relatively new "merged ontology" developed in
&gt; &gt; &gt; KIF; b) going
&gt; &gt; &gt; with CYC, if a suitable copyright release letter can be obtained.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I think the reality is that there are a number of starting
&gt; &gt; points, each
&gt; &gt; of which is valuable in its own right. What I think we need 
&gt; to do is take
&gt; &gt; some time to understand these, and see how we candraw from 
&gt; each of them in
&gt; &gt; the most appropriate way. At the least they each represent some
&gt; &gt; requirements
&gt; &gt; we need to address.
&gt; 
&gt; PJ: Again, I agree about the potential for multiple starting 
&gt; points, and
&gt; need to identify requirements. It might be a good idea for 
&gt; SUO to explore
&gt; multiple paths in parallel.

MW: Yes. If I ever get a quiet moment I will translate part of the latest
version of the EPISTLE Core Model into KIF - but I find KIF so hard to write
as well as read :-(
