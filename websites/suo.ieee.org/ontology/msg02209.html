Matthew,

Stretching this thread a little further,
carding out some of the blahs and blebs,
and ironing out not a few layers of the
many-quothèd and poly-wrinkled textures.

Jon Awbrey

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  One reason I am pursuing this discussion is that
     if there really are things it cannot handle,
     I would really like to know.

JA:  I always take people at their word,
     so I take you really to want to know:

JA:  The POV that you have been exposing here
     cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
     if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
     information contained in their apt expressions.

JA:  The "Pat Hayes All-Purpose Change Of Variables Formula" (PHAPCOVF)
     has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula that
     it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted that nobody
     ever meant to say what some people once pretended that it said, as have
     you also in regard to a co-indited point.

MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned
     Pat's proof, but I am not sufficiently versed in these
     things to be sure that you are not employing the same kinds
     of tricks that you claim Pat has employed.  So I'm afraid that
     is not an arguement that will convince me on its own.  If you
     wish to do that you will have to present a specific example
     of where the information in some triadic relation cannot
     be transformed into some set of binary relations.  If you
     provide the triadic relation, I will provide the binary
     relations from which the triadic relation can be
     constructed (or not and admit you are right).

Still waiting ...

Just to refresh your memory,
here are L^0 and L^1 once again:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
|
| Relation L^0
|
| L^0 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 0}.
|
| L^0 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
|
|    &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
|    &lt;0, 1, 1&gt;
|    &lt;1, 0, 1&gt;
|    &lt;1, 1, 0&gt;
|
---------------------------------------------------
|
| Relation L^1
|
| L^1 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 1}.
|
| L^1 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
|
|    &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;
|    &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;
|    &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;
|    &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤


JA:  We are all learning as we go, some of us one set of
     things, others another, but I think that Pat and I
     have finally settled down to the purely logical --
     in contradistinction to the "puerly rhetorical" (sic) --
     facet of the task, and I am secure in the knowledge
     that both of us are dogged enough not to let it go
     until we flesh out some general satisfaction on
     this particular bone of contention.  'On jugera',
     as Evariste Galois once said.

Still, I have been wrong about this before.

JA:  Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
     I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
     any rational sense will come of arguing about any puported form of
     "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
     "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
     unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
     that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
     I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
     since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
     anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
     and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
     at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
     has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.

MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
     In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
     number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
     network of relations there is a path that links them together.

JA:  This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
     that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
     this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
     such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
     It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
     3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
     same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
     the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
     are many such special cases of relations, but their existence
     does not affect the general truth that many 3-adic relations
     are not of this kind.  And, once again, the logical forms of
     these very reductions involve 3-adic relations at every step
     of the corresponding analyses.

JA:  For example, contemplate the 3-adic relation that is expressed by
     the rheme "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- and then ---",
     of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt;, and which
     one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:

|                        Jack
|                       o
|                      /
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
|                      \
|                       o
|                        Jill

JA:  Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
     of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
     where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.

JA:  The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
     of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
     is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
     of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
     suggest by means of the following scheme:

|                        Jack
|                [LP1]--o
|                 /      \
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12]
|                 \      /
|                [LP2]--o
|                        Jill

JA:  In this picture, the 2-adic relations LP1, LP2, and L12
     are defined to capture forms of pairwise relations like:

     LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2nd component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
                      y is the 2nd component
                      in some ordered pair.

JA:  Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
     defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
     it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:

     LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP2 (q, y).

JA:  This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
     that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
     all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
     if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
     There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
     2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
     composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
     have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.

JA:  I would like to interject a note of reservation at this juncture,
     since the definition of LP12 that I gave above is not yet in the
     form that I would consider the tip-top shape for perfect clarity.
     The main thing that it lacks in its current shape is any sort of
     careful circumscriptions of the so-called "domains of definition"
     for the assorted relations that serve defined and defining roles.
     Just as a thing to think about, you might well see reason to ask:
     "What is the domain of definition for the variable q?"  But I do
     not want to get bogged down in all of that now, so let's move on.
     Still, it helps to name these domains:  so "Q", "X", "Y" will do.

JA:  Also, while I'm at it, allow me to convert my temporary terminology
     into what is more like the "standard-usage-onyms" where I come from.
     As a start, notice that the 2-adic relations LP1 and LP2 are actually
     functions from the domain of q to the domains of x and y, respectively.
     In recognition of this fact, it is usual to give them functional names,
     commonly something like the following reformulations of the definitions:

     1.  Proj&lt;1&gt; : XxY -&gt; X such that Proj&lt;1&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; x.

     2.  Proj&lt;2&gt; : XxY -&gt; Y such that Proj&lt;2&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; y.

JA:  And yet, once again, this entire skirmish to mop-up the residual bits
     of 2-adic structure that may be squeegeed out of the original 3-adic
     relation is being waged only after the general issue has been conceded,
     for we had to use the 3-adic relation associated with the truth-functional
     connective "and" just to express the definition of LP12.

JA:  Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L^0 and L^1
     is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
     At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
     and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
     along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.

JA:  While I await those developments, forgive me if I just keep on talking,
     and, who knows, it may even chance to happen that I will say something
     to give you an idea about the relational situation, one way or another.

JA:  What we have just now established, a little ways above,
     is that an ordered pair q is determined by this "data":
     a couple of 2-adic relations, in particular, functions,
     whose names are not of any great importance, but which
     I am now calling the "projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; amd Proj&lt;2&gt;,
     together with the values of q's projections in X and Y.

JA:  Here is a sort of picture that can be useful in helping us
     to remember what is essential in this kind of a relational
     situation, beneath the vast bewildering array of notations:

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o       q   o
|   x7 o     / \ o y7
|    x6 o   /   * y6
|     x5 o /   o y5
|      x4 *   o y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y

JA:  This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
     that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
     that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
     that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
     that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.

MW:  Now the "semantics" of the linking relations should support
     the derivation of something more complex, but that is all.

JA:  It should support the formal recognition of "something more complex",
     namely, a 3-adic relation which is not reducible to 2-adic relations.

MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
     for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
     that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
     then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
     statement about how I see relations.

JA:  This is another one of those places where I fear that we might
     be using the word "relation" in some radically divergent way,
     since I would not naturally speak of a relation in general as
     representing anything, since relations are primarily objects
     of discussion and thought to me, and not syntactic entities.
     The special brand of a relation that I call a "sign relation"
     does indeed have two of its three feet in realms of signs,
     and there are many types of relations that I would choose
     for "modeling" objects and processes in the world, and
     there are very special sorts of relational structures
     in mathematics that are called "group representations",
     so maybe there is a bridge ahead, but I cannot be sure.

MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
     They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
     infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
     combinations of things, and then I see a further
     infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
     ourselves to those where all the members of the
     set have the same adacity).

MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of them,
     but to a very small subset we choose (note the word choose)
     to map our experiences of the world to in terms of connections
     (broad sense) that we see between things.

MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the world
     and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how to do it).
     I'm not sure you share that view.

MW:  I would suggest that we talked more about what was being represented
     rather than how it was being represented.  I suspect that we would
     then find more to agree about.

JA:  I am afraid that we can only talk about things in so far as we represent them.

JA:  As an object example, taken for the moment in the converse direction
     of synthesis, joining an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already
     an element of a 3-adic relation, just as every other "binary operation"
     is a 3-adic relation.

MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.  Binary operations
     are of the form F : a -&gt; b, and even though a and b might be quite
     complex, the essential form is binary.

JA:  I would say that the accidental form, even the superficial form is binary --
     anything at all can be glossed over with a superficially simple appearance --
     it is our job precisely to detect and to reveal the underlying complexities.

Here, let me try to explain it to you this way.
The following table presents the 3-adic relation
that is otherwise known as the 2-ary operation of
conjunction, commonly symbolized by "and" or "&amp;":

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

Now, let us suppose that you are a humble Data Scrivener,
as I once was, and your not-so-humble Boss comes to your
cubicle one day, no doubt pursuant to that data downsize
directive that I encouraged you to explore in a previous
scenario, and tells you that you need to get this simple
structure into a 2-column table at most, which being the
true believer in economy that you are you promptly do as
follows:

o-----------o---------o
|&lt; x  ,  y &gt;| z = x&amp;y |
o-----------o---------o
|&lt; 0  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 0  ,  1 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  1 &gt;|    1    |
o-----------o---------o

Whereupon you are promptly rewarded with a well-deserved
promotion at twice your former salary for the incredible
shrinking cost you have thereby beneficed your unit with!

In yer dreams ...

JA:  Now, there are good reasons for proceeding further, that is,
     once the omnipresence of 3-adic relations in every analytic
     project is conceded, but perhaps it would be best for me to
     halt at this point and see if we have any form of agreement
     about this much, at least.

MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
     We are talking about representation of things, rather
     than what things are.

JA:  The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated knowledge of being,
     is not a day that I think any of our sort will see this side of heaven.
     The only way that we "fallible and mortal finite information creatures"
     have to approach the One and the Universal is via the Many Appearances,
     by taking up as many different styles and types of representations as
     we can fathom, and then, by way of transformations on them, to distill
     what invariants, half concealing and half disclosing, they may manifest.

MW:  If we set the representation by relations of particular adacity
     aside, I think we would find much more to agree about.

JA:  Well, that is a heavenly notion.

JA:  The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the
     circumstance that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
     from an element of one.

MW:  Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
     of what a relation is to me.  This would easily explain how we
     have been missing each other.

JA:  I will take up the task of that refinement at my next opportunity.
