Ian -- 
   I think it is a good thing to keep these discussions as concrete
as possible, and your merged ontology, and the synopsis of the higfhest
levels in your note are very good contributions.
   To take up your invitation:
&gt; I invite everyone to examine these concepts . . .

   with regard to the suggested top several levels:

&gt; 
&gt; Entity
&gt;         Physical
&gt;                 Object
&gt;                 Process
&gt;         Relation
&gt;         Abstract
&gt;                 Set
&gt;                 Proposition
&gt;                 Quantity
&gt;                 Attribute
&gt; 
   I have mentioned previously that the creation of an "abstract"
category
as disjoint from "physical" at the highest level is in my view
unnecessry 
and highly undesirable, since it would preclude, for example, the
creation 
of a general concept "object" which subsumes both physical objects and 
abstract objects.  There are other problems, such as if one wants to
define
a space or time as a set (or at least as a collection), it would be
impossible 
in the above classification to consider either as a "physical" concept,
even 
though space-time is as physical as my hand, as I understand current
theories
of cosmology.  One tactic is used by CYC, for example, where the concept
of
"set or collection" is at a very high level, allowing one to treat
groups of
physical objects to some extent like sets, but also allowing purely 
mathematical sets to be defined.
   The main motivating factor in my concern about a high-level
abstract/concrete
distinction is that this would nullify the common and very useful
process of 
creating more general ("abstract") concepts by removing spcific
attributes
or specific defining axioms from lower-level concepts.  It should be
possible
to remove the physical attributes from physical objects and processes to
get
more general concepts that are not physical, but are ancestors to the
physical concepts.
   I am aware that this is not the most common view of the
abstract-concrete
distinction, and to make it more convincing I should create a set of at
least 100
high-level concepts showing their relations in KIF format.  I regret
that I will not
be able to do that before the August meeting.

   An outline of an alternative top few levels could be, just for
illustation
(concepts with a preceding ** have multiple inheritance in this short
classification):

 Entity
    Object
       Physical Object
           Ordinary Matter
               Solid Object
                   Rigid Object
                   **Powder
               Liquid Object
               Gaseous Object
               Semisolid Object
                   **Human being
           Electromagnetic Wave
           Plasma
           Condensed Matter
               Neutron Star
               Black Hole
           Inanimate Object
               Artefact
       Mental Object
           Idea
               Proposition
           Purpose   
       Mathematical Object
           **Mathematical Set 
           **Mathematical function
           Quantifier
               Number
       Agent
           Physical Agent
               Purposive Agent
                   Microbe
                   Plant
                   Animal
                       **Mammal
                            **Human Being
               Inanimate Agent
               Cognitive agent
                   Robot
                   **Mammal
                       **Human being
    Relation
        Function
            Process
                Physical Process
                    Mental Process
                        Communication
                Mathematical Process
            **Mathematical function
        Semantic Relation
    Property (=attribute)
        Location
    Set or Collection
        **Mathematical Set
        Physical collection
            **Powder
        Dimension
           Physical Space Dimension
           Time
        Space
            Abstract space
            Physical space-time
    State
        Physical State


   Much of importance has been left out, and there are other concepts
in most of these categories that have been left out, this is 
just presented as an illustration of why high-level "abstract" is
unnecessarily constraining.  It is particularly a problem where
we hope that the SUO will be useful as a common basis for as many
lower-level ontologies as can fit into any one "ontological commitment".
The illustrative hierarchy here is not the only one that could be
created without an abstract/physical dichotomy, and many others might
be justs as useful or more useful.
    The justification of these choices and axiomatization to reflect 
the meaningful relations will require more time than I can provide in
the immediate future, but I believe that this classification is 
consistent and will be more useful than one with a highest-level
abstract/physical dichotomy.  I hope to be able to provide more
detailed comments on specific concepts by the time of the meeting.
