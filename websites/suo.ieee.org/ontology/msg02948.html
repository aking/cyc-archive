&gt; I would suggest that we make a distinction
&gt; between consciousness (of inference) and inference.

&gt; I am not convinced that what we introspect/reflect on as an inference process
&gt; is the only kind.  In fact, I doubt it;  I think that most inference is in fact
&gt; unconscious (but because &quot;unconscious&quot; is a loaded term, perhaps it's better to
&gt; say &quot;unaware of&quot;).
&gt;
&gt; I think in general that we (humans) are notoriously deficient
&gt; at describing on introspection our own mental processes except
&gt; in very general terms.  Many of us will say &quot;That's not how I
&gt; do it&quot; when via reflection it doesn't seem that an inference
&gt; process has taken place.  We remember the original &quot;pattern&quot;
&gt; and our action/response/conclusion.  There is no formal
&gt; sequence of modus ponens, we think.
&gt; 
&gt; In another realm (but related), witness language.
&gt; As fluent speakers of a language, we think we
&gt; understand language, but that is not generally
&gt; true -- at least if you believe linguists.
&gt; Our naive understanding of how we create and
&gt; understand language is not necessarily very
&gt; insightful.  It's not usually the best theory.
&gt; 
&gt; So then if logic and mathematics (and so, science) is always a
&gt; &quot;description&quot; after the fact of real-time processes or reality,
&gt; and are not &quot;explanations&quot;, what constitutes an explanation or
&gt; equivalently (I would say), a theory?  [Now, I don't want to
&gt; discuss here Goedel/Chaitlin foundations of math issues;
&gt; they are important but in a different context.]
&gt; 
&gt; What is the process the animal goes through?
&gt; Is it hard-wired &quot;instinct&quot;, whatever that is?
&gt; And even if it is, what does that mean?  If we
&gt; say: oh, it's the firing of neurons in a certain
&gt; way or flow across a finite state network in a
&gt; certain way, and we leave it at that, we are not
&gt; really interested in understanding what occurs.
&gt; I would say, it *is* the firing of neurons in a
&gt; certain way, that that certain way is responsive
&gt; to the &quot;truth&quot; of real world situations, and that
&gt; certain way can be described, one can propose
&gt; a theory of that certain way which is better
&gt; than other theories.

Leo,

I think you are pointing to a distinction between psychology and logic.
Psychology is a descriptive science, and cognitive psychology endeavors
to observe and to describe 'how we think'.  Logic is a normative science.
It says something like:  &quot;If you have such and such goals, the aims that
are proper to a certain mode of deliberate thought, then here is how you
ought to conduct your thinking process, if you want to succeed at it.&quot;

The relationship between these is an old wound in pragmatic thought,
being one of the issues that divided Peirce from James and Dewey,
though Dewey had time to get it better straightened out later.

Part of the problem that we have in thinking about this stuff
is that we have been handed such ramshackle conceptual tools
to try and tackle it with, mostly a lot of dichotomies and
dyadic relations when what is called for are trichotomies
and triadic relations.

In my own efforts I form the analogy with Chomsky's distinction
between competence models and performance models of any capacity,
which trace back to a theme in Aristotle that distinguishes between
the mode of 'episteme', rendered as &quot;possession of knowledge&quot;, and
the mode of 'theorein', rendered as &quot;exercise of knowledge&quot;.  And
yet Aristotle -- strangely enough, given what we have been taught,
though it turns out to be a generic aspect of his thinking if one
reads what he actually wrote -- anyway, Aristotle verges on using
a trichotomy here, dimly highlighting the scheme that involves
possession (competence knowledge), exercise ('how to' knowledge)
and critical reflection (descriptive and/or normative knowledge).

Jon
