John (et al.)

I have a couple of problems with your answer(s).

You seem to be suggesting that we (1) do not examine the philosophical
issues but (2) adopt a position of naïve realism within which we can answer
all the questions we need to.

It seems to me that there is an element of schizophrenia in point (1) as you
quite explicitly take Peirce's philosophical work as your starting point
(basis).

As to point (2) - you say "As soon as you ask that question, you open
Pandora's box
of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
Java, etc."

My experience is very different. When I see people trying and build
structures such as the SUO, one of the interesting observations is that
there is no consensus to take advantage of. No intuitive framework that can
be consistently specified. And that it is extremely difficult to discuss the
problems they encounter - or describe the results of their analysis - using
just ordinary language without some kind of philosophical intuition. Matthew
West's experience formalizing engineering data is one good example of this.
Look at the latest SWIFT standards for another. We find ourselves coming up
against the sort of problems that philosophers discuss (as we have done
here). And we need the kind of answers they give to tidy up our framework.
The nub of the problem seems to me that "SQL, FORTRAN, C, Java, etc" are not
going to answer the problems by themselves.

The fact that philosophers have not agreed on the nature of the world does
not automatically make their input worthless. Any more than that theoretical
physicists have not agreed on the nature of the world. Philosophy has
provided analyses of several important areas - which we can usefully pick
up. We might not want to take advantage of their latest theories - just as
construction engineers do not take advantage of the latest physical
theories. But, it seems to me that provided we are sensible about what we
take, we are going to get a much better job taking a useful philosophical
analysis than trying to recreate it with a fraction of the resources and
experience.

One unpalatable result may be that people who want to build something like
an SUO will need to acquire a working knowledge of some of the philosophical
results. While this might seem like hard work - it is a lot easier in the
long run than trying to recreate the results by oneself.

Regards
Chris

Matthew, Mike, et al.,

That is a very serious and very difficult question:

&gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call what it is in the
real

&gt;world that they refer to?

As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box
of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
Java, etc.

But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they
refer to in the real world?" all hell breaks loose.

You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?

Suggestion:

 1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
    interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
    satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
    is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.

 2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
    purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
    realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
    words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
    let's not worry too much about what it is.

 3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
    the position that KIF is the official language to be used
    for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
    If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.

I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out"
that doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the
same cop out that Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his
Tractatus:  "Everything that can be said can be said clearly,
and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent."

For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some
extra prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in
the SUO] can be said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot
speak [in KIF], thereof we must be silent.

This is not an answer to the question of what do relations
really refer to.  It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the
only kind of cop out that will allow us to get some work done.

John Sowa
