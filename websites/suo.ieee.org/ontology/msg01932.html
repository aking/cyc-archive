Jim, 
	.	A couple of thoughts on your suggestions below.  

	.	Maybe we could participate in the IEEE group that is
developing the e-mail balloting rules, etc.? What with its currency for us,
we are likely to be aware of some of the less evident pitfalls. 

	.	My gut feel is that a number around 4 would be a good number
for bringing on a vote, rather than choosing a fixed proportion.
Alternatively, the proportion could be non-linear, for example, the square
root of the number of participants (or perhaps, say, 80% of the square root
of the number of participants - to compensate for rounding numbers upwards)
could be a good proportion.

Bob and all,
Our next higher body is working on a variation of RRO for email groups, but
they are finding it's a larger effort than they anticipated. We could
certainly also try but I fear this could take far longer than expected and
sap a lot of energy. Perhaps we should form a subgroup and set up a separate
list for these discussions. 
I forget who suggested today that we try to work within Robert's Rules and
see if it works. This is probably worth a try. If it works, great. If it
doesn't, we'll know for sure we need to adopt something different. 
If we do make changes, I suggest the following: To conduct a vote, you would
need half as many supporters as would be needed for the vote to pass. If
half is too many, maybe only a third. Example: If we anticipated 20 YES/NO
votes(based on prior votes), 11 would be needed to pass, and half would be
6, so 6 voting members would be needed to bring a motion to a vote. Another
example: If the Chair believes there may be enough support to pass
something, he or she may ask if there are any objections to a motion.
Following the same rule, if 5 people objected, it would be forced to a vote
(If 20 votes were cast, 10 NO votes would prevent it from passing, so half
of that is 5). This might sound a bit complicated at first reading, but I
think it would be rather simple to administer. The benefit would be fewer
votes. Under Robert's Rules, 2 people can force a vote on just about
anything.
Jim

All, 
In a message dated 01/31/01 Robert Spillers wrote: 
Since there have been several statements that the IEEE is silent about
voting procedures in this type of group, as a separate matter I will propose
a set of voting rules for the group's consideration, comments, revision,
etc. If the group can come to a general agreement on a particular procedure,
then I will move that they be formally adopted.
We later told that the WG rules of procedure are Robert's Rules. Still later
we were told that the rules are essentially what ever the chair thinks is
best. After the pending issues are resolved, I will propose a set of rules
that are (I hope) a few simple changes to Robert's Rules. 
Since Robert's Rules cover many circumstances that are unlikely to occur,
but could occur, I think it wise to maintain the base and change a few
things that make them more useful to an email group. These changes will deal
with issues like a quorum (in an email discussion group, I think a quorum is
always present - if a few days notice is given for a vote), making and
seconding motions, how votes are counted, etc. 
I ask that those who are interested think about what changes are appropriate
and I would appreciate suggestions after current issues are resolved. 
Thanks, 
Bob
