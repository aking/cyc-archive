&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You mean you model one thing x standing in relation R
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to another thing y by including the pair &lt;x,y&gt; in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set that represents (or, is identical with) R (again,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the usual way)?  Ok.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- note:  only binary relations are used.         &lt;&lt;&lt;---&lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What you mean is:  "only binary relations are mentioned."   &lt;&lt;&lt;---&lt;&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Yes, that is the sense of "used" I had in mind.

Not to mention the "forms of operation" (FOO's)
that youse actually use is usually considered
to exhibit a considerable lack of reflection.
Not to reflect on the use of the legs that
youse actually use on which to run may be
alright for the pre-millennial-pedestrian
brand of sodware that we all know so well,
but it is increasingly less often considered
a "best practice" in software design, or
even very healthy as a FOL'o'sophy of life.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems bizarre to me to limit oneself in principle
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to binary relations.  Giving, for example, is a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; natural 3-place relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is principally to minimise structural constraints
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where all places in a relation must be filled,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when some are not known.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes no sense to me whatever.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes good sense to me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I hear Matthew indicating is a preference
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; akin to a preference for a normalized database.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I forget where this bit started, so I will just break in here ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wish that those of you who fail to see the cogency of various
&gt; &gt; logical arguments on this score would try at least the following
&gt; &gt; experiment:  Amble on down the mountain to the ordinary zen world
&gt; &gt; of your friendly local neighborhood Data Group, and tell them that
&gt; &gt; due to the latest round of corporate down-sizing, all relational
&gt; &gt; data tables will now be restricted to just two columns, not two
&gt; &gt; plus a key or two plus an index, just two, and that this rule
&gt; &gt; will be strictly enforced right down to the bare bones level
&gt; &gt; of assembly language, no funny business with hidden indices
&gt; &gt; and secret keys tucked away to the various nooks and crannies
&gt; &gt; in which your average computer geeks know how to squirrel away
&gt; &gt; all of their best kernels'o'wit if not to say their bits'o'honey.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Well "in the real world" it would be more than two columns,
&gt; even if that was the conceptual model you started with.  Lets just
&gt; run through what you might have on a table representing a relation.
&gt; 
&gt; ThingID
&gt; 
&gt; A surrogate for the relation instance, so that it can be
&gt; referred to in other relations.  This is a practical point.
&gt; In KIF you can just repeat teh whole relation whenever you
&gt; want to refer to it.  In a relational database you can't put
&gt; a whole relation in a column, so you have to put a reference
&gt; to it there.

You are now at 1-adic relations.

I believe I mentioned that keys and indices count as columns.
In general, a k-place relation plus 1 key is a (k+1)-place relation.

&gt; Referenced1
&gt; 
&gt; The first element in the relation.

You are now at 2-adic relations.

&gt; Referenced2
&gt; 
&gt; The second element in the relation.

You are now at 3-adic relations.

&gt; Relation
&gt; 
&gt; If you had noticed that all your relations were binary,
&gt; after a bit you might notice that you had maybe 100 tables
&gt; all with the same structure.  You would probably spot that
&gt; for adding one column with the relation in it you could
&gt; reduce that to 1 table.

You are now at 4-adic relations.

&gt; RecordID
&gt; 
&gt; The record is an object as well as what it refers to, and in some
&gt; circumstances it may be an object of interest. Providing a record ID
&gt; gives a clean way to do this. Don't expect to see this except from
&gt; people who take signs seriously.

You are now at 5-adic relations.

&gt; Record Creation Date
&gt; 
&gt; The date the record was created. I am assuming here that the relation
&gt; instance is timeless, but the record of it certainly isn't. As an
&gt; alternative, you might keep records of system actions, in which case
&gt; this could be dealt with elsewhere.

You are now at 6-adic relations.

&gt; Record Logical Deletion Date
&gt; 
&gt; We would not generally physcally delete records,
&gt; but logically delete them.  This means you can
&gt; get back to a previous database state.

You are now at 7-adic relations.

&gt; So what's that?  7 columns. Same principle though.

7 &gt; 2.

Ergo, I fail to understand your point with the rest of this.

&gt; &gt; What will happen?  Most likely, from experience, one of two things:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  They will go away mumbling something about "turd normal farm",
&gt; &gt;     and wondering what brand'o'moron or other rough beast has now
&gt; &gt;     come round alas to rake over the company.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  Having learned, from experience, to be play-along sorts of folks,
&gt; &gt;     they will say "Sure, Boss! Get right on it!", and go away doing
&gt; &gt;     precisely what they always do, knowing that none'o'you prophets
&gt; &gt;     would ever have even the first clue where to look for the nuts.
&gt;
&gt; MW: Well it's funny you should mention that ...
&gt; 
&gt; We didn't set any such rules, but we did end up with a data model
&gt; with just about that structure, and when we took it to these folks
&gt; (some 8 or 9 years ago now) they just looked at us exactly as you
&gt; described and said that was impossible/impractical.  But as the good
&gt; theoreticians we are, we asked them for the proof (evidence even) for
&gt; their claims.  They replied that there was no proof or evidence for
&gt; their claims, but that it was "obvious".  We suggested that a little
&gt; experiment would settle the matter, and probably to humour us our
&gt; colleagues agreed.  They even gave us help in doing the experiments.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course with the first experiment there were some little
&gt; compromises at the edges, but do you know what, it actually
&gt; did work.  Performance wasn't sparkling, but we could get
&gt; things done.  We could do some neat stuff that having such
&gt; a flexible structure made possible that "traditional" designs
&gt; couldn't touch.  And it turned out things were mostly breaking
&gt; down around the compromises we made.
&gt; 
&gt; So there were a number of other experiments, each pushing back
&gt; on more and more assumptions, until we did end up with something
&gt; looking pretty much like what I have suggested above, in what we
&gt; called a "reduced table design" because there were fewer tables
&gt; than entity types in the data model.  In fact one of our most
&gt; successful experiments had just one table.
&gt; 
&gt; This gave us the basis of a database design where the design
&gt; was independent of what you wanted to hold data about, i.e. in
&gt; principle it could hold any data about anything, without changing
&gt; the database design.  There are couple of areas where that flexibility
&gt; can be extremely useful.  One of those is reference data, such as asset
&gt; data where I have been working for some years now.  The other area is
&gt; Management Information, a direction some of my colleagues took these
&gt; ideas.  So $30m later, whilst I have been developing standards for
&gt; engineering data, they have been developing a Management Information
&gt; System called Kalido (think kaleidoscope).  This uses a meta data
&gt; management approach to creating and managing MIS data warehouses.
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.kalido.com/">http://www.kalido.com/</A> for more information.
&gt;
&gt; Shell has implemented Kalido in more than 100 locations worldwide,
&gt; and it provides the backbone of our management information.
&gt; 
&gt; Today the software is a V6, Kalido Ltd is established as
&gt; a separate company (currently wholely owned by Shell) and
&gt; Kalido is a product you can buy -- if you have deep enough
&gt; pockets.  The product architect -- Chris Angus, is on this
&gt; list and contributes occasionally.
&gt; 
&gt; So I guess it isn't all talk and theory.

You now understand the meaning of the words "just play along".
