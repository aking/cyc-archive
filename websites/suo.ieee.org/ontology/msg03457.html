Greetings Ontology List subscribers,

        I hope nobody on this list objects, but Jon Awbery has requested
a thread be moved to this list.

&gt; 
&gt; 3.  I am prepared to argue that my present lines of contribution have
&gt;     more pertinence to the Scope &amp; Purpose of the SUO Working Group,
&gt;     a higher quality overall, and a better rationale on many points
&gt;     than various parallels in the current Starter Documents.

JS: 'Pertinence to the Scope and Purpose' is not good enough.  We could
spend eternity on things that meet this criteria.  We are chartered to
develop a standards document, not advance the field of upper ontologies. 
Your 1000+ (I'm guessing) postings have not contributed much of any
standards words.

JS: You have stated your dislike for both started documents, but have not
offered much of any specific help in improving them.  In standards
development, criticisms without suggested improvements are of little
value.  Also, the fact that you don't like what this group is working on
does not give you the right to set your own agenda (i.e. conduct
research) and eat up bandwidth with it.  And the fact that don't think
the group can succeed without your research work does not give you the
right to 

JS: If you believe the group cannot succeed without your research, there
is a proper way to submit your work.  You should either submit your own
starter document, or submit comments to the other starter documents.  
But it is not acceptable to conduct this research in this forum without
any relationship to the work of this group.  Again, it is not enough that
it relates to the Scope and Purpose.

JA:  &gt; 4.  You do not seem to get the fact that I am doing my level best
&gt;     to accord you the professional service of telling you exactly
&gt;     how these prospective standards will be judged by the academic,
&gt;     professional, and user communities with which I am very 
&gt; familiar.
&gt;     I simply think that it is better that the Group should hear 
&gt; about
&gt;     it now, while there is still time to fix it, rather than waiting
&gt;     to roundly ridiculed by the first elect body of external experts
&gt;     to which these inept pretensions of expertise present 
&gt; themselves.
&gt;     Hear me now, and believe me later, as I think the line goes.

JS: Standards groups start with a document and improve it.  It helps
little to just criticize it.  You should help to improve one of both
documents.  If you don't think either are worth your input, you should
either submit your own starter document, listen quietly, or leave.  You
should not eat up bandwidth with your research. 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;

JA:  I request that you present
&gt; reasoned arguments for your so far completely bald objections
&gt; to the pertinence, the quality, and the rationality of my
&gt; current contributions, or else cease to assert them.

JS: I don't question the quality or rationality of your postings.  I have
explained why they are pertinent.


&gt; 
JA:  &gt; With respect to procedural issues, the role of research, a 
&gt; reasonable timeline
&gt; for the project, and many other issues of that nature, my positions 
&gt; are quite
&gt; the same as more seasoned members of this group.  

JS: The charter rules, which is to develop a standards document, not
advance the field of ontology.  If certain members don't think this is
achievable,  they are free to not participate, but they can't change the
charter to focus on research. 

JS: If members want to do research, I've a couple times offered to help
set up an IEEE task force, which could become an 'IEEE Technical
Committee.'  Nobody showed interest.

JA:  In these regards, 
&gt; I request
&gt; that you quit picking on me -- just because you can -- and start 
&gt; picking on
&gt; somebody your own size.

JS:  You are receiving more guidance than others because you post far
more messages than anyone else.  If you were to drop back to a much lower
number, nobody would complain.  Others do post the same types of research
postings as you, but small enough quantities that don't cause a problem. 
But I have sent guidance to others, and most of them follow it, while you
do not cooperate.  This is why I am pushing this so hard with you.

JS: Please respond to my points, but please don't twist my words.  

Jim Schoening
