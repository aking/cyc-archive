Jim, 
	.	Thanks for this. What I wanted to achieve was explicit
consideration of the corporate issue, so that it wasn't unwittingly taken
advantage of. 

	.	I believe that has been achieved.

Graham, Tim, and Nicola, 
These are all valid suggestions, and some are successfully used in other
organizations; however, IEEE offers just two options for voting rights with
a Working Group (Individual or Entity) and that must be established before
submission of the PAR. 
These voting rights apply only to the Working Group, which will develop the
document and vote to forward it for formal IEEE balloting. The Balloting
Group will likely include most of the Working Group, but also includes
others with a stake in the standard. It is the Balloting Group that must be
balanced, not the Working Group. 
Within IEEE, a single organization can have multiple voting members of
Working Group, and even on a Balloting Group. With 25 people casting votes
on the Scope and Purpose, we have more than enough participants to assure
that no single organization could have too much weight. 
We should also not worry too much about voting at the Working Group level.
The real goal is to build maximum consensus so the standard gets approved by
the Balloting Group and adopted by the market.

	Interestingly enough, Graham's proposal is in direct contrast to the
ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials), which only allows one
representative from one organisation to be a voting member of committees
(membership is by individuals). The other aspect to ensure appropriate
voting is that a committee must have a balanced mix of producers, users,
consumers, and general interest (e.g. government and academia). These may
not quite work for our activity but I think that there is a useful principle
here. I believe that both of these ideas would be more manageable than
Graham's ideas; very few of us seem to have sufficient official blessing for
our participation from our organisations to allow us to wield block votes.
	As ever, 
	Tim.

		Jim, 
		. I could see some merit in recognising the greater, but not
overwhelming, significance of relevant corporate / government institutions.
What I have in mind is that significant institutions could otherwise either
be ignored, or alternatively swamp, a group such as this. I would see the
aim as to have appropriate weightings given to the voice of larger bodies,
without loosing the value of insights and opinions of individuals. 
		. My impression is that is generally handled by giving such
institutions voting rights corresponding to a number, say 5 or 10,
individual members, to be used at the institution's discretion, such as
according votes to individual representatives or delegating a corporate
vote. In view of the absence of membership fees to this group, SUO members
should perhaps be obliged to declare financial relationships (eg.
employment, contract, etc.) with member institutions as a marker of
representation.

Subject: SUO: Establishing voting rights 
		&gt; SUO Participants: 
		&gt; 
		&gt; Now that our project has officially been chartered by IEEE
(IEEE 
		&gt; P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology Working Group), we need to
establish 
		&gt; voting rights. 
		&gt; 
		&gt; Default Policies &amp; Procedures (P&amp;Ps) are provided to us by
the IEEE 
		&gt; Computer Society Standards Activity Board (see 
		&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.computer.org/standards/ORIENT/p&amp;ptoc.htm">http://www.computer.org/standards/ORIENT/p&amp;ptoc.htm</A>
&lt;<A  HREF="http://www.computer.org/standards/ORIENT/p&amp;ptoc.htm">http://www.computer.org/standards/ORIENT/p&amp;ptoc.htm</A>&gt; ) but these do not 
		&gt; specify voting rights within a working group. Rights in
most standards 
		&gt; groups are based on attendance at meetings (usually 2 of 3
prior 
		&gt; meetings), but since this group is working via email
reflectors, we'll 
		&gt; need to establish our own rules. 
		&gt; 
		&gt; I propose the following: 
		&gt; 
		&gt; SUO Voting Rights Clause: 
		&gt; 
		&gt; Voting rights shall be granted to any individual with a
material interest 
		&gt; in the development of this standard who either was a
participant of this 
		&gt; group during its formation (see para. d.) or has been a
participant for a 
		&gt; waiting period of 6-months. 
		&gt; 
		&gt; a. 'Voting Rights' refers to the list of who may vote on
formal 
		&gt; ballots taken by the SUO WG. If an individual does not
have voting rights, 
		&gt; he or she may still submit comments on a vote and
participate in 
		&gt; discussions to resolve those comments. 
		&gt; 
		&gt; b. 'Material Interest' is defined (still seeking a
definition for 
		&gt; this) 
		&gt; 
		&gt; c. A 'participant' is any individual (IEEE membership NOT
required 
		&gt; or expected) who submits an application 
		&gt; (<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/SUO-Participants-Jan2001.xls">http://suo.ieee.org/SUO-Participants-Jan2001.xls</A>
&lt;<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/SUO-Participants-Jan2001.xls">http://suo.ieee.org/SUO-Participants-Jan2001.xls</A>&gt; ) and participates in any

		&gt; one of the following ways (subscribes to any SUO
discussion list, posts 
		&gt; messages to lists, comments on documents, or any other
actions the Chair 
		&gt; deems to be participation). 
		&gt; 
		&gt; d. Voting rights will be granted dfathered to all those
who 
		&gt; participated in this WG prior to Jan 9, 2001 and who
submit an application 
		&gt; form within 30 days of announcement of approval of this
clause. New 
		&gt; participants must submit the application and then wait
6-months. 
		&gt; 
		End of Clause. 
		The 6-month waiting period is consistent with the typical 
		'attendance at 2 of 3 prior meetings' rule and is needed to
avoid an influx 
		of voters members to sway a particular vote. 
		&gt; Comments are requested on the above proposed clause.
Anyone else is 
		&gt; welcome to submit their own version or approach to this
need. Since we 
		&gt; haven't established voting rights, we can't very well take
a formal vote 
		&gt; on this clause, so let's just work through any comments
and see if we can 
		&gt; reach consensus. 
		&gt;
