&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to put some more time in on the concrete examples,
&gt; and clear away everything that's been said a number of times,
&gt; leaving only the lines of inquiry that still await an answer.
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  So I'm afraid that is not an argument that will
&gt;      convince me on its own.  If you wish to do that
&gt;      you will have to present a specific example of
&gt;      where the information in some triadic relation
&gt;      cannot be transformed into some set of binary
&gt;      relations.  If you provide the triadic relation,
&gt;      I will provide the binary relations from which
&gt;      the triadic relation can be constructed (or not
&gt;      and admit you are right).
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Just to refresh your memory,
&gt;      here are L^0 and L^1 once again:

MW: I had overlooked (rather than ignored) this. Thanks 
for the reminder.

&gt; 
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt; |
&gt; | Relation L^0
&gt; |
&gt; | L^0 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 0}.

MW: I'm not quite sure what this means in English.

&gt; |
&gt; | L^0 has the following four triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:

MW: OK even if I don't fully understand it, I can
treat it as a relation L^0 of form &lt;x, y, z&gt;
until I know better.

&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;

MW: (L^0-row L^0-row1)
    (x L^0-row1 0)
    (y L^0-row1 0)
    (z L^0-row1 0)

&gt; |    &lt;0, 1, 1&gt;

MW: (L^0-row L^0-row2)
    (x L^0-row2 0)
    (y L^0-row2 1)
    (z L^0-row2 1)

&gt; |    &lt;1, 0, 1&gt;

MW: (L^0-row L^0-row3)
    (x L^0-row3 1)
    (y L^0-row3 0)
    (z L^0-row3 1)

&gt; |    &lt;1, 1, 0&gt;

MW: (L^0-row L^0-row4)
    (x L^0-row4 1)
    (y L^0-row4 1)
    (z L^0-row4 0)

&gt; |
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt; |
&gt; | Relation L^1
&gt; |
&gt; | L^1 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 1}.
&gt; |
&gt; | L^1 has the following four triples
&gt; | of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
&gt; |
&gt; |    &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;

MW: (L^1-row L^1-row1)
    (x L^1-row1 0)
    (y L^1-row1 0)
    (z L^1-row1 1)

&gt; |    &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;

MW: (L^1-row L^1-row2)
    (x L^1-row2 0)
    (y L^1-row2 1)
    (z L^1-row2 0)

&gt; |    &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;

MW: (L^1-row L^1-row3)
    (x L^1-row3 1)
    (y L^1-row3 0)
    (z L^1-row3 0)

&gt; |    &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;

MW: (L^1-row L^1-row4)
    (x L^1-row4 1)
    (y L^1-row4 1)
    (z L^1-row4 1)

&gt; |
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt; |
&gt; | Most recent exposition of L^0 &amp; L^1 at:

&gt; |
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the difficulty in getting started on this task lies
&gt; in knowing exactly what it would mean that "the information
&gt; in some triadic relation [can] be transformed into some set
&gt; of binary relations", or even just what, in operational and
&gt; practical terms, may be incumbent on a person who is called
&gt; for to "provide the binary relations from which the triadic
&gt; relation can be constructed".  My sense of it tells me that
&gt; the word "information" plays a critical role in the problem,
&gt; but I will need to think a bit more about how to tackle the
&gt; elicitation and the explication of its bearing on the issue.

MW: What I mean by this is can I reconstruct the original relation
unambiguously, e.g. could I write an SQL view that would generate
the original relation as a view on the new set of relations.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
&gt;      I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
&gt;      any rational sense will come of arguing about any puported form of
&gt;      "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
&gt;      "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
&gt;      unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
&gt;      that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
&gt;      I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
&gt;      since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
&gt;      anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
&gt;      and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
&gt;      at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
&gt;      has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
&gt;      In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
&gt;      number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
&gt;      network of relations there is a path that links them together.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
&gt;      that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
&gt;      this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
&gt;      such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
&gt;      It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
&gt;      3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
&gt;      same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
&gt;      the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
&gt;      are many such special cases of relations, but their existence
&gt;      does not affect the general truth that many 3-adic relations
&gt;      are not of this kind.  And, once again, the logical forms of
&gt;      these very reductions involve 3-adic relations at every step
&gt;      of the corresponding analyses.

MW: So you say.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  For example, contemplate the 3-adic relation that is expressed by
&gt;      the rheme "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- and 
&gt; then ---",
&gt;      of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, 
&gt; Jill&gt;, and which
&gt;      one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; |                        Jack
&gt; |                       o
&gt; |                      /
&gt; |   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
&gt; |                      \
&gt; |                       o
&gt; |                        Jill
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
&gt;      of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
&gt;      where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
&gt;      of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
&gt;      is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
&gt;      of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
&gt;      suggest by means of the following scheme:
&gt; 
&gt; |                        Jack
&gt; |                [LP1]--o
&gt; |                 /      \
&gt; |   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12]
&gt; |                 \      /
&gt; |                [LP2]--o
&gt; |                        Jill
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  In this picture, the 2-adic relations LP1, LP2, and L12
&gt;      are defined to capture forms of pairwise relations like:
&gt; 
&gt;      LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
&gt;                       in the ordered pair q.
&gt; 
&gt;      LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2nd component
&gt;                       in the ordered pair q.
&gt; 
&gt;      L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
&gt;                       y is the 2nd component
&gt;                       in some ordered pair.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
&gt;      defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
&gt;      it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:
&gt; 
&gt;      LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP2 (q, y).
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
&gt;      that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
&gt;      all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
&gt;      if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
&gt;      There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
&gt;      2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
&gt;      composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
&gt;      have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.

MW: I'm not concerned with "decomposable" in the sense you state here. I
am only concerned that if there is some triadic relation, is there some
set of dyadic relations that contain (at least) the same information, i.e.
the triadic relation can be constructed as a view on the dyadic relations.
One might refer to such a set of dyadic relations as a decomposition of
the triadic relation, but not in the sense that you use the word above.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  I would like to interject a note of reservation at this juncture,
&gt;      since the definition of LP12 that I gave above is not yet in the
&gt;      form that I would consider the tip-top shape for perfect clarity.
&gt;      The main thing that it lacks in its current shape is any sort of
&gt;      careful circumscriptions of the so-called "domains of definition"
&gt;      for the assorted relations that serve defined and defining roles.
&gt;      Just as a thing to think about, you might well see reason to ask:
&gt;      "What is the domain of definition for the variable q?"  But I do
&gt;      not want to get bogged down in all of that now, so let's move on.
&gt;      Still, it helps to name these domains:  so "Q", "X", "Y" will do.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Also, while I'm at it, allow me to convert my temporary terminology
&gt;      into what is more like the "standard-usage-onyms" where I come from.
&gt;      As a start, notice that the 2-adic relations LP1 and LP2 are actually
&gt;      functions from the domain of q to the domains of x and y,
respectively.
&gt;      In recognition of this fact, it is usual to give them functional
names,
&gt;      commonly something like the following reformulations of the
definitions:
&gt; 
&gt;      1.  Proj&lt;1&gt; : XxY -&gt; X such that Proj&lt;1&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; x.
&gt;      2.  Proj&lt;2&gt; : XxY -&gt; Y such that Proj&lt;2&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; y.

MW: You lost me here. This is a foreign land, so if there are any
significant
implications of this, you will have to spell them out for me.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  And yet, once again, this entire skirmish to mop-up the residual bits
&gt;      of 2-adic structure that may be squeegeed out of the original 3-adic
&gt;      relation is being waged only after the general issue has been
conceded,
&gt;      for we had to use the 3-adic relation associated with the
truth-functional
&gt;      connective "and" just to express the definition of LP12.

MW: I've got no idea what you are talking about.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L^0 and L^1
&gt;      is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
&gt;      At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
&gt;      and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
&gt;      along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.

MW: I think I've done that now.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  What we have just now established, a little ways above,
&gt;      is that an ordered pair q is determined by this "data":
&gt;      a couple of 2-adic relations, in particular, functions,
&gt;      whose names are not of any great importance, but which
&gt;      I am now calling the "projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; amd Proj&lt;2&gt;,
&gt;      together with the values of q's projections in X and Y.

MW: I am well and truly lost.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Here is a sort of picture that can be useful in helping us
&gt;      to remember what is essential in this kind of a relational
&gt;      situation, beneath the vast bewildering array of notations:
&gt; 
&gt; |           Q
&gt; |           =
&gt; |         X x Y
&gt; |           o
&gt; |          o o
&gt; |         o   o
&gt; |        o     o
&gt; |       o       o
&gt; |      o         o
&gt; |     o       q   o
&gt; |   x7 o     / \ o y7
&gt; |    x6 o   /   * y6
&gt; |     x5 o /   o y5
&gt; |      x4 *   o y4
&gt; |       x3 o o y3
&gt; |        x2 o y2
&gt; |   X     x1 y1     Y
&gt; |
&gt; | This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
&gt; | that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
&gt; | that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
&gt; | that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
&gt; | that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.
&gt; 
MW: Still lost.

&gt; JA:  At this juncture, I would like to demonstrate a few amusing
&gt;      diversions that can be found in this genre of illustrations.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  We have just illustrated the circumstance -- 
&gt; coincidence?  I think not! --
&gt;      that a deux-tuple is determined by the details of its 
&gt; projective pieces --
&gt;      still, according to a sage bit of wisdom, if a 
&gt; deux-tuple did not exist
&gt;      that was determined by the data of its projective parts, 
&gt; then it should
&gt;      be necessary to invent one that was -- which is parably 
&gt; what this bible
&gt;      of pan-categorics tells us about the genesis of every 
&gt; cartesian product:
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  So what if we add another character, yclept "p", let us say,
&gt;      to this little drama of relations that we have set out here?
&gt; 
&gt; |           Q
&gt; |           =
&gt; |         X x Y
&gt; |           o
&gt; |          o o
&gt; |         o   o
&gt; |        o     o
&gt; |       o       o
&gt; |      o         o
&gt; |     o   p   q   o
&gt; |   x7 o / \ / \ o y7
&gt; |    x6 *   .   * y6
&gt; |     x5 o / \ o y5
&gt; |      x4 *   * y4
&gt; |       x3 o o y3
&gt; |        x2 o y2
&gt; |   X     x1 y1     Y
&gt; |
&gt; | This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
&gt; | that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
&gt; | that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
&gt; | that p = &lt;x5, y3&gt;, or, in other words,
&gt; | that Proj&lt;1&gt;(p) = x5, Proj&lt;2&gt;(p) = y3,
&gt; | that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
&gt; | that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.
&gt; 
&gt; We are now looking at a non-trivial 2-adic relation,
&gt; that is, one that has more than one 2-tuple to its name.
&gt; Speaking of which, it has none yet, so let's give it the
&gt; moniker "M&lt;35&gt;", mnemonically, say, for "Move 3 &lt;-&gt; 5".
&gt; 
&gt; Now, one of the interesting things that we can do with
&gt; the "coordinate projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; and Proj&lt;2&gt; is to
&gt; extend their definitions from single points or tuples
&gt; to entire relations, comprising many points or tuples.
&gt; 
&gt; Definition.  For the 2-adic relation L c X x Y, and Proj&lt;j&gt;, j = 1, 2,
&gt; the "projection of L on the j^th axis (or j^th domain)" is defined as:
&gt; 
&gt; Proj&lt;j&gt;(L)  =  {Proj&lt;j&gt;(e) : e in L}.
&gt; 
&gt; Thus, in the present example:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Proj&lt;1&gt;(M&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;1&gt;(p), Proj&lt;1&gt;(q)}  =  {x3, x5}  c  X.
&gt; 2.  Proj&lt;2&gt;(M&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;2&gt;(p), Proj&lt;2&gt;(q)}  =  {y3, y5}  c  Y.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that was such fun that I'm tempted to try another one.

MW: Just double Dutch to me. I suspect I lack the basic mathematics
you are assuming, or at least this way of talking about it.

&gt; Let us then contemplate another non-trivial 2-adic relation,
&gt; oh, I don't know, just pulling a random one out of thin air:
&gt; 
&gt; |           Q
&gt; |           =
&gt; |         X x Y
&gt; |           o
&gt; |          o o
&gt; |         o   o
&gt; |        o     o
&gt; |       o   r   o
&gt; |      o   / \   o
&gt; |     o   /   \   o
&gt; |   x7 o /     \ o y7
&gt; |    x6 *   s   * y6
&gt; |     x5 o / \ o y5
&gt; |      x4 *   * y4
&gt; |       x3 o o y3
&gt; |        x2 o y2
&gt; |   X     x1 y1     Y
&gt; |
&gt; | This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
&gt; | that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
&gt; | that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
&gt; | that r = &lt;x5, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
&gt; | that Proj&lt;1&gt;(r) = x5, Proj&lt;2&gt;(r) = y5,
&gt; | that s = &lt;x3, y3&gt;, or, in other words,
&gt; | that Proj&lt;1&gt;(s) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(s) = y3.
&gt; 
&gt; Let us dub this one as "L&lt;35&gt;", say, on the basis
&gt; of a likely graphical analogy, for "Loop 3 and 5".
&gt; 
&gt; Computing the projections for this example:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Proj&lt;1&gt;(L&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;1&gt;(r), Proj&lt;1&gt;(s)}  =  {x3, x5}  c  X.
&gt; 2.  Proj&lt;2&gt;(L&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;2&gt;(r), Proj&lt;2&gt;(s)}  =  {y3, y5}  c  Y.
&gt; 
&gt; Thus this renders it beyond the shadow of a doubt,
&gt; if it was not already evident from their mugshots,
&gt; that L&lt;35&gt; &amp; M&lt;35&gt; have the very same projections.
&gt; 
&gt; So, what have we learned from this state of affairs?
&gt; Just that, even though single tuples are determined
&gt; by their projection data, that relations themselves,
&gt; generally speaking, are not.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that this is something to think about.

MW: But first I need to understand what you are saying.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; The rest is epilogue.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
&gt;      for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
&gt;      that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
&gt;      then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
&gt;      statement about how I see relations.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
&gt;      They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
&gt;      infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
&gt;      combinations of things, and then I see a further
&gt;      infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
&gt;      ourselves to those where all the members of the
&gt;      set have the same adacity).
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of them,
&gt;      but to a very small subset we choose (note the word choose)
&gt;      to map our experiences of the world to in terms of connections
&gt;      (broad sense) that we see between things.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the world
&gt;      and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how to do it).
&gt;      I'm not sure you share that view.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I would suggest that we talked more about what was being 
&gt; represented
&gt;      rather than how it was being represented.  I suspect 
&gt; that we would
&gt;      then find more to agree about.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  I am afraid that we can only talk about things in so far 
&gt; as we represent them.

MW: So I can only talk about an activity as a relation if that is
how I represent it? I don't think so.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  As an object example, taken for the moment in the 
&gt; converse direction
&gt;      of synthesis, joining an x and a y to form the set {x, 
&gt; y} is already
&gt;      an element of a 3-adic relation, just as every other 
&gt; "binary operation"
&gt;      is a 3-adic relation.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.  Binary operations
&gt;      are of the form F : a -&gt; b, and even though a and b 
&gt; might be quite
&gt;      complex, the essential form is binary.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  I would say that the accidental form, even the 
&gt; superficial form is binary --
&gt;      anything at all can be glossed over with a superficially 
&gt; simple appearance --
&gt;      it is our job precisely to detect and to reveal the 
&gt; underlying complexities.

MW: Interesting. I prefer to reveal the underlying simplicity.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Here, let me try to explain it to you this way.
&gt;      The following table presents the 3-adic relation
&gt;      that is otherwise known as the 2-ary operation of
&gt;      conjunction, commonly symbolized by "and" or "&amp;":
&gt; 
&gt; o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
&gt; o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; |  0  |  0  |    0    |
&gt; |  0  |  1  |    0    |
&gt; |  1  |  0  |    0    |
&gt; |  1  |  1  |    1    |
&gt; o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Now, let us suppose that you are a humble Data Scrivener,
&gt;      as I once was, and your not-so-humble Boss comes to your
&gt;      cubicle one day, no doubt pursuant to that data downsize
&gt;      directive that I encouraged you to explore in a previous
&gt;      scenario, and tells you that you need to get this simple
&gt;      structure into a 2-column table at most, which being the
&gt;      true believer in economy that you are you promptly do as
&gt;      follows:
&gt; 
&gt; o-----------o---------o
&gt; |&lt; x  ,  y &gt;| z = x&amp;y |
&gt; o-----------o---------o
&gt; |&lt; 0  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
&gt; |&lt; 0  ,  1 &gt;|    0    |
&gt; |&lt; 1  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
&gt; |&lt; 1  ,  1 &gt;|    1    |
&gt; o-----------o---------o
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Whereupon you are promptly rewarded with a well-deserved
&gt;      promotion at twice your former salary for the incredible
&gt;      shrinking cost you have thereby beneficed your unit with!
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  In yer dreams ...
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
&gt;      We are talking about representation of things, rather
&gt;      than what things are.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated 
&gt; knowledge of being,
&gt;      is not a day that I think any of our sort will see this 
&gt; side of heaven.
&gt;      The only way that we "fallible and mortal finite 
&gt; information creatures"
&gt;      have to approach the One and the Universal is via the 
&gt; Many Appearances,
&gt;      by taking up as many different styles and types of 
&gt; representations as
&gt;      we can fathom, and then, by way of transformations on 
&gt; them, to distill
&gt;      what invariants, half concealing and half disclosing, 
&gt; they may manifest.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  If we set the representation by relations of particular adacity
&gt;      aside, I think we would find much more to agree about.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Well, that is a heavenly notion.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the
&gt;      circumstance that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
&gt;      from an element of one.

MW: But there is no difference, except in perspective.
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  OK well let me first try to state a method,
&gt;      you will have to forgive some lack of formality,
&gt;      but it should not be so unclear what I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Where I come from this method would be
&gt;      informally known as reification.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Gasp!
&gt; 
&gt; I do not know why I was so astonished by this usage
&gt; that I could not even comment on it for several days.
&gt; I have certainly seen enough "cargo cultism" here and
&gt; there in my time -- and web culture seems to be utterly
&gt; drenched in it -- to know that new rites for old spells
&gt; are constanly burbling up all the time, and it appears
&gt; that the furthest thought from the minds of the sort
&gt; of flock who are busily compillaging our brave new
&gt; wörterbücher would be to cast their whatevery eyes
&gt; upon the decks of those rapedly obsolescing brands.
&gt; And so it should not shock me too much that old words
&gt; are getting new twists, often to the point of torture,
&gt; day by day -- and who knows, it may be that I, too, have
&gt; inadvertently been responsible for a turn or two, myself,
&gt; but then I remind myself that the word that has been turned,
&gt; by degrees, to the point where it now bears a sense 180 about
&gt; from the sense that it onetime had, well, if things keep going
&gt; on this way, then one day that word may come to be revolved 360,
&gt; and thus have its leaning restored to its once and future meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; At any rate, when I was I child, we called this "codification",
&gt; but now that I am no longer a child I know it as "sublimation".
&gt; 
&gt; I am collating the various versions of your methodology below,
&gt; and I am also altering the notation slightly to avoid clashes.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Purpose:
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  To take any n-adic relation occurrence
&gt;      and turn it into n binary relations
&gt;      without loss of meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; V2:  To take what is represented by an n-ary relation,
&gt;      and represent it by n binary relations and
&gt;      a set/class of objects.
&gt; 
&gt; I am taking the sense of your later explanations to be
&gt; that "n-adic relation occurrence" is just an "n-tuple",
&gt; otherwise known as an "n-adic relation instance".  (?)

MW: Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, it would only be interesting if an entire n-adic relation,
&gt; not just a single n-tuple, was being converted into 2-adic relations,
&gt; right?

MW: Of course.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Method:
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  Create an object (say e) that stands for
&gt;      the n-adic relation [instance] as a whole.
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  e replaces the tuple rather than a relation.
&gt;      So e replaces &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  This does not mean that e = &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  there is a relationship, but it is one of
&gt;      derivability rather than equality.
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  Take each each element in the relation occurrence
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  The relation occurrence is a tuple,
&gt;      an element is the thing in a place in a tuple.
&gt; 
&gt;      So &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; V1:  and create a relation between it and x.
&gt; 
&gt; V2:  For each tuple 
&gt; 
&gt;      &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;      that is a member of the n-ary relation (L) create exactly
&gt;      one object (e) that is a member of the set of objects (E).
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Just for the sake of concreteness as I attempt to follow along,
&gt;      let me try this method out on one or two of the above examples.
&gt; 
&gt; Relation L(&amp;) = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x &amp; y = z}.
&gt; 
&gt; o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
&gt; o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; |  0  |  0  |    0    |
&gt; |  0  |  1  |    0    |
&gt; |  1  |  0  |    0    |
&gt; |  1  |  1  |    1    |
&gt; o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  So, for each tuple &lt;x, y, z&gt; in L(&amp;)
&gt;      create exactly one object e in set E.
&gt; 
&gt;      E  =  {e&lt;0&gt;, e&lt;1&gt;, e&lt;2&gt;, e&lt;3}.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Why don't we get really clever and
&gt;      use a binary index for the e's?
&gt; 
&gt;      E  =  {e&lt;00&gt;, e&lt;01&gt;, e&lt;10&gt;, e&lt;11&gt;}.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  For each component of the tuple create a binary tuple
&gt;      that is a member of a relation that indicates the place
&gt;      in the original tuple that the component stands in,
&gt;      e.g.
&gt; 
&gt;      place1 &lt;e, component1&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  I will revert to my custom here and employ the
&gt;      standard-use-onyms of "coordinate projections".
&gt; 
&gt;      Proj&lt;1&gt;(e) = x.
&gt;      Proj&lt;2&gt;(e) = y.
&gt;      Proj&lt;3&gt;(e) = z.

MW: You lost me again.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  e.g. if I have:
&gt; 
&gt;      (gives1 John Mary Book1)
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  If I apply the above method I might get:
&gt; 
&gt;      (gives2 e)
&gt;      (giver-in John e)
&gt;      (receiver-in Mary e)
&gt;      (given-in Book1 e)
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  To be honest, I worry a little about this rendition,
&gt;      but I shall render under unto KIFer what is KIFer's.
&gt;      As it stands, I do not know what it's trying to say.
&gt;      Is there supposed to be some sort of equivalence?
&gt;      I do not see that "(gives2 e)" is at all simpler.
&gt;      I have trouble understanding how the materials that
&gt;      you have assembled here are supposed to do anything
&gt;      at all but restate an application of the relation
&gt;      in a different font, as it were.

MW: simpler is only that what was ternary is now binary. You
have also recognised the giving event/activity explicitly as
and object, which many (including myself) would consider an
improved representation of what is happening.
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~RESIDUE~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Use the role that the element plays
&gt;      in the original relation to name
&gt;      this binary relation.
&gt; 
&gt; | Example:
&gt; |
&gt; | (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary Book1)
&gt; |      (and (gives x)
&gt; |           (giver John)
&gt; |           (receiver Mary)
&gt; |           (given book1)
&gt; |      )
&gt; | )
