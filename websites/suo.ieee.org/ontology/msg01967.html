&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; First, the model theory which Chris invented for KIF has,
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost as a side-effect, the possibility of distinguishing
&gt; &gt; &gt; between relations (the individual things which relation symbols
&gt; &gt; &gt; denote) and relational extensions.  To emphasise:  it does not
&gt; &gt; &gt; *require* that these be distiguished, but it does allow for this
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a possibility.  Since this is therefore built into the language,
&gt; &gt; &gt; as it were, we do have Leibnitz' option available to us.  However,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the identification of 'class' with 'set' is slightly more debateable.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think we are all agreed that classes are sets, ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is just the opposite of what I am used to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; but to assert the identity of the two ideas would
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to imply that all sets are classes, ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "All sets are classes" is exactly what
&gt; &gt; most "logic and maths people" (LAMP's)
&gt; &gt; whom I have ever known would say.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, we are getting our communication wires crossed by a pun
&gt; on "class".  Mathematicians use the word in a very particular way,
&gt; which in its full form is written "proper class", to refer to things
&gt; that anyone but a mathematican (and even some of them) would call a set,
&gt; except they are so big that if they are accepted into the set-theoretic
&gt; universe they would give rise to paradoxes.  In the wider word, however,
&gt; the term "class" is used in a sense which is closely linked to "classification",
&gt; to refer to (the extension of) a named category in some kind of classification
&gt; heirarchy.  Such classes all have sets as their extension (or, maybe, ARE sets),
&gt; but not every set would normally be dignified with the title of 'class(ification)'

Hey, I'm just the messenger.  This is set theory as she is spoke.
You will be misunderstood by anybody who has had even one course
in set theory.  But I suppose that you guys like to be surprised.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and this usage would conflict with most usages of 'class' in
&gt; &gt; &gt; modern ontological usage.  (Another related word is 'sort').
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suspect there is no real hope of having this peculiar
&gt; &gt; usage extend to the broader technical community.
&gt; 
&gt; Im afraid that this sense of 'class' has already been
&gt; in widespread use throughout at least one of the broader
&gt; technical ontology communities for about a decade now.

Ten years?  Ten years!  What is that in the Cosmic Scheme of things!?
Having spent my time in the field of psychology, I am well aware of
this "decadent" perspective on the world, and the 5-10 yr window on
the literature that they have.  I have also run into this class of
folks who are so busy weaving their web thesauri around our necks
that they never seem to have the time to actually consult one --
maybe John Sowa can educate them, not I -- as Frank Lloyd Wright
said, "Experts don't have to think, they know."  Hey, we all make
mistakes -- I am the expert at that -- but I do not understand this
pride that some people have in their ignorance.  People cannot just
go about making up arbitrary definitions for stuff like "aggregate",
"class", "composite", "concept", "extension", "genus", "hypostasis",
"intension", "kind", "reification", "relation", "set", "species",
just to mention a few of the novelties that I have heard in the
last six months, without expecting a little trouble.  But when
you tell them the history of the words, they act like they are
outside of history or something.

&gt; Check out the literature on description logics and
&gt; such ontological 'standards' as LOOM and CLASSIC.

Wait a minute ...
Wait a minute ...
Aren't you the one who is suspicious of "standards"?

&gt; &gt; &gt; So what we have agreed to do is to institutionalize a kind
&gt; &gt; &gt; of official agnosticism.  There are three ways of talking:
&gt; &gt; &gt; in terms of classes and instances;  properties and individuals;
&gt; &gt; &gt; or about sorts and individuals.  These ways of talking are
&gt; &gt; &gt; intertranslateable.  Classes, sorts and properties are all
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar in that they all have associated extensions which
&gt; &gt; &gt; are 'pure' sets; ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will assume here that "pure sets" are what non-modern non-ontologists
&gt; &gt; call "classes", and try to read on with that in mind.  Let me know ...
&gt; 
&gt; Not proper classes.  Put aside the mathematical usage of "set/class"
&gt; terminology for now.  I was using the admittedly odd term "'pure' set"
&gt; (perhaps "set simpliciter" would have been better) just to mean 'set';
&gt; it seemed to require some terminological decoration since many folk
&gt; identify "set" with "class" in any case.  Your term "LAMP set"
&gt; will do fine.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and many of the things that are said about them are rendered
&gt; &gt; &gt; true or false by criteria which depend only on their extensions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That would put them in a class with sets and classes,
&gt; &gt; whose names will always suggest a bearing of extension,
&gt; &gt; however succesfully or not this bearing is borne out.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I agree.  All of these notions have a bearing of extension,
&gt; in your elegant phrase.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, whether or not they ARE their extensions
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot, strictly, even be posed as a question, ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These are still the "pure sets" (what LAMP's call "classes")?
&gt; &gt; They begin to sound much less pure and more like intensions.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I try to use the word "set" only in its pure mathematical sense.
&gt; Being a LAMP, sets are something I understand.  The rest is somewhat
&gt; murky. I will use "set" only in the LAMP sense, or still more sharply
&gt; in the FOMP sense. (However, to emphasise, I am *not* using "class"
&gt; in the LAMP or FOMP sense.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems like it would be a good idea, if you wish explicitly
&gt; &gt; to set aside or to defer the bearing of any extension, to give
&gt; &gt; them a name that advises the reader of that, say, "intensions".
&gt; 
&gt; Had I so wished, I would indeed have tried to be careful
&gt; in the way you suggest.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the truthvalues of any KIF expression will be unchanged
&gt; &gt; &gt; if we insist that they always are, or if we insist that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; never are, or if we take some intermediate position.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone whose philosophical tastes run in one or the other direction
&gt; &gt; &gt; is free to impose their tastes on the semantic theory, and then the
&gt; &gt; &gt; logic will 'work' within those tastes perfectly well.  For example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; if someone wanted to say that properties are not identical to their
&gt; &gt; &gt; extension, but that classes are, ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have trouble understanding this.  I am used to saying
&gt; &gt; that a set (a LAMP set) is "determined by" its extension,
&gt; &gt; but never that a set is "identical to" its extension.
&gt; 
&gt; For the first time in this message you leave me confused.  In what way
&gt; does a set (a LAMP set) differ from its extension?  Certainly any set
&gt; described by ZF set theory is identical to its extension.  The extension
&gt; of a set S is the set of members of S, and that must be S by the axiom of
&gt; extensionality.

One of the ways that the word "extension" has always
been used is to speak of the "extension of a term" or
the "extension of a concept" (concept = mental term).
It is usually acknowledged that one can do this without
invoking the extraneous existence of another entity like
a class, a collection, a set, or what have you, that the
term or the concept itself already does the job that one
might want the objectively existing extra entity for --
these are radically nominal thinkers who say this stuff,
but it is one of the varieties of minimalism that even
Russell sought in the form of his "No Class" theory.

So the extension of a term or concept is not a set --
they do not admit the existence of such a thing --
it is just all of the individual extendees.
It is just the way that these people talk!

One way to rationalize this talk is to say that we actually mispeak
ourselves whenever we speak of "the extension" as a substantive noun,
that we have thereby reified what is really a relation, "extension of",
and thus created the illusion of a fictitious hypostatic otiose entity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; could indeed say that without fear of contradiction;
&gt; &gt; &gt; they would be obliged, of course, to understand the
&gt; &gt; &gt; translation of class-language into property-language
&gt; &gt; &gt; as one which translates extensions into intensions.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; To extensionalists such as myself and Matthew, all of these are sets:
&gt; &gt; &gt; some sets are called classes, some classes are called properties, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; some properties are called sorts, but they are all just sets.  But it
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems that this kind of robust non-nonsense extensionalism is not in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the forefront of fashion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have never even heard of it until now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since these issues of philosphical stance and terminology are among
&gt; &gt; &gt; the most contentious and also the ones that make the least difference
&gt; &gt; &gt; to anyone other than philosophers, the fact that KIF is in effect
&gt; &gt; &gt; provably neutral on them has several advantages.  In particular,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it allows people to cooperate, and it puts the fact that these
&gt; &gt; &gt; quarrels are really about nothing of any practical importance
&gt; &gt; &gt; into sharp relief.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am beginning to suspect that some Malcontented Cartesian Demon
&gt; &gt; has transposed all of the appearances of "set" and "class" in
&gt; &gt; your text before sending it on to me.  Let me know, that is,
&gt; &gt; if you can find a secure channel of communication.
&gt; 
&gt; Do not read "class" as meaning "proper class" in the
&gt; mathematical sense, but rather as "classification".

This sounds like "natural kinds" talk.  Is that it?
At any rate, it's not a matter of getting just me or
a couple hundred other folks to experiment with your
novelties.  We are flexible.  Others are less so.

&gt; I don't have an exact definition of a "class" in this sense, and
&gt; I doubt if there is one;  nevertheless the term is in widespread
&gt; usage. It seems to correspond roughly to "natural kind", which
&gt; also has no usabel definition.  Examples of classes might be:
&gt; Human, Animal, Abstract, ... but sets such as the one
&gt; that contains even integers, the Eiffel tower and my
&gt; aunties would not normally be called "classes".

If you want to talk about something that is morally equivalent to
or pragmatically indistinguishable from natural kinds, then I think
it would help to use that term, which many more people use that way.
If you want to read some of the best ideas I know on approaching the
problem of natural kinds, I will natually be so kind as to suggest
a chapter of Peirce, his work on "A Limited Universe of Marks".
