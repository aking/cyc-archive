Dear Pat C,

I'm afraid I take life to be very simple: If it's abstract, then its a class
(including relations if that's relevant).

See below for some commentary.

Regards

&gt; Subject: Re: SUO: Proposed Changes to Merged Ontology - abstractness
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      I believe that Ian Niles's summary of several  
&gt; approaches to an SUO is a
&gt; valuable contribution to this discussion.
&gt;      I would like at this point to comment on just one part 
&gt; of this thread, and I
&gt; am not
&gt; sure if I am in agreement with Pat Hayes on this point, 
&gt; specifically the
&gt; question of whether there should be an "abstract object" 
&gt; category at the highest
&gt; level of the SUO.  I believe it is a serious mistake, at 
&gt; least insofar as it
&gt; inhibits
&gt; expressiveness of an SUO,  to create a high-level category of 
&gt; "abstract objects"
&gt; or "abstract
&gt; entities" for which the property of "abstractness" is inheritable.

MW: I agree, but that is principally because I see abstract object and class
as synonyms, so you don't need both.

&gt;     What this does is to prohibit a user from ever 
&gt; considering a non-physical
&gt; concept as
&gt; being an "abstraction" of a physical object and therefore a 
&gt; parent or more remote
&gt; ancestor on
&gt; an inheritance chain.  Although the high-level binary distinction of
&gt; abstract/concrete is
&gt; common in general ontologies, it flies directly in the face 
&gt; of the menage of
&gt; abstraction, which is to
&gt; create a more general concept by taking away some attribute 
&gt; from a more specific
&gt; concept.

MW: When you start of with a class, what you get from this is
subclass/superclass relations. When you start from something physical and
take away some attributes (quite literally it doesn't have them, not that
they are unknown) then you get a class, of which the original object is at
least one member.

&gt; It also ignores the cognitive process by which abstract 
&gt; concepts are formed, i.e.
&gt; by generalization,
&gt; typically by abstraction of certain common attributes from 
&gt; some physical objects,
&gt; properties,
&gt; or processes.
&gt;     It is understandable that when one thinks of mathematical 
&gt; objects as being
&gt; abstract, one can
&gt; probably agree that all descendents of mathematical objects 
&gt; will also be
&gt; abstract.  But this
&gt; is only one kind of object commonly thought of as "abstract". 
&gt;  There are many
&gt; physical
&gt; objects and processes for which one can easily produce a 
&gt; non-physical (and
&gt; therefore
&gt; "abstract") analogous concept by simply removing the 
&gt; attributes which make the
&gt; object
&gt; physical, such as mass for objects or physical time as the 
&gt; co-ordinate of change
&gt; (or "progress")
&gt; in a process.   Mental objects and processes are also often 
&gt; thought of as
&gt; abstract, but are
&gt; typically intimately associated with physical processes.

MW: I agree, also states, and their classes "She was in an emotional state".

&gt;      I believe that at the highest level, we need to be able 
&gt; to create classes of
&gt; objects and
&gt; processes which are not themselves physical, but can be 
&gt; considered as ancestral to
&gt; 
&gt; physical objects and processes.  

MW: I'm not quite sure what you are saying here. What I would want to say is
that you should be able to create classes of which physical objects were
members. Is that what you mean?

&gt; In this view, an "abstract' 
&gt; object is simply one
&gt; that is
&gt; not "physical", i.e. if it is an object, it must not have 
&gt; mass, and if it is a
&gt; process or
&gt; event, it must not involve physical objects nor be located in 
&gt; space-time.  The
&gt; absence of
&gt; the property "physical" is what I think of as defining an 
&gt; "abstract" concept , but
&gt; the
&gt; absence of an attribute need not be an inheritable property in itself.

MW: And this works fine if you see this as a class/member relationship.

&gt;     In this way, the existence of objects, like 
&gt; information-bearing objects, with
&gt; both
&gt; physical and abstract characteristics, will not be 
&gt; problematical, as they can
&gt; inherit
&gt; characteristics from both physical and non-physical lines in 
&gt; an ontology.

MW: The way I (well we EPISTLE really) deal with this is by having the
physical object, say a piece of paper with ink on it, and a "class of
information representation" (sorry its a bit of a mouthful - just read
information, but it is a class) which is the pattern that is common to that
piece of paper and all copies of it.

&gt;     Although the public CYC (I do not have access to other 
&gt; parts of CYC) has the
&gt; class of "#$CompositeTangibleAndIntangibleObject", it also 
&gt; seems to include a
&gt; notion
&gt; of inheritable abstractness (the concept "#$Intangible" and 
&gt; its descendants).  

MW: I'd be interested in some examples of instances of these things. One of
the few things the EPISTLE Core Model does not allow is for a thing to be
more than one of an individual (spatio-temporal extent), a class, or a
relationship (instance of a relation).

&gt; I
&gt; think
&gt; this is what led to the creation of  the classes 
&gt; #$PartiallyTangible and
&gt; #$PartiallyIntangible,
&gt; and though I have tried to determine what utility such 
&gt; distinctions have, I have
&gt; not found
&gt; in the public CYC any evidence that these categories are 
&gt; themselves useful in
&gt; reasoning.
&gt; (The notion of an information-bearing object is, however, 
&gt; probably quite useful).

MW: Yes, but it is an incidental not necessary class (in 3D speak).

&gt; I conclude
&gt; that these classes are probably kludgey and inefficient ways 
&gt; to avoid the problems
&gt; created by
&gt; not allowing non-physical concepts to be ancestors (more 
&gt; abstract versions) of
&gt; physical concepts.

MW: I agree, see above for my analysis.

&gt;     I regret that for over a month my time has been totally 
&gt; occupied in other
&gt; tasks, and I have
&gt; not had the opportunity to formulate these ideas within a 
&gt; consistent set of
&gt; higher-level
&gt; concepts in KIF format, as has been done by Ian Niles, but I 
&gt; hope to be able to do
&gt; some
&gt; of that within a few weeks.
