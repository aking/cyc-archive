Everyone,

I have not been following the details of the triadicity discussion, but I was
delighted to see Pat Hayes' detailed explication of it. I'm guessing that it is
to a significant extent, a condensed and synthesized view of this thread so
far.  When this issue dies down, and there is reasonable agreement on things,
including what to disagree on, then it would be possible to record this as an
'official' outcome of the SUO group.

I propose that a kind of SUO bookshelf be set up on our web pages. It would
contain detailed technical summaries similar to what Pat has produced. This
would be an 

     EFFECTIVE VEHICLE FOR DISSEMINATION OF THE  
     SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE ON MANY FRONTS, 

which to date is virtually inaccessible, buried in the discussion archives.
One can think of this as real-time knowledge mining of our archives.
This would affect many folk:

1. The world at large can see our progress to date.
2. Newcomers can much more easily get up to speed.
3. Regulars can skip the details and be assured of a good summary, in time.
4. All participants can be more efficient in the time they spend reading SUO,
   being able to keep up to speed on things on their own time, without fear 
   of missing key information.

Personally, I have on many occasions been on the verge of getting off this list
because it is overwhelming. Yet, there are MANY things that are of great
interest and relevance to me, which I lack the time to follow and contribute in
detail to.  A kind of SUO bookshelf, I hope would make everyone make more
efficient use of their SUO-time.

I propose the following process/format for how this might happen.

1. Discussion threads take place in the usual fashion. 

2. When things settle down a bit, and points of agreement are reached, these
should be summarized and fed back to the group. This would also include points
where people agree to disagree.

3. When the main participants in the discussion reach agreement on the
summary, then it could be submitted to the overall group for placement
on the 'bookshelf'.   The assumption is that things DO go on the bookshelf.
I don't think we want a formal voting process for this. The idea of going to
the group at large, is to see if there are any further suggestions or
improvements to the document. 

4. We announce the existence of each new entry to the bookshelf to a SUO
interest group which is only intersted in the outcomes and timely announements,
rather than the day to day discussions.  We may already have such list, I do
not know whether the creation of SUO sub-lists some months ago, actually
worked.

I would hope or expect that in many cases, these summaries could be the basis
for quality technical papers that are publishable.  

Can we submit a journal arcitle with SUO as author? :-)

I know I said I wouldnt say any more on this topic here, but several 
people have asked me for the review I mentioned, so here is a brief 
summary of the pith and essence, shorn of references to Burch's 
formalism and terminology.

On irreducible triadicity.

There are three distinct domains to consider. The first is a purely 
mathematical notion of a connected graph; the second is formal 
relational languages; and the third, somewhat murkier, is concerned 
with the metaphysical nature of relations. Peirce proved a simple 
result in graph theory to which he and others attribute metaphysical 
significance; but it does so only if one chooses a particular 
connection between the first and third of our domains via the second. 
Other connections are possible, under which the result, while of 
course still true, seems to have much less significance.

The result in graph theory is, roughly, that any connected graph can 
be built using nodes of degree 1,2 and 3, but that one cannot do it 
with nodes only of degree 1 and 2.  (Degree of a node is the number 
of arcs connected to it.) More precisely, it is that every connected 
graph can be 'expanded' to a graph built using such nodes, where one 
expands a graph by replacing some of its nodes by connected subgraphs 
whose external arcs are isomorphic to the arcs to that node in the 
first graph. In effect, the expanded graph has a subgraph which can 
be collapsed (by identifying all its nodes and any connections 
between them) into a single node of the original graph. In modern 
terms one might say that the expanded graph is an implementation of 
the first graph in which some nodes are implemented by datastructures 
which are themselves connected graphs: imagine using LISP to encode a 
graph, for example.

It is easy to see how to construct such a datastructure for any node 
of degree n &gt;3; one simply takes n-2  degree-3 nodes and links them 
together in a chain: (view the following in a fixed-width font)

     |      |      |      |           |
  ---1------2------3------4---....---n-2---

which has n outgoing arcs to which the nodes linked to the original 
node can be attached. Also it is pretty obvious that you couldn't do 
it with nodes of degree 2, since the process of linking them together 
would itself use up all but the two spare 'ends', so you can only get 
another degree-2 graph.

That is the sum total of the notion of 'irreducible triadicity'. It 
is an interesting result in graph theory, but why is it considered to 
have any deep importance in semantics and semiotics? To see why 
Peirce thought it did, one has to appreciate how Peirce would have 
interpreted a semantic network.

A semantic network is a way of interpreting labelled graphs as sets 
of assertions: the nodes of the graph correspond to things, and the 
arcs of the graph correspond to relations. Only binary relations can 
be directly accomodated in this way, so to encode the fact that a 
relation R of greater arity (eg a trinary relation) holds, one 
introduces a new node to be an 'R-fact', and links it to the 
arguments of the trinary relation by arcs (which can be labelled with 
relations like 'first', 'second', etc., if no intuitively sensible 
relation names suggest themselves.) This corresponds to the logic 
translation I gave in an earlier message, and it has been widely used 
in KR work for many years.  (To give a full translation of FOL into 
graphs requires other devices, including some way to represent 
quantifier scope. John Sowa's CG's are an excellent example; I will 
ignore this from now on as it is orthogonal to the 'triadicity' 
issue.)

With this encoding of relational language into graphs, the 
irreducible triadicity result is not important, since the degree of a 
node plays no special role in the interpretation (it corresponds to 
the number of times a name is used in a logical expression). Peirce 
however had a rather different way of interpreting such a graph. In 
Peirce's graphical notation, the nodes of the graph, not the arcs, 
are thought of as indicating relations, so that the degree of the 
node is the number of arguments the relation has. With this 
interpretation the degree of a node is clearly of much greater 
importance, and the graph-theoretic result takes on a new 
significance. It is therefore interesting to investigate this other 
'Peircian' way of interpreting of a graph.

One might object immediately that if the nodes are relations, what 
part of the graph indicates the things the relations hold between, ie 
the things related by the relations? This question gets to the heart 
of the Peirce/Whitehead notion of the world being in some sense made 
of process, rather than things; 'things' are thought of here as a 
kind of convenient illusion (one which arises, in fact, from noticing 
relations.) The relations are seen as the the metaphysical ground on 
which the notion of individual is itself built. I do not want here to 
get involved in this metaphysical discussion, but will just remark 
that it is completely divorced from what might be called the 
intellectual mainstream of the last century, in which mathematics and 
formal semantics have been based on set theory, which in turn is 
rooted in the idea of collecting together things, a notion which 
depends on the idea of one individual thing being distinct from 
another. I mention all this only to partly motivate what would 
otherwise seem to be a very odd answer to the question about what in 
the the graph denotes the individuals, which is Peirce's answer: 
nothing. There are no individuals being related; there are only 
relations. The basic 'connection' between relations expressed by the 
arcs in the graph is now rather mysterious, but it can be thought of 
as a kind of existential connection: it says that the two relations 
share a kind of factual bonding at this point; they are mutually 
instantiated. In modern terms one would write this as an explicit 
existential claim using a quantifier:
(exists x)(R1(...x...) &amp; R2(.....x...))
where the dots indicate that the other arguments are filled in with 
other, different, variables.
The quantifier is not really needed, and one can just use 'anonymous' 
names of free variables:
R1(...x...) &amp; R2(.....x...)
  This is what an arc in the graph translates into in Peirce's view of 
graphs as assertions. Notice that this is an exact dual of the 
semantic network view of the graph: here, the arcs are the 'things' 
and the nodes are the relations.

If one thinks of relations as atoms, then this bonding is rather like 
chemical valency, and the connected graphs which result are analogous 
to molecules; and logic becomes a kind of relational chemistry. This 
metaphor is superficially attractive, and in particular it has the 
merit, if one feels that these 'things' are best kept out of sight, 
of disposing of the connections as real things in themselves.

This view of what a graph means, however, has some limitations. 
Notice that in the translation into logic sketched above, it is 
possible to use any variable (or individual name) at most twice, 
corresponding to the two ends of the arc in the graph.  This produces 
a curiously attenuated logic, in which for example it is not possible 
to say that something has three properties:
P(x) &amp; Q(x) &amp; R(x)
has no Peircian graph corresponding to it (it would need an arc with 
three ends). To overcome this, Peirce introduces a special class of 
relations, called identity relations. Then the graph which would say 
that this P-Q-R-ish thing existed would have the following 
translation:
P(x) &amp; Q(y) &amp; R(z) &amp; I3(x, y, z)  (notice each variable is only in 2 places)
where I3 is the special relation of three-way identity, which Peirce 
called 'teridentity'. The graph looks like this:

                P
                |
                |
          R----I3 ----Q

There can be such special relations I-n for all finite n, but in fact 
we only need I3, since the others can be 'implemented' using I3 in 
the way outlined at the beginning, by chaining enough (n-2) I3's 
together. Using a modern translation, for example, I5 can be defined 
as

I5(x y z u v)  &lt;==&gt;  I3(x y A) &amp; I3(A z B) &amp; I3(B u v)

where the A and B links are 'private' to this little subgraph. Peirce 
attributed great significance to the identity relations, as well he 
might, since once they are put in place they clearly play the role of 
individuals. To assert a relation of identity is to say that 
something exists, and linking the identity to other relations says 
that they hold of thing that exists.

The above reduction-to-I3 trick doesnt work if you try to use just 
I2, ie good old equals. You might think that it would be easy, since 
it is easy to write it in modern logic:
I3(x y z) &lt;==&gt; (x=y) &amp; (y=z)
but if you now try to use this rewrite, the 'y' has been used up 
since it occurs twice in the definition already - no name can be used 
more than twice -  so you can't say that anything else equals y; so 
this is really just I2(x,z). The two-ended nature of graph arcs has 
got you cornered.  Triadicity really is irreducible in Peircian graph 
language.

Notice that the only triadic relation we really need is I3 itself, 
since we can string together a suitable implementation for any n-ary 
node using copies of I3, and even string an extra link to a node 
which holds the label of the original node as well, and use binary or 
unary relations for everything else; so any claim that some 
*particular* relation (other than I3) is itself irreducibly triadic 
must be based on some other criterion.

The interest of this irreducibility, however, is relative to how 
seriously one views the metaphysical consequences of the Peircian 
interpretation of graphs. I suggest that it isn't of much interest 
(other than historical), for several reasons. First, there's an 
obviously better interpretation available (semantic networks.) 
Second, the triadicity result applies to graphs, but it doesnt apply 
to a simple generalization which is just as mathematically 
respectable, if harder to draw, and which provides a more natural 
structure to interpret in the Peircian fashion. Hypergraphs are 
graphs where an arc (called a hyperarc) can link more than two nodes. 
These have a very direct Peircian-style interpretation which doesnt 
require the rather artificial 'identity relation' nodes; but 
triadicity is reducible in hypergraphs. Third, if one asks what the 
'identity relation' really is saying, it is clear that it amounts to 
what would be expressed in modern terms as an existential assertion, 
ie it says that some THING exists; and if we can refer to that thing, 
it is obvious that any n-fold identity can be expressed as a 
conjunction of binary equality statements. The irreducibility of 
triadicity arises from a curiously obtuse combination of insisting 
that existence can be expressed by using an identity relation, and 
refusing to allow any way of referring to the thing that exists.
