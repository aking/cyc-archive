Phil,

I have the title of this essay to reflect what I see
as the overlying difficulty of the underlying issues.

Philip Jackson wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; I have changed the subject of this email thread
&gt; to note that it is about a specific subtopic,
&gt; the role of semiotics in SUO, while my original
&gt; email thread was about more general topics,
&gt; i.e. the need for requirements specifications,
&gt; requirements traceability, etc. in SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; To summarize your message, there seem to be
&gt; at least the following alternative perspectives:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) semiotic concepts have no place in SUO,
&gt;    since ontologies are supposed to be about
&gt;    things that exist,

Notice what you just said, by way of stating this POV:

"ontologies are supposed to be about things that exist"

You have just told me what (you believe)
an ontology is "supposed" to be "about" --
you have not told me what an ontology is --
unless what it is reduces to the question
of what it is "supposed" to be "about".
Is that not an interesting observation?

Two questions almost immediately come to mind:

1.  "Supposed" by whom?  Unlike some folks,
    I do not have faith in disembodied POV's,
    so this is a question as to the implicit
    interpreters, the agents or the community,
    that are the bearers of this "supposition".

2.  What other sorts of things are defined by
    "what" they are "about", plus, perhaps,
    "how" they go "about" being "about" it?
    To spare you the suspense, those of us who
    did not discover the importance of signs
    suddenly last summer have been used to
    calling such things "sign relations".

    In this case, an "ontology", which,
    like its name SCREAMS out that it IS,
    to use that extra "UMPH" that appears
    hereabouts to be sufficient to deliver
    an embryonic sign into that status of
    being an honest-to-God -- and HE always
    knows who HE IS -- indicator of BEING,
    well, this onto+logy is neither being
    by itself nor signs by themselves, but,
    like its just keeps on hinting, a thing
    about relationships among sign-things
    and their object-things.  In short,
    an ontology is a sign relation, and
    so now I, at least, have just told
    you, perhaps for the first time in
    your hearing, what an ontology IS.

&gt; while semiotics is about signs for things that exist.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) signs are things, and so semiotic concepts could be included
&gt;    in an ontology, as "yet another subject matter" of the ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) a theory of signs is fundamental to logic and to the language
&gt;    for the ontology.  So the language, and perhaps the ontology
&gt;    also, needs to be developed based on a theory of signs.

A theory of anything, a thinking about anything, takes place
in the context of a sign relation.  If you want your theory
about anything, your thinking about anything, to be any good,
then you need to correct it when it goes wrong in relation to
the target world outside that theory, that conduit of thought --
unless, of couse, you imagine that it is already perfect, which
more people do in their "heart of hearts" (HOH) than would easily
fess up tuit.  And in order to correct it you will need to be able
to reflect on it, and so it goes.  What's that signpost up ahead!?
You are already in the thick o fit -- there is no escape from signs.

&gt; The first two perspectives may easily be
&gt; translated to a requirements question:
&gt;
&gt; Should signs (and related concepts) be included in
&gt; or excluded from the ontology?

What you just asked was, substituting equals for equals
in what I trust is not a "referentially opaque" context:

&gt; Should "logos" (and related concepts) be included in
&gt; or excluded from the "ontology"?

Again, the experience of pure "Ontos" is what they
teach down the hall and on the left, in Zen 101 --
What we are aiming for here is "Logos of Ontos",
an "effable" theory, hopefully, apparently all too
naively hopefully, a "critically reflective" theory.

Peirce scholar Mary Keeler has this phrase about a "Veil Of Transparency".
I am not sure, but I think that it has to do with this insistent illusion
that we somehow have this direct, ummediated intuition of Ontos, of Being,
of the way that things really ARE, and all that it takes is the spiritual
technique of a few capital letters to jog our minds back into the transit
of "purely apprehending being like universal minds" (PABLUM), or sumthing.

&gt; Can the third perspective be phrased in terms
&gt; of concise, well-defined requirements for
&gt; either the ontology or its language?

Echo that:

"either the ontology OR its logy?"
A phraseo-logy worthy of Kafka or Kierkegaard!

Someone has to listen when you talk --
Why does it have to be only me!?

Let me return the question in this fashion:

Can any POV that does 'not' do this be rendered internally coherent?

&gt; If so, what are these proposed requirements?
&gt; This is a question which everyone can address
&gt; as they choose, of course ...
&gt; 
&gt; One answer to this question might be that KIF is already
&gt; adequately based on a theory of signs, since there is
&gt; a mapping between KIF and Conceptual Graphs, which
&gt; are based largely on Peirce's existential graphs.
&gt; It would be interesting to hear some specific
&gt; thoughts pro or con this point of view.

Peirce's Logics, Graphical or Otherwise,
are embedded in his Theory of Signs,
which is a more general, primitive,
rudimentary, sauvage study --

But I am repeating myself ...

Someone has to listen when I talk --
Why does it have to be only me!?

It would be interesting if you 'could' hear ...
The specific thoughts that I already stated ...
Then, we could begin to have a conversation ...

Gotta Go Do Something Else ...

Jon Awbrey

P.S.

If you get the feeling that I am expressing here
the accumulated exasperations of a longer period
of time than that which I took to read your note,
well, you guess correctly.  --  Sorry 'bout that!

J.A.
