I think that this may be a good time to pause from
my labor of mopping up the basement floor of logic,
to say why the "irreducibility of triadics" (IOT)
is justly an issue that is so all-fired important
to me.  I will try to say this more clearly than
I have before, but I do not expect to succeed on
the first pass, so please bear with me if you can.

Awbrey &amp; Awbrey have spent the last dozen years or so
brainstorming and reflecting and writing on this very
problematic, and so I am thoroughly aware that it is
no light matter -- the opposite of dark matter? --
to get the hang of, to catch the drift of right out
of the chutes -- durned ole rodeo that it is! --
and so I believe that I ought to apologize for
my oftimes lack of patience in this regard,
but it is merely my earnest desire to see
some  bit of advance on this score while
I still have the chance to do something
about it.  By the way, given that Sue
demands artistic control -- I do not
know why! -- over our joint works,
I can heartily and still humbly
recommend these two papers of
ours to you on the subject:

<A  HREF="http://www.chss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html">http://www.chss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html</A>
<A  HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/integrat.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/integrat.htm</A>

The "Creating Integrative Universities" paper comes mainly
out of Sue's research and application areas, but afforded
me a chance to fold in some of my favorite Peircean themes.
We gave it at a "Re-Organizing Knowledge" (ROK) Conference
in Amherst in 1999 that quickly opened my eyes to the fact
that a whole lot of people out there are really beginning
to get this stuff and to try to follow up its educational
ramifications and its social repercussions.  Gives me hope.

<A  HREF="http://www.som.umass.edu/som/resource/projects/conference">http://www.som.umass.edu/som/resource/projects/conference</A>

A "new and improved" version of this paper will soon appear in the journal
'Organization: Interdisciplinary Journal of Organization, Theory, &amp; Society',
in a special issue dedicated to selected papers from the ROK Conference:

<A  HREF="http://www.som.umass.edu/som/pub/organization">http://www.som.umass.edu/som/pub/organization</A>

But I am already beginning to digress ...

So let me start once again and try to say, more specifically,
aside from the psyche-pompous circumstance that the survival
of our species, if not the vivacity of our humanity -- and,
yes, I know the difference -- depends on its acknowledgement,
why the IOT is important to the several specialized communities
that I have been wont to harangue with it over the past few months.

Its significance to Peircean pragmaticians I need not elaborate here.
To those whose appreciate the complexity and subtlety of natural or
human phenomena and who seek to convey a measure of their respects
to the cultures, social and scientific, in which they play a part,
I need only suggest that triadic relations capture a good portion
of the generative power, as models of phenomena, that Nature, the
nature of ourselves, and all of the artifices that we overlay on
these twin basal metabolies of symbiotic and symbolic germ layers,
can afford us.  To validate that suggestion may take more or less
allusion, demonstration, exemplification, and illustration, but it
will not in the very offing be regarded with suspicion by their ilk.

So the nub of my task is to explain to the Ontological Community
why triadicity matters to them, whether all of them know it yet
or not, and why I am so adamant about the fact that their aims
cannot be fulfilled unless they meet the associated obstacles
head on.  But now it is time for me to catch my breath, and
so I will return to this duty anon.

Jon Awbrey
