JA, quoting RD:

    | But if we are to select those dimensions which will be
    | of the greatest assistance to our imagination, we should
    | never attend to more than one or two of them as depicted in
    | our imagination, even though we are well aware that there is
    | an indefinite number involved in the problem at issue.  It is
    | part of the method to distinguish as many dimensions as possible,
    | so that, while attending to as few as possible at the same time,
    | we nevertheless proceed to take in all of them one by one.
    |

HP: I've lost the context in which Jon presents this quote, ...

Sorry -- that's probably because I omitted
to copy the anchor of this skein to OCA.
Let this be my belated amends:

Subj:  Any PORT In A Storm?
Date:  Mon, 17 Sep 2001 11:01:11 -0400
From:  Jon Awbrey &lt;jawbrey@oakland.edu&gt;
  To:  Peirce Online Resource Testbed &lt;PORT-L@LISTSERV.IUPUI.EDU&gt;

Mary Keeler, Jack Park, John Sowa wrote some stuff
that made me think about some other stuff ...

Maybe folks hereabouts are ready to start talking about this -- should I risk it? --
I know I've been fooled so many times before, but when did that ever stop me?

Okay, from the top ...

There are some themes from Peirce that have serious practical consequences
for how we &quot;oughta&quot; go about building and mediating our next try at a true
tele-community of inquiry.  But the answers to these problematic themes are
not easy answers, so far as I can tell from thirty very odd years of trying
to think about them, and they are not the sorts of knee-jerk popular answers
with which all the web-wise-world that just discovered semantics and semiotics
semes to be rife, all too ripe right now.  Pretty harsh words, I know, enough to
turn anybody off right from the start, but I don't care, better that than to waste
more time with the sort of folk who won't face up to the real problems.  So I will
make the eternally hopeful assumption that this is not that sort of group and go on
from there.

Over the past couple of years on the net I have come to give these &quot;themes from Peirce&quot;
a variety of different niche-names, acronymic and otherwise.  Here is a current sample:

1.  Aristotle's Approximation and Descartes Factorization of the Sign Relation,
    together also known as the &quot;Triviality Of Integration&quot; (TOI) hypothesis,
    and just how much of what we do today still tries to operate within it,
    for all that some of us are supposed to know about irreducible triadics.

2.  &quot;Encapsulation Versus Entanglement&quot; (EVE).
    The &quot;irreducubility of triadics&quot; appears to pose some tough obstructions
    to making modules of everything that we might naturally like to so reduce.

3.  &quot;Yet Another Representation Without A Reasoning System&quot; (YARWARS).

4.  &quot;Analysis Precedes Inference&quot; (API).

5.  Integration of Declarative and Functional Aspects of Logical Representations.
    This involves a certain degree of formal flexibility in pragmatic hermeneutics
    that allows us to regard assertoric and reflective treatments of propositions
    as &quot;interpretive factors&quot;, or as perspectival attitudes toward propositions,
    rather than having to be features that are stamped into the syntax itself.

These topics are all related to each other and to central themes of Peirce's philosophy.
I will gather some of the remarks that I have made about them over the last two years.

HP: I've lost the context in which Jon presents this quote, but my reaction was that
    this &quot;one at a time&quot; sequential semiotics is indeed what characterizes most logical,
    mathematical, and structurally programmed computational operations (productions,
    rewrite rules, state transitions, etc.).  Even natural language, speech and text
    production, and transmission first appears as a &quot;one at a time&quot; focal sequence.

Well, RD's remarks are pitched at a different level of interest than the brain proper --
remember, his subject line read as &quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot;.  This means
that we are talking about the control interface of the physical component in question,
and we should not confound the conscious mind, over which we appear to have or imagine
ourslves to have a measure of voluntary control, with the underlying brain, over which
we have none, at least, not in any direct sense that we would know how best to exercise.
What is a control interface?  Well, I am looking at one now.  I know that the siliconic
underpinions of my computer do not literally embody any flinty arrowheads or tiny hands,
beweißhandschuhlich or otherwise, but I accept their apparitions before my eyes as the
adequate apparatus that they appear to be.  So we are talking about GUI not glia here.

The point of this series of examples will be to examine such &quot;rules of direction&quot;,
the brands of approximal truths and heuristic principles that the lion's share of
us have become accustomed to using all of the time in our practical business of
inquiry, whether or not we have ever taken the time to reflect on why we think
that way or how we got into the habit of acting in accord with these maxims.
And the implicit question, that I will strive to make more explicit as time
goes by, will be:  &quot;Do we really want to keep on taking this for granted?&quot;

HP: But we know that the brain does not work this way.
    Its linear sequential output is only the external
    (one might even say superficial) manifestation
    of highly parallel, distributed dynamics of the
    &quot;enchanted loom&quot; whose millions of neurons in
    the &quot;creative frame of mind&quot; can &quot;taketh all
    things into account&quot; concurrently.  Only by
    focal concentration on routine, excluding all
    creative acts, can we balance our checkbooks.
    These are complementary modes of brain function,
    and there must be other modes in between.

Okay, you are certainly not the first person I ever met
who says that they know how the brain works -- I will
just get it off my chest right now and confess that
I do not have a clue.  Whew!  What a relief ...
Not that it isn't fun to speculate, though ...
