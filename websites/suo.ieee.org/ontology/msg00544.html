Hi All,

	Here is my response to Chris Partridge's claim that the "Merged
Ontology" is not "sufficiently conceptually consistent" and does not have a
"practical purpose".  First of all, I'm sure that there are cases of
inconsistency in the latest version of the "Merged Ontology", i.e. there are
bound to be cases of axioms and/or subsumption relations contradicting one
another.  I don't know where these inconsistencies are, since I've
eliminated the ones that I've found myself and the ones that have been
brought to my attention by others.  Nevertheless, it is a large and complex
document, and there are undoubtedly contradictions lurking somewhere.
Though Chris and I agree about the presence of inconsistency in the "Merged
Ontology", we apparently disagree about how to handle this inconsistency.
To my mind, the remaining cases of contradiction should be resolved
point-by-point rather than by tossing out everything that has been done thus
far.  As for the criticism that the "Merged Ontology" lacks a "practical
purpose", I think this misses the mark.  The "Merged Ontology" includes many
high-level concepts that have a direct application in science and
engineering contexts, e.g. a biological taxonomy, formal notions of units of
measure, mathematical functions, and temporal axioms.  Furthermore, all of
these practical concepts have been tied into a single, compact lattice of
concepts/axioms that allows these more practical concepts to draw from the
same store of semantic content.  If there are some high-level concepts that
are lacking in the document and that are needed in science/engineering
contexts, I would be happy to include them.

-Ian

&gt; Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat and John 
&gt; say - is not
&gt; sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as 
&gt; Matthew says - does
&gt; not seem to be ready for practical use.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that - as it stands - the Ontology is not 
&gt; really a standard
&gt; that is fit for any practical purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of making concrete
&gt; suggestions via email is adequate for the task at hand. A point that a
&gt; number of people have made in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete 
&gt; suggestion for a way
&gt; to produce an adequate product. I think the task is of a size 
&gt; that anything
&gt; I would suggest would involve the old standards such as a project with
&gt; resources and a plan that gave some substance to the process 
&gt; of analysis to
&gt; be followed and the deliverables. But there is no point in 
&gt; starting this
&gt; unless there is some kind of commitment in terms of resources.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Chris
