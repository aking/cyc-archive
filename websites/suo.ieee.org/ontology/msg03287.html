JA = Jon Awbrey
JC = John Collier

JC: I am assuming that ~ is not in the language.  Only &amp; and v.

JA: Gosh, you're right, that is dumb!

JA: Once again, from a pragmatic perspective, Peircean style, logics are not
    autonomous systems, sui generis, laws unto themselves, but normative and
    speculative branches on the tree of semiotics, and thus, by Biblical and
    Shakespearean principles of &quot;measure for measure&quot;, subject to evaluation
    in accord with the objective that logic in general is conceived to serve.
    It is from this setting that one can judge a nonsense, or else be judged
    by evolution for failing to do so, and from this POV that one always had
    the axis, the fulcrum, the lever, and the moment of force that is needed
    to pivot through sundry degrees of freedom in one's selection of logical
    and semiotic systems.

JC: I am sympathetic to this view, inasmuch as I understand it.
    We are certainly getting more clear about where we differ,
    which is progress.  I still regard logic as transcendent,
    and would be very reluctant to give this up.

I do not use the word &quot;transcendent&quot; in this context very much,
but that is mostly because of conflicting claims from too many
different directions.  But I think that a proper understanding
of &quot;formal&quot;, in the sense of &quot;quasi-necessary&quot;, and a grokking
of the ways that norms are defined in terms of limit processes,
might just cover most of what is desirable in that inclination.

JC: It may be an article of faith for me, but it is a very small amount of faith
    in terms of the propositions one must accept.  The view you describe as Peirce's
    I would agree provides the meaning (in the sense of 'sense' or grasp) of logic,
    but not, I think its object (reference or being).

It is the purpose of a sign relational framework to provide room for both reference and sense.
Whether that room gets filled is another sort of question.  I gave you an example of a logical
proposition that has empirical content, as any proposition that is successfully interpreted to
describe an object reality does.  How does this propositional expression acquire that virtue?
Much in the way that any sign does, because a &quot;community of interpretation&quot; (COI) uses it
as a part of its &quot;try at objectivity&quot; (TAO) to describe a pragma of concern or interest
to them.  That, plus all of the &quot;standard operating procedures&quot; (SOP's) that it takes
to assay construct validity and to test intercoder reliability.  Standard stuff.
While a certain sort worries about &quot;grounding symbols&quot; the world goes on using
these symbols to get a grip on reality in just the way that it evolved to do.

JC: In particular, I am not convinced that sense exhausts meaning,
    which is my residual and pretty minimal rationalism speaking.
    I think that there are important things that one cannot
    represent fully.  But I have already said this.

I cannot even imagine, after all this time, why you might think
that a pragmatician would ever say that &quot;sense exhausts meaning&quot; --
or why you think that there is a choice between empiricism and
rationalism that is somehow implied by the pragmatic maxim.
