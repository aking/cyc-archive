GENREIC DISCLAIMER

1.  The writer writes under the presumption that the substance,
    if any, of what he writes is characterizable under either
    one of two cases:

    a.  Wholly derivative subsidiary to the works
        of one Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914).

    b.  Wrong.

2.  If the writer writes anything, the substance of which,
    if any, he presumes to originate with himself, he will
    be sure to make a special note of it, and to issue the
    appropriate notification.  Otherwise, the presumption
    may safely revert to that covered in Clause 1, above.

3.  If any other writer, or representative of a fictive
    entity, intelligent of otherwise, should presume to
    imagine that he, she, it sees in the writing of the
    present writer some reflection of his, her, its own
    original and proprietary thought, then the present
    writer suggests what is most likely the much safer
    presumption, in deed, he puts forth a claim as to
    what is most likely the much greater probability,
    that the other writer or representative exhibits
    thereby the lack of due diligence required to
    establish the truth of the matter, to wit,
    that the substance, if any, of what the
    other writer writes is characterizable
    under either one of two cases:

    a.  Wholly derivative subsidiary to the works
        of one Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914).

    b.  Wrong.

&gt; Cars run on roads, but one doesn't do vehicle design by looking at tarmac.

Actually, one does ...

Google Search on  &lt;vehicle design tarmac road asphalt&gt;
turned up 322 hits.  Not to be picky, I deal the card
off the top of the deck, which oddly enough turns out
to be on AI (Accident Investigation), very intriguing:

&gt; AI's make increasing use of computer software packages to
&gt; process and analyse specific accident data and trajectories
&gt; accurately.  The data input is derived from: 
&gt; 
&gt; -- mathematical models, formulas and calculations derived from the laws of physics 
&gt; -- statistical correlations collected from previous RTAs and field test results 
&gt; -- vehicle occupant crash models 
&gt; -- pedestrian impact models 
&gt; -- manufacturers' vehicle handling and tyre performance data 
&gt; -- independent research investigations 
&gt; 
&gt; Forensic science, based on Locard's Principle
&gt; that states 'every contact leaves a trace' is
&gt; as important to road traffic accidents as it
&gt; is to murder scenes.  The difference is that
&gt; the AI is dealing with tyre marks and vehicle
&gt; damage rather than fingerprints and cloth fibres. 
&gt;
...
&gt;
&gt; The maximum cornering speed a vehicle is capable of can be also be determined
&gt; by the friction value of the road surface.  Attempting to negotiate too tight
&gt; a corner or bend at a speed beyond the critical limit is one of the main causes
&gt; of vehicle occupant fatalities.  The front tyres remain on their steered course,
&gt; but the unsteered rear wheels loose adhesion, putting the car into a spin which
&gt; presents one side of the car, (the least protected part) to the front.  Should
&gt; the side of the car hit a lamp post, tree or another approaching vehicle the
&gt; chances of escaping injury are very low.  Impact depth is calculated at
&gt; one inch for each mph of impact speed. 
&gt;
...

Now, this is about AI, but I think that
the impacts on vehicle design are clear.
I was going to invert the metaphormasis
to derive the bearing of this lesson on
the relation between logic and semiotic,
but, of course, Peirce already did that:

| 'On the Definition of Logic'.
|
| Logic will here be defined as 'formal semiotic'.
| A definition of a sign will be given which no more
| refers to human thought than does the definition
| of a line as the place which a particle occupies,
| part by part, during a lapse of time.  Namely,
| a sign is something, 'A', which brings something,
| 'B', its 'interpretant' sign determined or created
| by it, into the same sort of correspondence with
| something, 'C', its 'object', as that in which it
| itself stands to 'C'.  It is from this definition,
| together with a definition of "formal", that I
| deduce mathematically the principles of logic.
| I also make a historical review of all the
| definitions and conceptions of logic, and show,
| not merely that my definition is no novelty, but
| that my non-psychological conception of logic has
| 'virtually' been quite generally held, though not
| generally recognized.  (CSP, NEM 4, 20-21).
