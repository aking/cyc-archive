&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; You asked for a reply if the view is flawed.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it is -- and importantly so for the ontology of
&gt; operational computer systems, If you study the history
&gt; of science one of the things frequently noted is that
&gt; scientific revolutions involve a new theory that is
&gt; both more general and simpler than the original ones.
&gt; I suspect we need a new yardstick to describe this --
&gt; sophistication say.  Then one can have generality
&gt; with or without sophistication.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that one of the reasons a lot of people hold the view
&gt; you put forward is because of the nature of a particular ontology --
&gt; let's call it Aristotelian -- which is implicit in a lot of database
&gt; designs.  Here there is a tree taxonomy -- under which it seems that
&gt; as you make things more general you lose detail.

Petty point:  It would probably be a bit more apt to attribute
this form of "arboreal thinking" to Plato.  My personal favorite
example can be found distributed throughout his 'Sophist' dialogue --
co-incidents?  I do not think so!  -- where one discovers, over time,
the burlesque bit that is batted back and forth and carried on between
the Stranger and Theaetetus expounding as it goes a roughly binary tree
of depth roughly 10.  But still, now that I am reminded of it, even here
the terminal leaves of the tree, at least, the ones that it is the whole
object of the exercise to ripen into fruition, if even to the point of
their overripe rot becoming thoroughly manifestered in the roasting
that the Sophist is being thrown -- these branches all retroserrate
back upon the person in question who is being celeberated in this
style.  So, I take it all back, Plato was far more sophisticated
than we commonly give him his "due-fors"!

But actually, that was not what I opened
this window to say, so let me move on.

&gt; If you have a lattice this is not so.  Interestingly
&gt; the shift from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics, the
&gt; structure of the theory became more lattice-like, less
&gt; tree-like.  And also more general and more 'traction'.
&gt; (if anyone is interested this is a central theme of
&gt; my book Business Objects).
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me that one of the overriding reasons
&gt; for producing an ontology is to have something general
&gt; with traction.  My book describes a method for taking more
&gt; specific data models and constructing more general models with
&gt; more (not less) traction.  In fact, one of the surprising aspects
&gt; of my experience using this is that generality naturally results
&gt; in more rather than less traction.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Chris

Chris, for those of us who cannot seem to catch up with our email
long enough to get away to a bookstore -- would you be willing to
e-laborate a little bit more on your notions of "sophistication"
and "traction"?

Thanks In Prospect,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; Matthew West says:
&gt; 
&gt; One of the things I have learnt is
&gt; what I think you are suggesting here:
&gt; that if something is OK for a particular purpose,
&gt; then it is OK for a particular purpose,
&gt; and this is OK.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that it might not be OK for another purpose,
&gt; what then?  10 different models of the same thing each OK
&gt; for its particular purpose?  not much of a standard I think.
&gt; On the other hand One model into which each of these 10 could
&gt; be translated, allowing communication between them all could
&gt; possibly be very useful, and something worth standardising.
&gt; 
&gt; There seems to be an implicit assumption here that it is
&gt; POSSIBLE to have an ontology that is good for all purposes,
&gt; or at least a very very wide range of them.  I think there
&gt; is an inherent generality/power tradeoff.  Only somethign
&gt; very general can serve a very wide range of purposes,
&gt; but then it will provide little traction.  Somethgn
&gt; very specific, designed for a particular purpose
&gt; will be more powerful, giving more traction,
&gt; but will serve fewer purposes.  I see this as
&gt; a fundamental tradeoff that will never go away.
&gt; Please correct me if this view is flawed.
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
