Pat, 
	.	Sorry for being a bit edgy. There's a certain aspect of
unambiguity that I am having difficulty communicating to the group. I am
trying to get down to basic clarity of the "the cat sat on the mat" variety,
to provide a base to build from, rather than start with all the plethora of
meanings we have in ordinary communication. I see computer languages as
tending towards this more restricted and bottom-up meaning basis. I am edgy
because I have copped quite a bit of flack, and what seemed like derision,
earlier on, over this and related issues. 

	.		Further comments interspersed below, prefaced "GH2&gt;
".

&gt;Pat,
&gt;	.	Comments interspersed, prefaced "GH&gt;	".
&gt;
&gt;	.	I have a more involved structure in mind than is necessarily
&gt;evident in any particular communication.
&gt;

OK, fair enough.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Douglas,
&gt; &gt;	.		Why should what you are saying necessarily be so?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	To me you are addressing the matter that, often, people
&gt; &gt;don't precisely define their utterances, with the result that the
&gt; &gt;information interpreted doesn't always match that uttered. But, that
&gt; &gt;doesn't mean that everyone is as ambiguous as everyone else, nor
&gt; &gt;that ambiguity is unavoidable if sufficient care is expended to be
&gt; &gt;precise.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	Leaving out all sorts of issues of freedom for people to
&gt; &gt;express themselves as they wish, including as ambiguously as
&gt; &gt;they like, why will not the precision of computer languages serve
&gt; &gt;to achieve unambiguity? Allowing for the severely restricted
&gt; &gt;vocabulary, if I communicate to you in a computer language in
&gt; &gt;which you are literate, surely you will understand precisely what I
&gt; &gt;say?
&gt;
&gt;No, you won't. When was the last time you actually READ code, instead of
&gt;running it?
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;	In view of your tone, how about you guess first?

Sorry if I got a little too ad hominem there. I meant only that one tends to
run software which others send to one, rather than read it. Well, most of us
do.

&gt;You might also care
&gt;to speculate about what I have conceived and developed with it also.

I forbear to speculate about other peoples personal lives. Maybe you eat
Microsoft CDs for breakfast, I don't know.

&gt;PH&gt; But theres a deeper misunderstanding here. When you say 
&gt;'computer language'
&gt;do you mean 'programming language' (which is only even called a 'language'
&gt;by a kind of extension from normal usage) or do you mean 'language for
&gt;expressing meanings which is stored in a computer' ?
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;	Whether it's one or the other makes very little conceptual
&gt;difference. The concept is that each element has a precisely defined
&gt;interpretation. Note that I did NOT say "a precisely defined
&gt;implementation".

No, I hear the difference, but I still think you are wrong. A formal
ontology language DOESNT provide a precise, unambiguous meaning for all its
terms. (In fact, one can often prove quite rigorously that a truly
unambiguous meaning is impossible to achieve using any of a wide class of
formal logics, using some variation of Godel's theorem. 

GH2&gt;	I don't know Godel, but I would suspect that such a proof would
likely refer to a particular type of ambiguity with quite specific logical
boundaries, not applying to all; circumstances.. 

There is a notable contrast here between logics and programming languages,
and it comes out clearly in their formal semantic theories. Programming
language semantics typically relies on the recursion theorem to guarantee
the existence of *unique* minimal fixedpoints of recursive constructions.
Ontology languages are usually not even able to express finiteness
unambiguously, and the second recursion theorem doesnt apply to assertional
logics, in general. This is the price they pay for having a semantics which
claims to be able to talk about anything, not just the things that can be
finitely constructed by mechanical operations inside computing engines. 

GH2&gt;	As an engineer, who was not trained in anything above the most basic
logic (I did a small philosophy unit, in addition to the logic deriving from
my engineering mathematics), I do not know a lot of the terms you used here.
Could you perhaps give an example? I will then attempt to answer in terms of
approaches I used in developing interactive knowledge-based decision-making
software some years ago. That forced me to address the issue of ambiguity in
a practical way. 

&gt;There is nothing particularly *computerish* about an ontology language;
&gt;or if there is, that aspect of it adds nothing to its conceptual or
&gt;ontological clarity or precision.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;	Well, we agree on that one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	If we start from this sort of basis, and I don't care
&gt; &gt;whether it's using a "CE" or "KIF", then why won't we achieve
&gt; &gt;unambiguous communication?
&gt;
&gt;Because KIF and CE only specify the logical framework within which the
&gt;ontological meanings are to be expressed, not those meanings themselves.
&gt;Not that this is to be sneezed at, I hasten to add; but it isnt a magical
&gt;guarantee against misunderstanding.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt; 	Yes, you've picked me up validly here. I should have said: ".....
&gt;then why won't we be able to achieve unambiguous communication?"

It depends what you mean by 'unambiguous'. I think maybe we will be able to
achieve workable communication, just as human beings do all the time; which
really means something like, we havnt found anything to disagree about yet.
But that kind of 'unambiguous' communication always has to be open to
further negotiation in order to resolve misunderstandings which might only
surface later.  If you really mean full semantic unambiguity, which would be
in model-theoretic terms there being a unique model, then one can prove that
this is almost always unobtainable. Just having us both use Peano arithmetic
is enough to guarantee that this couldnt be possible. 

GH2&gt;	We agree here too. It's another point I've addressed in this forum
before. Basically, I don't believe that sort of unambiguity can ever be
possible, because we can never know everything about the Universe. At best
our knowledge could be asymptotic with omniscience, tho' I doubt even that.
As I see it, knowledge (and for that matter any logic, "KIF" or any other
type of language) has always been a "bottom-up" science. To me it started
from the earliest instances of biological intelligence (on Earth or possibly
some other astronomical location), and continues as knowledge and technology
advances further and further (until and unless Earth derived intelligence is
wiped out). I feel any belief in the possibility of developing a perfect and
universal logic "top-down" will be impossible as no-one has ever been up to
the "top" (ie. infinity) to survey the totality of what is involved. 

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	I admit, that when it comes to expressing complex
&gt; &gt;and/or sophisticated concepts, then the communication will require:
&gt; &gt;*	prefacing with some assumed structure (eg. possibly the
&gt; &gt;concept that anger arises out of fear); and
&gt; &gt;*	a great deal of elaboration to ensure every aspect is defined.
&gt;
&gt;You should read Quine on the indeterminacy of translation, and then see if
&gt;you are still so confident that this 'great deal of elaboration' is always
&gt;going to work.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt; 	My statement may have to be read in light of some of my previous
&gt;contributions. If one starts with a small and precisely defined structure,
&gt;then one can be precise within the scope of that structure.

But then how is the structure itself communicated? (Of course, if we assume
that our ideas are sufficiently well aligned before we start communicating,
then we can communicate arbitrarily well.) 

GH2&gt;	Looking at the modes of communication used by various species across
the planet, this description of yours seems to fairly accurately cover the
totality of how we can ever hope to communicate. What I am saying is that,
with a bit of thought, we can reduce ambiguities over normal language by
restricting the ranges of meanings allowable for each word and also
restricting the range of allowable grammatical structures. To me, this is
all that can be achieved by any "KIF". 

&gt;GH&gt; 	I am NOT saying any language will be able to achieve perfect
&gt;unambiguous communication in all circumstances. As the breadth of coverage
&gt;extends, it will periodically be necessary to amend particular terms, and
&gt;even, from time to time, conceptual structures.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt; 	The advance of humanity and technology have repeatedly involved this
&gt;sort of mechanism throughout history. For example, the Earth used to be
seen
&gt;as the centre of the Universe. Later this status was accorded the Sun. More
&gt;recently the conceptual structure had to change yet more.

Yes, and these changes are often described as 'scientific revolutions', for
a good reason. They involve destroying the old foundations and starting
over, a long and painful process usually taking more than one human
generation. 

GH2&gt;	Agreed. In computer languages and applications, they are promulgated
as "new versions", some of which are "complete rewrites" or "completely
re-engineered", for just this sort of reason. The same thing applies to car
models, and more generally in engineering over the millennia. I do think you
are slightly overstating things here. I suggest a lot of the original
foundations are, in fact, retained, and only the incompatible parts are
destroyed as the understanding becomes more accurate. 

&gt;GH&gt; 	However, I am suggesting that a basic structure can be developed to
&gt;have "meta-" elements that allow extrapolation to cover quite a range of
&gt;matters, provided the extrapolation is done in a carefully structured way.

Maybe. That "meta-" idea is certainly a universal hope. We plan to have a
meta-extension to SUO-KIF which will be able in principle to describe any
syntactic mapping. But syntax isnt really the hard issue here, of course.
..... 

GH2&gt;	Agreed. But I suggest the dimensional analysis approach I have been
suggesting will be helpful in sorting out the content structures into more
co-ordinated patterns. I noticed the total silence that my last e-mail on
that matter attracted, Sometimes I get the impression such contributions
aren't being understood. That surprises me because I feel information
modelling and logic as inherently quite closely related fields of endeavour.


&gt;GH&gt; 	Regardless of what language we use, the same aspects will apply. Jon
&gt;Awbrey has been trying to warn us of this aspect throughout the project.
&gt;Using KIF does not avoid the problem you are raising.

Oh, indeed not. KIF doesnt really solve any ontological problems at all; its
just a language. 

GH2&gt;	Actually, I have been giving some thought to this in the past few
days. I see the benefit of a "KIF" or "MRE" (modified restricted language)
is that it contains grammatical rules specifically developed to limit the
opportunities for illogical structures. This is where it should provide an
advantage over just working in more traditional information modelling
languages such as UML (unified modelling language) or ORM (object - role
modelling). So, basically, I feel the KIFs &amp; MREs of this world are
something beyond the average language. 

GH2&gt;	That said, I would love to see someone tack the graphical facilities
of such languages on to one of them. In many ways the "language" of ORM
seems very like ACE, so I suggest that would provide considerable potential
for merging these technologies. I believe the power of something like ORM
would aid ontological development significantly, by enabling people to
visualise the conceptual structures they are generating. I believe it would
be far more powerful than what I have seen of CGs.
