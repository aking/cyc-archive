Dear Jon,

&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Strand 3.  Embedded Tables &amp; Extended Relations
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  There were a few issues about "embedded", "indexed", "keyed",
&gt;      or "ordered" relational tables that were initially raised in
&gt;      the present frame, and so I will try to address them now, at
&gt;      least until the running accumulation of bits grows too large.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  This filiation is offspring to your comment that,
&gt;      with regard to your putative method of reduction:
&gt; 
&gt;      | MW:  Where I come from this method would
&gt;      |      be informally known as reification.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Having seen more of your elaboration of what you are 
&gt; actually doing,
&gt;      I begin to see this more as a matter of two kinds of 
&gt; embedding that
&gt;      you are carrying out on the given relation, and one of 
&gt; these brands
&gt;      of embedding, extension, or extenuation does bear a 
&gt; relation to the
&gt;      operation that is classically known as "hypostatic 
&gt; abstraction", or
&gt;      else as "reification".  But all of these operations act 
&gt; to increase
&gt;      the arity of the relation, so I really do not see how 
&gt; they help the
&gt;      case that you want to establish.  I have sorted out 
&gt; these questions
&gt;      for separate discussion in this note.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Concreteness in the beginning is hardly misplaced,
&gt;      so let us consider a discreetly simple example of
&gt;      a relational database, just to pick one at random
&gt;      from off the grainy strand beneath our feet, here:
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Relation L(&amp;) = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x &amp; y = z}.
&gt; 
&gt;      o-----o-----o---------o
&gt;      |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
&gt;      o-----o-----o---------o
&gt;      |  0  |  0  |    0    |
&gt;      |  0  |  1  |    0    |
&gt;      |  1  |  0  |    0    |
&gt;      |  1  |  1  |    1    |
&gt;      o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  There are many different ways to embed a k-adic relational table
&gt;      in a more spacious and sumptious table, that is, one that enjoys
&gt;      either more rows or more columns or both, and with whatever form
&gt;      of extenutaion is chosen to extend the relation thus represented
&gt;      either to larger samples of its initial cartesian product domain,
&gt;      or else to relations of augmented audacity, arete, or valoration.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  But you have already instanced for me the two most common types
&gt;      of embedding or extension, and so it is meet that we take these
&gt;      up first.  Let us just contemplate their basic forms all in one
&gt;      place, and leave off discussing the details to later in the day.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Extension 1.  Abstract Hypostasy, Reflective Entitlement.
&gt; 
&gt;      o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt;      |    t    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
&gt;      o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt;      | "L(&amp;)"  |  0  |  0  |    0    |
&gt;      | "L(&amp;)"  |  0  |  1  |    0    |
&gt;      | "L(&amp;)"  |  1  |  0  |    0    |
&gt;      | "L(&amp;)"  |  1  |  1  |    1    |
&gt;      o---------o-----o-----o---------o

MW: I don't follow this.
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Extension 2.  Indexing, Keying, Ordering, Sequencing.
&gt; 
&gt;      o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt;      |    n    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
&gt;      o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt;      |    1    |  0  |  0  |    0    |
&gt;      |    2    |  0  |  1  |    0    |
&gt;      |    3    |  1  |  0  |    0    |
&gt;      |    4    |  1  |  1  |    1    |
&gt;      o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; 
&gt; JA:  Some of the names, of course, are not yet standard.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  In the interests of clarity, this can be seen as an
&gt;      intermediate step in the transformation I am making.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Having introduced the index (the reification step) ...
&gt; 
&gt; Gasp!
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  then each of the components of each row is related to that index.
&gt;      This gives you a basis for creating a relation for each 
&gt; column, so:
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  n  = {1,2,3,4}
&gt; 
&gt;      x = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,0&gt;, &lt;3,1&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}
&gt; 
&gt;      y = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,1&gt;, &lt;3,0&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}
&gt; 
&gt;      z = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,0&gt;, &lt;3,0&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I fail to see why you think x, y, z are not relations.
&gt;      I have swopped 1 tradic relation for 3 dyadic relations
&gt;      plus a set.
&gt; 
&gt; Unhuh, and are these three 2-adic relations
&gt; just hanging out there, blowing in the wind,
&gt; as if they were to wash up on the shores of
&gt; your certainty, each one a detached message,
&gt; all dispersed in welters of many-splintered
&gt; brands and colors of bottles, that the wine
&gt; darks seas of the world give up to you, and
&gt; you, on receipt of this gift, how would you
&gt; even know that each message had any bearing
&gt; on the meaning of the others, if not by way
&gt; of some clue that you can persieve or purse
&gt; seine or just plain abdeuce to be contained
&gt; therein, read between the letters and lines?

MW: Not at all, they are linked by the objects
they contain (though it would be sensible not
to use 1,2,3,4 as the index as you have done
since at least 1 is also used to represent
a different object in the matrix).

&gt; And are these characters, in their pedigree,
&gt; any kind'o'kin to the gang'o'four you hinge
&gt; them on, or do they hang but separately, as
&gt; nothing but instances of one dummy variable
&gt; after'n'other?

MW: Very colourful, but you lost me.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  It is relatively straight forward to do the
&gt;      transformation in each direction, so they
&gt;      are equivalent.
&gt; 
&gt; Not so.
&gt; 
&gt; You must remember this:
&gt; A set is still a set,
&gt; as the index goes by.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider an "indexed 3-adic relation",
&gt; which is really this 4-adic relation:
&gt; 
&gt; o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; |    n    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
&gt; o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; |    1    |  1  |  1  |    1    |
&gt; |    2    |  1  |  0  |    0    |
&gt; |    3    |  0  |  1  |    0    |
&gt; |    4    |  0  |  0  |    0    |
&gt; o---------o-----o-----o---------o
&gt; 
&gt; This is a distinct 4-adic relation that might
&gt; well arise in any number of applications from
&gt; what is fundamentally the same 3-adic relation.
&gt; Indeed, there are 4! = 24 distinct such 4-adics
&gt; that may easily arise in one setting or another
&gt; out of the same 3-adic relation that we had in
&gt; the beginning.  

MW: I don't follow this move. To me 1,2,3,4 are (or 
should be) unique object identifiers in the Universe
of Discourse (1 isn't here so there is a problem).

&gt; So the mapping is not 1 to 1,
&gt; but 1 to 24, and this does not make for any
&gt; kind of invertible transformation, nor any
&gt; kind of equivalence between formal objects.
&gt; 
&gt; You have come to the very threshold of teridentity, my friend.

MW: Save me, save me!!!!
