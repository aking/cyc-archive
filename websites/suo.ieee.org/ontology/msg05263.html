HOC.  Discussion Note 2

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

JA  = Jon Awbrey
L&amp;S = Lambek &amp; Scott
MA  = Murray Altheim

JA: Actually, if could you get as far as understanding the definition
    of a natural transformation on page 8, that would be a lot.  But
    there's no reason to expect that you could do that on your own.
    I spent a lot of time on the SUO list trying to get across basic
    category-theoretic ways of thinking in concrete contexts without
    ever mentioning the legion of officious titles, ideas which folks
    would need to grasp before they could understand 1/10 of what RK
    is talking about, but they seem to prefer the razzle-dazzle to
    the nitty-gritty.

MA: Both the razzle-dazzle and the nitty-gritty are snowing me right now.

JA: What you ran into is the sort of place where the authors try
    to impress people who have had a couple of years of graduate
    courses in algebra and topology with the fact that they can
    sum up those two years of study in a single paragraph.  But
    that is just a side-show bit, and you can ignore all of it.
    In my notes to the Ontology List I skipped from page 11 to
    page 41 just by way of getting to the logical motivations
    a little quicker.

MA: So basically, you're saying to ignore the &quot;Introduction to Category Theory&quot;
    section and jump straight to &quot;Cartesian closed categories and Lambda Calculus&quot;?
    After understanding through page 8?

MA: Part of the difficult is language:  I don't have any experience
    in this particular use of English.  Even simple stuff is not so
    simple without the background, and I tend to not like to guess.
    E.g., the idea that a morphism &quot;sends objects of $A$ to objects
    of $B$ and arrows of $A$ to arrows of $B$&quot; might sound ostensibly
    like some kind of &quot;morphing&quot;, but I have no idea what it really
    means in practice.  &quot;sends&quot;?  How is that different from &quot;maps&quot;?

&quot;maps&quot; and &quot;sends&quot; are just synonyms here.

in the beginning one starts with concrete categories:

HOC.    <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/thrd36.html#03373">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/thrd36.html#03373</A>
HOC 1.  <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg03373.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg03373.html</A>

L&amp;S: | Part 0.  Introduction to Category Theory
     |
     | 1.  Categories and Functors
     |
     | In this section we present what our reader is expected
     | to know about category theory.  We begin with a rather
     | informal definition.
     |
     | Definition 1.1.  A 'concrete category' is a collection of two kinds
     | of entities, called 'objects' and 'morphisms'.  The former are sets
     | which are endowed with some kind of structure, and the latter are
     | mappings, that is, functions from one object to another, in some
     | sense preserving that structure.  Among the morphisms, there is
     | attached to each object A the 'identity mapping' 1_A : A -&gt; A
     | such that 1_A(a) = a for all a in A.  Moreover, morphisms
     | f : A -&gt; B and g : B -&gt; C may be 'composed' to produce
     | a morphism gf : A -&gt; C such that (gf)(a) = g(f(a))
     | for all a in A.

this is the checklist for any category:

1.  what are the objects?
2.  what are the arrows?
3.  is there an identity arrow for each object?
4.  is there a composition operation on arrows?

for a concrete category, the objects are sets.
for a concrete category, the arrows are mappings between sets.
(in concrete categories, the arrows are usually called morphisms).

L&amp;S: | Example C1.  The category of 'sets'.  Its objects are
     | arbitrary sets and its morphisms are arbitrary mappings.
     | We call this category &quot;Sets&quot;.

Category C1 = Sets.
C1 takes any set to be an object of the category.
C1 takes any mapping between sets to be an arrow.
(this is a case of trivial structure to preserve.)

the next examples are sets plus &quot;structure&quot;,
in these cases, something like a &quot;sums table&quot;,
a &quot;times table&quot;, or a &quot;less than&quot; relation is
defined on the sets of the category and also
preserved by the arrows of the category.

L&amp;S: | Example C2.  The category of 'monoids'.  Its objects are
     | monoids, that is, semigroups with unity element, and its
     | morphisms are homomorphisms, that is, mappings which
     | preserve multiplication (the semigroup operation)
     | and the unity element.

a classic example would be the logarithm mapping from
a domain (D, *) of real numbers under multiplication (*)
to a domain (E, +) of real numbers under addition (+).

1.  log : (D, *) -&gt; (E, +).

    the log function maps the object D to the object E,
    mapping the structure of (*) to the structure of (+).

2.  log(1) = 0.

    the log function maps the multiplicative identity 1
    to the additive identity 0.

3.  log(x * y) = log(x) + log(y)

    one says:  &quot;the image of the product is the sum of the images&quot;.
    this describes a form of analogy or metaphor between (*) and (+).

L&amp;S: | Example C3.  The category of 'preordered sets'.
     | Its objects are preordered sets, that is, sets
     | with a reflexive and transitive relation on them,
     | and its morphisms are monotone mappings, that is,
     | mappings that preserve this relation.

say that (D, -&lt;) is a reflexive and transitive order relation on D.
say that (E, =&lt;) is a reflexive and transitive order relation on E.

a &quot;monotone&quot; (order-preserving) mapping f : D -&gt; E is one such that:

x -&lt; y  implies  f(x) =&lt; f(y),

again, we can think of f as describing or establishing an analogy or
a metaphor between the ordering (-&lt;) on D and the ordering (=&lt;) on E.

JA: Category theory is really just a study in metaphors.
    And, well, metaphors between metaphors (= functors).
    And, well, metaphors between functors (= nat.trans).
    In one of my first courses in this stuff we got to
    do a &quot;creative&quot; final paper, and I wrote an intro
    to the main ideas in the form of a science fiction
    story.  Probably still have it buried in a basement
    box somewhere, but don't know if I could find it now.

MA: While stories like that sometimes help, they also sometimes
    just mask the actual content.  What would be great would be
    a discussion of this in plain English, if that were possible.

JA: The stuff that I append here could provide us with a good couple
    of months of study, but then you'd have the most essential bits.

MA: ???  You have appended the literal contents of pages 4-8 of the book.

yes, just that much.

MA: And I must say that while the symbols in the book are difficult,
    their transformations into ASCII make it quite a bit harder to
    deal with.

you get used to it.  and it's quick.

MA: Maybe if we just honed in on something at the beginning?
    Say, Example C4, where we see definitions for deductive
    systems and categories.

okay, tomorrow ...
