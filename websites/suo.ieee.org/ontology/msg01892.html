&gt; &gt;  - A little something about rationale, approach and choices, e.g. why
&gt; &gt;  did you introduce @arg,
&gt;
&gt;You mean, why did I introduce row variables?  Well, there's four
&gt;paragraphs on row variables there, including an explicit semantics for
&gt;them, but the simple answer is that they give KIF a great deal of
&gt;additional expressive power (noted at various points in the
&gt;documentation statements).

Also, to be fair, Chris didnt *introduce* row variables: they are in 
the original KIF spec, and all we have done is to provide them with a 
decent semantics.

&gt; &gt; Why did you stop short of extensional classes?
&gt;
&gt;Because people often talk about classes in a way that does not
&gt;presuppose extensionality.  Seems to me to be a good methodological
&gt;principle not to force a relatively simple issue when you don't have to.

Chris is being slightly disingenuous here. There are actually two 
distinct issues. First, Chris has a philosophical taste for a 
non-extensional view of classes and relations. I disagree with him 
about that. But there is another, technical, reason for keeping the 
relation/extension distinction in the KIF semantics, which is that it 
provides an elegant semantic mechanism for interpreting a logic with 
a 'free syntax', in which for example expressions like
(R R) can be written and are meaningful. This is a compelling reason 
for maintaining the distinction in the logic; particularly as anyone 
who wishes to assert that relations are to be understood 
extensionally can say that with a single simple axiom, eg by 
asserting:
(=&gt; (forall (@x) (&lt;=&gt; (?rel1 @x)(?rel2 @x)))
      (= ?rel1 ?rel2))
......

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm afraid this does not compute with me. I was also not aware of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demand for this (whose requirement is this? what are the benefits?)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one wants to develop an ontology that embodies a conception
&gt; &gt; &gt; of time on which the future is not determinate, and hence on which
&gt; &gt; &gt; there are past and present objects, but no determinate future
&gt; &gt; &gt; objects.  (Such a conception might be useful, say, in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; manufacturing system that has to calculate on the fly the number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of objects it is going to produce during any given run
&gt; &gt; &gt; depending on demand.)  On such a conception, the class of humans
&gt; &gt; &gt; grows moment by moment with each birth (or conception, or whatever
&gt; &gt; &gt; your criterion is for being human).  But if classes are extensional,
&gt; &gt; &gt; they don't "grow"; `human' picks out a different class with each
&gt; &gt; &gt; birth.  Now, maybe that's ok with you; maybe it's the way it should
&gt; &gt; &gt; be.  But there are, it seems to me, intuitions that warrant saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; that membership in the class of humans can change over time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Extensionality is omitted simply to for allow such a conception of
&gt; &gt; &gt; class.  Add extensionality if you don't like it.

Chris' view of 'existence', class-membership and time is 
idiosyncratic and I think woefully confused, and it is not forced on 
one by non-extensionality or by assuming that the future is 
indeterminate. And as I said, this isn't the only, or in my view the 
main, reason why the KIF model theory is the way it is:certainly one 
should not think of KIF as endorsing these positions.  But his final 
point is the main one: the logic makes no committment to 
extensionality one way or the other. It does not assume it, but it 
also doesn't deny it. The fewer philosophical assumptions imposed by 
the underlying language, the better.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: OK - of course one of the benefits of a 4D approach is that all this
&gt; &gt; comes out in the wash, so extensional classes don't have a problem.
&gt;
&gt;At the cost of loss of generality.  Your 4D approach forces a conception
&gt;of time on which one has to view the future as determinate.

No, Chris, it doesn't force that conception. The following might be 
the same misunderstanding, in a different form:

&gt; That's
&gt;exactly the kind of decision I don't think should be forced on users in
&gt;an ontology meant for general use, and I suspect that is likely to be
&gt;problematic in certain contexts.  Furthermore, your 4D approach doesn't
&gt;allow for the possibility that there could have been other things --
&gt;other humans, say -- than the ones that actually exist at some time or
&gt;other, since, by definition, the class HUMAN comprises just the actual
&gt;humans.

It doesn't restrict one to considering only the actual humans. In 
fact, by providing a uniform notion of 'enclosing' spatiotemporal 
plenum, it actually elegantly supports an ontology of alternative 
world-lines. The issues of 4d/3d, and of representing nondeterminate 
futures or alternative possible worlds, are almost completely 
orthogonal.

&gt; So if you ever need to add modality, your 4D extensional
&gt;classes are once again likely to be problematic.

Maybe if you wanted to add modality, but that is another issue. Modal 
languages are not the only way to talk about nondeterminate futures 
or alternative possiblities.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If classes are non-extensional then I presume membership can also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change over time.  There needs to be something that explains how you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get to the membership at some point in time.
&gt; &gt; &gt;

The presumption is unwarranted. There may be many reasons for wishing 
to have non-extensional classes other than temporal considerations. 
For one example: it can be argued that since not all sets are 
classes, there must be something more to a class other than simply 
the set comprising its extension. (I don't think much of this 
argument, but I've heard it made.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure I understand the question, but it's irrelevant until
&gt; &gt; &gt; you add a temporality to the axioms somehow, either by introducing
&gt; &gt; &gt; temporal operators and an appropriate extension to the semantics or
&gt; &gt; &gt; an explicit theory of time.  If you do, then presumably you'd have
&gt; &gt; &gt; to add something like a temporal parameter to all predicates,
&gt; &gt; &gt; including instance-of, so that talks instead of being an instance-of
&gt; &gt; &gt; class C *at some time* t.

You wouldnt HAVE to add such a temporal parameter to relations. That 
is one way to proceeed, but there are others.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I keep struggling with it, but I know from experience with data
&gt; &gt; models that languages like this are often missread by non-experts such
&gt; &gt; as myself.  Also the introducion of (to me) new elements like @args
&gt; &gt; means I have a new struggle to come to terms with what they mean and
&gt; &gt; how they can be used.
&gt;
&gt;I devote a fair amount of informal discussion to the semantics of row
&gt;variables, and state their formal semantics explicitly.  How they are
&gt;used is illustrated throughout the document.

We do plan to provide more 'tutorial' material on row variables, 
however, in future documents. The idea is not actually very hard, but 
it is sometimes hard to *believe* until one gets used to it. Think 
about a normal variable ?x as standing for a single term, and a row 
variable @x as standing for any row of terms, ie something like t1 
.... tn, except that n might be zero. (Including the zero row is a 
technical device that makes things work better.)
