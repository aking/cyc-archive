SUO Group, and Incidentally Interested Observers, ...

I have tried to boil the larger morass of what I have left
to say to the Main SUO Body, all of that which I can't yet
extract from its infusion with the "Scope &amp; Purpose" (SAP),
down to a concentrated core of issues, all of which I have
tried to sum up in the subject line above.  Since the word
"interobjectivity" does not appear in the SUO SAP, I ought
to supply you with an explanation of its meaning and sense.

I have been wrestling for quite a while now with the words
"intercommunicability" and "interoperability".  The first
has always been implied in much of our effort, if more
in the breach than the realization, and the second is
explicitly incorporated into the SAP.  It is not just
the disfavor that I bear toward excessively long words,
or that fact that my tongue is not nimble enough to speak
them quickly in a single sentence, but it is the fact that
the twin concepts of intercommunication and interoperation,
in the presence of the pragmatic maxim, exist in what is
very near a verfiable identity, and so another word is
necessary in order to draw this intimate relation of
a single idea to itself out into the open and to
make its truth patent from the very setting out.

When I first saw these two-in-one notions mentioned in the SUO discussions,
I thought, wow, that's just what I've been working on my whole life, and I
imagined that I had finally come home again, but I should have known where
that line leads, and so I have come to have the lesson impressed on me yet
again that there is no royal road to any destiny beyond the world of dream.

But maybe it will help to fuse the two mettles into a single sword,
and fire them in the refractory flame of a sign relational furnace.
And this is what the word "interobjectivity" does, at least for me,
since the pragmatic usage of "object" covers "thing" and "purpose",
in deed, much in the way that modern physics eventually came to do,
it treats the ordinary sorts of physical objects that one tends to
think of first when anyone says the word "object" as being seconds
to the "deliberate orientations" (DO's) that we take up toward the
worlds that we construe as "outer" and even, occasionally, "inner".

But more on that, as time goes by.

Speaking of time gone by, there has been quite a lot of it since
I last attended to the threads on this loom, and so I will quote
what I was saying last time.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~LAST~TIME~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

I will try to stay focussed on my task, which is to explain
why all this fuss about "triadicity" that Peirceans make is
more than a just a tempest in their cozy little teapot, but
an aspect of turbulence on wider seas of being that we bold
and imaginative ontologists ought heed the warning signs of --
if you can wink at the dangling of that ominous preposition.

I hope that you will excuse me if I keep my meagre provision
of an outline at the ready -- though I would not bind myself
too fast to its mast, still fathom I must adjust its compass
as we go, especially as I venture into more uncharted waters,
where the fields of even our globe's own compass are regaled
to go completely haywire -- if you will excuse a superfluous
metaphor, if not an act of indiscriminal metonymy -- because
I fear that I would be lost, and may well perish, without it.

A.  What is this triadic relational POV, anyway?

It strikes me that the quickest way to set up the setting for this
particular crowd -- this prospective crew in part -- is to explain
it after the fashion of the design for a table, one that we should
find to serve us best in shaping all of our prospective discourses,
our plans, our quests from this day forth.  No, although it may be
round in some figurative sense, I am speaking quite literally here,
for once, if jest for the sake of novelty, so let us conjure up an
image of a brand of table that all of us will regard as one of the
most basely prosaic that we know, if not, indeed, the staple board
of our daily bread, a relational database table.

All that the 3-adic POV -- henceforth 3-POV -- asks of you is to
entertain the notion of adding another column to the 2-adic base
that all would agree is the minimum, "lowest common denominator",
if you will -- though of course you know the latter means a base
that is over our heads, being the Sup and Lub of our commonality --
that is, the smallest encompassing table of objects and of signs
that we would need to requisition in order to organize any shard
of significant discourse about most anything atoll -- if you can
excuse the shallow attempt to play on an isolated colloquialism.

Sounds simple enough, I know, especially in this day and age,
but even then, even now, with all of our intellectual luxury,
our training is such that we can't help but ask "Why bother?"

Well, many of the best reasons to bother have been before our faces --
some would say "in our faces", as the argot goes -- all of the time
that we motley crew have been animadly animadverting our animi here.
That brings me down -- indeed it does! -- no, I say down to Item 1a.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~EMIT~TSAL~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Okay, back to the feature, which I will try to keep
focussed on the synthetic topic of interobjectivity.

Probably I need to explain why I spent so much time going over the nitty-gritty details
of the "irreducibilty of triadics" (IOT) with Matthew West, to the point where I reckon
it should have almost been clear how inevitable 3-adic relations are in any analysis of
just about any significant phenomenon or reality, like our own human thinking processes
just for starters.  The fact is that most of us almost reflexively resort to a frame of
reference that was set out by Aristotle in his treatise 'On Interpretation', and I know
that maybe you think that not reading that work makes you free of it, but you know that
ignoring the roots of your automatic culture does not really achieve that kind of bliss.
From a POV that takes its stand in pragmatic thinking, the entire kit'n'kaboodle of the
western tradition since that time, if not before, has labored under the assumption of a
certain specialized approximation to the full structural potential of the sign relation,
to wit, the "standard operating principle" (SOP) that I dub "Aristotle's Approximation".
I have just spent the whole preceding decade duly and deliberately thinking and writing
about the logical implications and the practical consequences of clinging to this brand
of working assumption, and how it may be time to let go of it, for all the service that
it may have rendered us in the past, with respect to being able to think about anything
so complex as sign relations at all.  By the way, a bit of this work is accessible here:

<A  HREF="http://www.chss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html">http://www.chss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html</A>

<A  HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/integrat.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/integrat.htm</A>

Now, letting go of a 2500 year old habit is not an easy thing for a culture to do,
even an ostensibly "scientific" culture, especially a habit that is so habituated
that it takes a momentous effort of community-wide reflection just to observe its
sheer preveiling influence on the scene and off the scene of all that's ever seen.
Accordingly, as I have found out the hard way in the refractory medium of my very
own experience, it is only when people literally despair of patching together any
kind of genuine picture of the world from their bits of 2-dim snapshots that they
can even contemplate the idea of dropping this fiction of their inveterate belief.
Without exploding the fixed idea and the largely unconscious ideal that is formed
by Aristotle's Approximation, it is practically impossible to make any advance on
the slate of interobjectivity and all that we will likely do with our new fangled
media is to use them to rebottle one more time the same old brew in which we swim.

That is my plea for the relevance of pragmatic thinking to the SUO purpose.
It seemed like a good idea at the time -- and, well, I guess it still does.

Enough for now,

Jon Awbrey
