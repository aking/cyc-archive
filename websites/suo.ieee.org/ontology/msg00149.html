&gt; Thanks for the bibliographic correction in
&gt; your earlier note:  Elizabeth --&gt; Eleanor ... ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; But, on the main point, I think you are still drawing
&gt; a misleading parallelism.  In your note below, it seems
&gt; to me that you are equating the language of computer science
&gt; (a technical lexicon that is comparable to the lexicons of law,
&gt; business, cooking, etc.) with programming languages.  The language
&gt; of computer science is used by human beings to communicate with each
&gt; other.  A programming language is used by humans to instruct machines.
&gt; In my mind, at least, this is a significant ontological distinction.
&gt; One of the implications of this distinction is that polysemy is
&gt; much less acceptable in any programming language than it is
&gt; in any human-to-human language.

&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; I think that is a good way to put it:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do not know if this helps with your particular issue here,
&gt; &gt; but one of the ways that I tend to think of it from within
&gt; &gt; a pragmatic sign-theory framework is to index every sign
&gt; &gt; to the "community of interpretation" that employs it in
&gt; &gt; the way that it does.  As limiting and special cases,
&gt; &gt; of course, a "community" can be a single person or
&gt; &gt; even a machine.
&gt; 
&gt; The point I was trying to make in my note is
&gt; that there is no major difference between the
&gt; way that multiple word senses arise in natural
&gt; languages and the way they arise in various
&gt; technical/scientific/artificial/programming
&gt; languages.
&gt; 
&gt; Wittgenstein used the term "language game" for the way some community
&gt; uses a word in some pattern of behavior.  The kinds of language games
&gt; that occur in computer science are of the same nature as the games
&gt; that are played in engineering, science, business, cooking, law,
&gt; economics, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I used the word "culture" to describe the origin of the multiple word senses.
&gt; But of course, every culture arises from the traditional practices in some
&gt; community (but I agree with Wittgenstein that a community should at least
&gt; have two members -- a family is a typical minimal example).
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, I would define "culture" as the hypostatic abstraction of a
&gt; community's semiotic games (including language games as a special case).

Doug, John, &amp; All,

A couple of points:

Taking the view from a historical perspective -- The Horror! The Horror! --
what we now call "programming languages" can be seen to have developed
in the following way:  A program ("a writ before") is a certain order
of "effective description", for instance, the likes of all of these:
an algorithm, a certification, a civil order, an epitome, a formula,
an imperial decree, a judicial injunction, a papal order, a pithy maxim,
a poem ("the words that do"), a prescription, a protocol ("glued up front"),
a recapitulation, a receipt, a recipe, a specification, a summons, a warrant
for the arrest of a named or a specified person (with all of the "halting"
problems that ensue upon its putative execution), a writ of habeas corpus,
or a writ of mandamus, in effect, a simple sort of injunctive or instructive
description that a chemist, a cleric, a clerk, a computer, a cook, or a cop --
job descriptions that were all of them originally filled by human, all too
human executors and interpreters -- can pick out their own ways to follow.

From this long view, it is something of an incidental side-effect that
a particular "genre or motif of very effective descriptions" (GOMOVED's),
as were writ by "formal or logical or mathematical executors" (FOLOME's)
in the Mid-Twentieth Century, constituted such maximally simple-minded
maxims that even the likes of a machine could be made to follow them
more or less faithfully.

More or less -- Ay, there's the rub, and the friction thereof!

I forget my other point ...

Maybe later,

Jon Awbrey
