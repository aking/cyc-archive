&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew, 
&gt; 	.		You have taken me at odds with my 
&gt; intention. I agree
&gt; with all you have said below. 

&gt; 
&gt; 	.	The point I was trying to make was that the 
&gt; extent of the
&gt; linguistic structure we have in the SUO language at any point 
&gt; in time should
&gt; be as far as we can expect it to be able to express. Whenever 
&gt; we want to
&gt; say, in that language, anything beyond it, we need to extend 
&gt; the language. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	What you are talking about is what we say about 
&gt; it in our
&gt; discussions about the topic in English, rather than what we 
&gt; express in the
&gt; SUO language. Obviously we can say far more in English, as 
&gt; its had a far
&gt; more comprehensive development history. 

MW: Understood. I was always talking about how we said things in English.
Once we say things in KIF things become more formal, but in how we talk
about things it is very difficult to be unambiguous.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	John can correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect 
&gt; he was also
&gt; referring to what is expressed in the SUO language when he made the
&gt; statement, rather than what we say about it in English. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	The two types of discussion are, of course, entirely
&gt; different.

&gt; &gt; Martin, 
&gt; &gt; 	.	Thanks for this further clarification. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	.	Further responses interspersed below, prefaced 
&gt; &gt; "GH&gt;	".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	.	Incidentally, I should say that I agree absolutely with
&gt; &gt; Matthew's:
&gt; &gt; *	assumption of "naive realism"; 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: For the record, this was John Sowa rather than me. 
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree, and am much more in sympathy (I imagine) with Jon 
&gt; on this. In my
&gt; view it is important in our discussions at least to be able 
&gt; to talk about
&gt; both the real world and our representation of it, and 
&gt; distinguish between
&gt; these two. Finally it becomes useful to be able to talk about our
&gt; represenntations of the real world as being part of the real 
&gt; world and to
&gt; understand their place in it, although this latter is an 
&gt; advanced topic that
&gt; can be left to later.
&gt; 
&gt; In particular I think we need to be able to talk about the 
&gt; real world on the
&gt; one hand, and its nature and structure, and how we represent 
&gt; that in some
&gt; ontology with some concept and its structure, and discuss whether the
&gt; structure of the concept is a good reflection of the 
&gt; structure of the real
&gt; world object. Because fundamentally I agree with Jon when he says:
&gt; 
&gt; "&lt;a,b,c&gt;" signifies &lt;a,b,c&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; But that isn't necessarily what people mean.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and that 
&gt; &gt; *	if (SUO-)KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it; 
&gt; &gt; but with the
&gt; &gt; rider that 
&gt; &gt; *	SUO-KIF is progressively extended to accommodate such conceptual
&gt; &gt; areas. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	.	This is how language necessarily developed, and 
&gt; &gt; is a common
&gt; &gt; sense approach to the task.

&gt; &gt;  &lt;&lt;Mac Word 3.0&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Note from Graham Horn wrote with comments from Martin King inserted.
&gt; &gt; Martin, John, etc.,
&gt; &gt; .              This looks like solid progress.
&gt; &gt; MK&gt; Delighted you think so
&gt; &gt; .    The ideas of having "generic relationship concept" 
&gt; &gt; ("relationship type"
&gt; &gt; in normal data modelling parlance), and "relationship 
&gt; instance" (just
&gt; &gt; "relationship" in normal data modelling parlance) make good 
&gt; &gt; sense, and fit
&gt; &gt; in well with the normal data modelling terminology many 
&gt; &gt; people use. It does,
&gt; &gt; however, mean that the traditional "entity - relationship 
&gt; &gt; diagram (ERD)" now
&gt; &gt; becomes an "entity - relationship type diagram".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MK&gt;  I believe the most natural interpretation of most ERD 
&gt; diagramming
&gt; &gt; conventions each graphic element coresponds with something 
&gt; at the type
&gt; &gt; level.  This a typical context in which this is so obvious, 
&gt; &gt; that nobody
&gt; &gt; bothers to qualify the word relationship (or the word entity) 
&gt; &gt; with the word
&gt; &gt; type.  So ERD always has meant "entity type - relationship 
&gt; &gt; type diagram",
&gt; &gt; but we did not bother to say so, and I suggest can still 
&gt; &gt; leave it implied by
&gt; &gt; the context..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	I understand perfectly where you are coming from. However, It is
&gt; &gt; pretty well exactly this sort of assumed obviousness that 
&gt; led to this
&gt; &gt; thread. What we need to come up with for the SUO standard, 
&gt; as with any
&gt; &gt; international standard, is language that says EVERYTHING 
&gt; &gt; explicitly (or
&gt; &gt; refers the reader to another standard, or possibly other 
&gt; &gt; reference document,
&gt; &gt; that does). The whole point of a standard is that someone of normal
&gt; &gt; intelligence can read and understand and apply it reliably. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	This is why I asked for proposed wordings for these definitions
&gt; &gt; below, in my previous e-mail. I didn't want to propose them 
&gt; &gt; myself, as I am
&gt; &gt; not an expert on the logical language perspective, as your reply
&gt; &gt; demonstrates. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; .    The third item looks to me like "the set of all instances of a
&gt; &gt; relationship having the nominated "generic relationship 
&gt; &gt; concept". I take it
&gt; &gt; this is what is proposed for "relation".
&gt; &gt; MK&gt; Yes and no.  Yes because it is at the population level.  
&gt; &gt; No because the
&gt; &gt; most natural interpretation of Relation as used by Codd, 
&gt; &gt; Sowa, etc. is that
&gt; &gt; it refers to representation rather than the thing in the real 
&gt; &gt; world being
&gt; &gt; represented.  Matthew rightly identified that I had left this 
&gt; &gt; important
&gt; &gt; distinction out of my earlier note.  To make this as clear as 
&gt; &gt; possible I
&gt; &gt; have to use tables, and as these are likely to be distorted 
&gt; &gt; in message text,
&gt; &gt; I attach them as a Word document.(See attached file: A domain of
&gt; &gt; discourse.doc)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	The concept that Jon Awbrey has made much of, of the triadic
&gt; &gt; relation(ship?) between object, mental concept of object, and 
&gt; &gt; symbol for
&gt; &gt; object, which seems to be what you are referring to here, 
&gt; &gt; makes a lot of
&gt; &gt; sense. It shouldn't be too difficult to get some simple 
&gt; description to
&gt; &gt; accommodate this. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	I have looked at your tables below, and feel they need some
&gt; &gt; refinement and/or elaboration to give precise meaning. For 
&gt; &gt; example, in a
&gt; &gt; database like this one would normally have a table of customers,
&gt; &gt; representing the entity "customer", with information about 
&gt; &gt; them, such as
&gt; &gt; address, contact number, etc. One could have another table of 
&gt; &gt; suppliers,
&gt; &gt; representing the entity "supplier", similarly with 
&gt; &gt; information about them,
&gt; &gt; such as address, contact number, etc. Neither table 
&gt; &gt; necessarily contains
&gt; &gt; relationships. One would probably have a relationship of type (say)
&gt; &gt; "commerce" or "consumer complaint" between these two entities. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	If the relationship were "one-to-many", one would have 
&gt; &gt; one of the
&gt; &gt; columns present in both tables, so as to enable 
&gt; &gt; identification of which
&gt; &gt; supplier related to which customer. That column could list 
&gt; court case
&gt; &gt; reference numbers in a consumer claims tribunal. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	If the relationship were "many-to-many" , one would 
&gt; &gt; require a link
&gt; &gt; table containing at least one of the columns from each of the 
&gt; &gt; supplier and
&gt; &gt; customer tables, so as to enable identification in each row of which
&gt; &gt; supplier related to which customer. Other columns in this 
&gt; &gt; link table would
&gt; &gt; provide other information about the particular relationship 
&gt; &gt; between the
&gt; &gt; supplier and customer in each row. The link table may be 
&gt; &gt; (much) smaller or
&gt; &gt; (much) larger than either of the two tables joined by the 
&gt; &gt; relationship. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	When one takes this sort of situation into account, 
&gt; &gt; perhaps you can
&gt; &gt; see why the distinctions between "relationship" and 
&gt; "relation" are not
&gt; &gt; nearly so clear from what you have said so far. They aren't 
&gt; &gt; even true for
&gt; &gt; one-to-many relationships. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	I suspect a lot of work will be needed to get such items in the
&gt; &gt; terminology defined in clear and unambiguous ways. Meanwhile, 
&gt; &gt; those of us
&gt; &gt; who don't have the background covering those meanings remain at a
&gt; &gt; significant disadvantage in trying to come to grips with key 
&gt; &gt; aspects of the
&gt; &gt; logic being valuably added to the SUO. It also makes it 
&gt; &gt; difficult for us to
&gt; &gt; explain the things we see as currently inadequate in it. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	Whatever the outcome, by the time the SUO gets to be a draft
&gt; &gt; standard, it would be highly preferable that any diagrammatic 
&gt; &gt; tables and/or
&gt; &gt; examples be also backed up by simple sentences with clear meanings
&gt; &gt; explaining the situation. The tables and/or examples should 
&gt; be back-up
&gt; &gt; material rather than the primary means of explication. I am 
&gt; certainly
&gt; &gt; prepared to provide suggestions for improving the clarity of 
&gt; &gt; proposals (or
&gt; &gt; else exemplifying the susceptibilities for misinterpretation 
&gt; &gt; by people with
&gt; &gt; different backgrounds). 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; .    If I am understanding this correctly, then the "generic 
&gt; &gt; relationship
&gt; &gt; concept" (or "relationship type") will be the same as the 
&gt; &gt; "generic relation
&gt; &gt; concept" (or "relation type"). Is this intended?
&gt; &gt; .    Can anyone:
&gt; &gt; *	come up with improved (clearer &amp; more succinct) wordings for the
&gt; &gt; definitions? and
&gt; &gt; *	provide examples with -arity = 1 and -arity &gt; 3?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; .    I ask this because I believe we should have good solid 
&gt; simple and
&gt; &gt; unambiguous definitions that leave nothing to be puzzled over 
&gt; &gt; or guessed at.
&gt; &gt; .    I would prefer that the SUO terminology is compatible with data
&gt; &gt; modelling paradigm as much as possible. I say this in view of 
&gt; &gt; the amount of
&gt; &gt; database development undertaken these days, using such 
&gt; &gt; ordinary "Office"
&gt; &gt; software products as MS Access and Lotus Approach, which most 
&gt; &gt; people have on
&gt; &gt; their work and home computers.
&gt; &gt; .    This also seems appropriate to me since the SUO scope 
&gt; &gt; includes: "This
&gt; &gt; standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable 
&gt; computers to
&gt; &gt; utilize it for applications such as data interoperability, 
&gt; information
&gt; &gt; search and retrieval, .......".
&gt; &gt; .    The purpose is also heavily data centric, as can be seen below.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ===========================================
&gt; &gt; Revised Scope as at 25 Nov '00 (Jim, are these the latest?):
&gt; &gt; This standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable 
&gt; &gt; computers to
&gt; &gt; utilize it for applications such as data interoperability, 
&gt; information
&gt; &gt; search and retrieval, automated inferencing, and natural language
&gt; &gt; processing. An ontology is similar to a dictionary or 
&gt; &gt; glossary, but with
&gt; &gt; greater detail and structure that enables computers to 
&gt; &gt; process its content.
&gt; &gt; An ontology consists of a set of concepts, axioms, and 
&gt; &gt; relationships that
&gt; &gt; describe a domain of interest. An upper ontology is limited 
&gt; &gt; to concepts that
&gt; &gt; are meta-, generic, abstract and philosophical, and therefore 
&gt; &gt; are general
&gt; &gt; enough to address (at a high level) a broad range of domain 
&gt; &gt; areas. Concepts
&gt; &gt; specific to given domains will not be included; however, this 
&gt; &gt; standard will
&gt; &gt; provide a structure and a set of general concepts upon which domain
&gt; &gt; ontologies (e.g. medical, financial, engineering, etc.) could be
&gt; &gt; constructed.
&gt; &gt; Purpose: (Why the standard needs to be developed and who will 
&gt; &gt; benefit.)
&gt; &gt; A.	AUTOMATED REASONING: The standard will be suitable for automated
&gt; &gt; logical inference to support knowledge-based reasoning applications.
&gt; &gt; B.	INTER-OPERABILITY: The standard will provide a basis 
&gt; &gt; for achieving
&gt; &gt; Inter-Operability among various software and database applications.
&gt; &gt; 1)	Application developers can define new data elements in 
&gt; &gt; terms of a
&gt; &gt; common ontology, and thereby gain some degree of 
&gt; &gt; interoperability with other
&gt; &gt; conformant systems.
&gt; &gt; 2)	Applications based on domain-specific ontologies that 
&gt; &gt; are compliant
&gt; &gt; with this standard will be able to interoperate (to some 
&gt; &gt; degree) by virtue
&gt; &gt; of the shared common terms and definitions.
&gt; &gt; 3)	The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange 
&gt; &gt; format whereby
&gt; &gt; owners of existing applications will be able to map existing 
&gt; &gt; data elements
&gt; &gt; just once to a common ontology. This provides a degree of 
&gt; &gt; interoperability
&gt; &gt; with other applications whose representations conform to SUO. 
&gt; &gt;  This entails
&gt; &gt; the SUO being able to be mapped to more restricted forms 
&gt; such as XML,
&gt; &gt; database schema, or object oriented schema.
&gt; &gt; C: APPLICATION AREAS
&gt; &gt; 1)	E-commerce applications from different domains that need to
&gt; &gt; interoperate at both the data and semantic levels.
&gt; &gt; 2)	Educational applications in which students learn concepts and
&gt; &gt; relationships directly from, or expressed in terms of, a 
&gt; &gt; common ontology.
&gt; &gt; This will also enable a standard record of learning to be kept.
&gt; &gt; 3)	Natural language understanding tasks in which a knowledge based
&gt; &gt; reasoning system uses the ontology to disambiguate among likely
&gt; &gt; interpretations of natural language statements.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A domain of discourse
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first table attempts to clarify six concepts respecting 
&gt; &gt; distinctions
&gt; &gt; between Representation and Real World and between type, instance and
&gt; &gt; population.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	Representation	Real World	
&gt; &gt; Type	1. The definition of a table including its columns and 
&gt; &gt; meaning	2.
&gt; &gt; The concept of customer	
&gt; &gt; Instance	3. A row in a table	4. A particular customer of a
&gt; &gt; particular trader	
&gt; &gt; Population	5. A table of rows and columns with values	6. A
&gt; &gt; population of customers of one or more traders	
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A table of terms for referring to the domain of discourse.  
&gt; &gt; Each term in the
&gt; &gt; table below, which is congruent with the one above, should be 
&gt; &gt; interpreted as
&gt; &gt; referring to the content of the corresponding cell in the 
&gt; table above.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 			
&gt; &gt; 	1. ?	2. Relationship [type]	
&gt; &gt; 	3. Tuple	4. Relationship [instance]	
&gt; &gt; 	5. Relation	6. ?	
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe this use of Tuple and Relation is consistent with 
&gt; &gt; Ted Codd, John
&gt; &gt; Sowa, and John Velman.  I believe the use of relationship is 
&gt; &gt; consistent with
&gt; &gt; natural language.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would welcome suggestions for terms to replace the question 
&gt; &gt; marks, though
&gt; &gt; I cannot think of any strong candidates in spite of many 
&gt; &gt; years of experience
&gt; &gt; of discussion of this issue.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem is the risk of confusion, when one of the terms 
&gt; &gt; is used to refer
&gt; &gt; to either of the concepts with question marks.  In my 
&gt; &gt; experience this can
&gt; &gt; usually be avoided by rephrasing the statement to use other  
&gt; &gt; terms so the
&gt; &gt; distinctions are respected.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I strongly support what John Sowa has to say here.
&gt; &gt; I will just add a reply to Matthew that in my mind my words 
&gt; &gt; describing the
&gt; &gt; three concepts were based on the naive realism assumption to 
&gt; &gt; refer to the
&gt; &gt; real world as far as is possible.  I can see how they can be 
&gt; &gt; interpreted as
&gt; &gt; referring to representations of the real world, but I 
&gt; &gt; recommend avoiding
&gt; &gt; this.  I would also point out that John Velman's response to my
&gt; &gt; contribution, although in some sense was a useful paraphrase 
&gt; &gt; of my words, in
&gt; &gt; fact has moved strongly to referring to the representation 
&gt; &gt; rather than the
&gt; &gt; real world.  I show extracts of both below for comparison.
&gt; &gt; Bottom line (in NL at least, but I think SUO/KIF too)) is try 
&gt; &gt; to write as if
&gt; &gt; it is the real world is the referent, even the way you have 
&gt; &gt; to write it is
&gt; &gt; predicated on a particular style of representation.  This may 
&gt; &gt; sound like a
&gt; &gt; "cop out", but for me it is more a "sleight of hand" that works.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. A generic relationship concept (e.g. Customer), sometimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; called relationship type
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A specific instance of a relationship concept (e.g. Martin
&gt; &gt; &gt; King is a customer of Singapore Airlines)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. A population of relationship instances (e.g. all customers
&gt; &gt; &gt; of Singapore Airlines), close to the concept of class
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; A relation of arity n, n&gt;0,  is symbolized as predicate with 
&gt; &gt; n arguments.
&gt; &gt; The extension of a relation of arity 1 is the set of things 
&gt; &gt; in the domain of
&gt; &gt; quantification for which the predicate is true.  The  extension of a
&gt; &gt; relation of arity n&gt;1 is the subset of the n-fold Cartesian 
&gt; &gt; product of the
&gt; &gt; domain of quantification for which the predicate is true.
&gt; &gt; A relationship is an instance of a relation.    E.g.,  married(X,Y)
&gt; &gt; describes a relation. married(Bill, Hillary) describes a 
&gt; relationship.

Matthew, Mike, et al.,
That is a very serious and very difficult question:
&gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we
&gt;call what it is in the real world that they refer to?

As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box of metaphysical
problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and realists can talk together quite
happily as long as they use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can
also work together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and other
formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C, Java, etc.
But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they refer to in the
real world?" all hell breaks loose.
You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?  what is
reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?
Suggestion:
1.	These philosophical issues, despite their perennial interest, have
never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?) satisfaction.  Of one thing we
can be absolutely certain is that they will not be solved on this mailing
list.
2.	Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the purpose of
the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive realism" that says that the
world exists, and most of the words we use in ordinary language refer to
something, but let's not worry too much about what it is.
3.	For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt the
position that KIF is the official language to be used for everything that
can be officially expressed by the SUO.  If KIF can't express it, we don't
talk about it.

I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out" that
doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the same cop out that
Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his Tractatus:  "Everything that
can be said can be said clearly, and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we
must be silent."
For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some extra
prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in the SUO] can be
said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot speak [in KIF], thereof we must
be silent.
This is not an answer to the question of what do relations really refer to.
It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the only kind of cop out that will
allow us to get some work done.
John Sowa
