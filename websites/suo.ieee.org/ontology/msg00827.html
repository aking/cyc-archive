&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My only addition is a suggestion that we use KIF
&gt; &gt; as the base language of signs for the purpose of
&gt; &gt; the SUO, and we define the terms in other languages,
&gt; &gt; such as English, conceptual graphs, etc., by their
&gt; &gt; translation to KIF.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, I repeat my earlier caveat:  This proposal does
&gt; &gt; not solve any philosophical problems, it doesn't answer
&gt; &gt; any linguistic questions, and it makes no claim that KIF
&gt; &gt; is the best language for everything that one might want
&gt; &gt; to use a language for.  But it allows the work on the
&gt; &gt; SUO to proceed.

&gt;John,
&gt;
&gt;KIF, in the shape that we currently know it, and, for that matter,
&gt;most of the popular systems for expressing FOL, are not languages
&gt;that I can think in, for the reason that they preclude me, either
&gt;through their deliberate inexpressiveness or their computational
&gt;inefficiency, from being able to address the research issues that
&gt;are of pressing concern and present interest to me, like whether
&gt;the functional (procedural) and the logical (declarative) aspects
&gt;of computational (in the broadest sense) languages can be better
&gt;integrated than they currently are, just to name a single issue
&gt;that leaps to mind.

Jon, first let me thank you for expressing yourself with such 
clarity.  But to turn to the substance, I wonder what kind of 
limitation you find in KIF? KIF 3.0 (not ANSI-KIF, or the SUO-KIF 
core, both of which are highly stripped down to their simplest 
basics) must be one of the most expressive formal languages ever 
defined. It is capable of describing its own syntax (like LISP), it 
has the strongest consistent truth-predicate I have ever seen, it has 
upward and downward reflection. What more can you possibly want? 
(Higher-order quantifiers? Type theory?) I concede that it might not 
be the most elegant language (although trying to do better has given 
me a lot more respect for it: designing elegant languages isn't an 
easy task), but you don't criticise it on aesthetic grounds. And for 
a Peircian, surely it's having been aligned with CG's must give it 
some brownie points.

You say you are interested in integrating functional and declarative 
aspects of languages, which is also a central interest of mine. Even 
here, KIF is worthy of a little careful study (although this goes way 
beyond what is needed for the SUO enterprise, I believe). For 
example, KIF 3.0 has a basic semantic flaw which makes it not 
strictly first-order; it assumes that sequences are finite, a 
constraint which is not first-order expressible. But notice that this 
assumption *is* expressible in the usual fixed-point semantics for 
recursive programming languages, and would indeed validate the many 
'recursive' definitions in the KIF 3.0 manual. So it seems to me that 
KIF might indeed be a very good tree to try climbing in order to get 
at this particular kind of research fruit. Can one give it a 
semantics which somehow combines what one wants of the assertional 
expressive power of a quantified logic with some the recursive power 
of a functional programming language? How? I honestly do not know, 
but I think it would be well worth careful study. Suppose one could: 
what then would happen to the self-description abilities of KIF, in 
the light of this new semantics?

&gt; Why would I want to be a part of building
&gt;a language that I myself would not use, could not use for any
&gt;significant purpose under the sun?  Why would I want to sell
&gt;to others, to impose on others, a language that they will
&gt;have so much trouble, with mechanized help or otherwise,
&gt;using to think?

Can you tell us HOW this language is hampering our thinking, in your 
view? Or what sort of language might be less hampering? I might be a 
lost cause, of course, having been thinking in, and about, FOL most 
of my adult life.

&gt;I never know where any language might be capable of going over time,
&gt;and so the only features that I see worth criticizing in FOL or KIF
&gt;are the features that would keep them cast in stone, fixed in place,
&gt;or rooted to the spots that they currently inhabit.

Well, its true that the *language* doesnt have any intrinsic 
machinery for changing itself (although it is possible, in principle, 
to express in KIF's metatheory axioms which, when added to a 
knowledge base, will extend the set of forms recognisable by the 
parser. But I would have to agree with anyone who would say this 
wasnt a very practical device.) But the *ontology* expressed in the 
language is capable of being extended and modified, and this is I 
think where the SUO effort should be focussed. The particular 
language used in not in itself of deep importance, provided that it 
has a certain basic expressive power: one can write translators 
between various ontology languages.
