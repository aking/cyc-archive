Dear John,

&gt; Matthew and Lee,
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with Lee's response:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The "triadic" issue in the example you have given is whether we can
&gt; &gt;analyze this example into triads which add up to the whole 
&gt; picture without
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;any loss of logical content.  In listing the attributes of 
&gt; the measurement
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;problem you have already done this, if we can show that each 
&gt; element of
&gt; &gt;the problem-- time of observation, measurement device, 
&gt; measurement scale,
&gt; &gt;place of observation, observing subject, observed object etc.-- is
&gt; &gt;reducible to the pattern O(for object)-R(for representamen)-I (for
&gt; &gt;interpretant), where any R can also be seen as an O for some further
&gt; &gt;O-R-I, and any I can be seen as an O or R for some further 
&gt; O-R-I, and any
&gt; &gt;O may also be an R or an I, and so on, this whole business being the
&gt; &gt;continuum of semiosis, infinitely extendable and infinitesimally
&gt; &gt;refinable.
&gt; 
&gt; to Matthew's question:

MW: except that is not the answer to the question I was asking. If I am
satisfied that any arbitrary relation can be decomposed into binary
relations
I am hardly going to be questioning simply whether they can be decomposed
into
ternary relations.

MW: The issue is more a follow up on your interchange with Pat where the
discussion turned to lambda expressions with at least 3 variables. At that
time
you left it open as to whether there might be expressions with more than 3 
variables. It seems to me that reducing relations to triadic rather than
dyadic
form is a somewhat arbitrary choice unless there is some substance behind
it.
This substance is what I am pursuing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;... John has not responded to this example, which I repeat below.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; MW: OK. In that case please show me how a measurement can be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reduced to triads. A Measurement is an activity that:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; has a subject (the thing measured)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an observer (doing the measuring)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an instrument (e.g. thermometer)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a measure (what about the thing is being measured, e.g. 
&gt; temperature)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a result (the value e.g. 20)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a Unit of Measure (e.g. Celsius)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the time when the measurement was taken.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I would be interested to see whether and how this can be 
&gt; reduced to triadic
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; or less ontologically dependent elements. If it can't, 
&gt; then there is at
&gt; &gt;&gt; least one case where this does not apply (which is enough) 
&gt; &gt;&gt;or perhaps as Pat
&gt; &gt;&gt; has been suggesting there has been confusion between graph 
&gt; &gt;&gt;theory and ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; The word "measurement" is ambiguous, since it can refer to
&gt; either the result (a sign) or the process (called "semiosis").

MW: Here I refer to the activity of making an observation and noting
the result.

&gt; As Lee has said, this act of semiosis can be represented as
&gt; a triangle, which relates other signs (such as the marks
&gt; on a thermometer) to a sign that serves as a standard unit
&gt; to a number, which serves as a sign of the count of units
&gt; that represent the result.  

MW: Oh I thought that a unit of measure was a particular mapping
between a type of characteristic (say temperature) and a number space.
I don't see how signs get into it, except as representations of the 
mapping.

&gt; The activity of measuring is in
&gt; some situation (another triad) that relates the space-time
&gt; region to the activity taking place in that region.
&gt; 
MW: Now here you lost me. I can see that temperature has a 
relationship to activity, but not for instance mass. Or are
you sticking to temperature (not the easiest example).

MW: Taking some particular example would be a good way to 
explore this. Probably a length of some sort would be simplest.

&gt; The reason why I did not respond quickly is that doing all
&gt; the analysis and drawing all the triangles would take some
&gt; time.  

MW: I can appreciate that - but you didn't mention you intended to
come back either.

&gt; But to illustrate the kind of diagram I would draw,
&gt; if I took the time, see Section 2, "Signs of Signs", in my
&gt; paper "Ontology, Metadata, and Semiotics":
&gt; 
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ontometa.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ontometa.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; For another point of view, I suggest the lectures by
&gt; Joseph Esposito:
&gt; 
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/epc/srb/cyber/espout.html">http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/epc/srb/cyber/espout.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Following is the abstract of his lectures (which are all
&gt; available on line).
&gt; 
&gt; John Sowa
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Peirce's Theory of Semiosis:
&gt; Toward a Logic of Mutual Affection
&gt; 
&gt; Instructor: Joseph L. Esposito
&gt; 
&gt; Course Description
&gt; 
&gt; This is a course on the development of Peirce's theory of 
&gt; signs (semiotics),
&gt; focusing on various writings of Peirce in
&gt; more or less chronological order. Just about as soon as 
&gt; Peirce began to philosophize
&gt; he was using the concept of a 'sign'
&gt; to help clarify his thoughts. The course begins with the 
&gt; philosophical tradition
&gt; Peirce as a young Harvard student
&gt; inherited and ends with our own speculations on Peirce's 
&gt; legacy. Our study is
&gt; guided by the concept of reciprocity in
&gt; Peirce's thought. Our aim is to attain a more philosophically 
&gt; refined understanding
&gt; of the concept and at the same time
&gt; acquire a deeper appreciation of Peirce's semiotics, and 
&gt; semiosis as a form
&gt; of reciprocity, as we review the various
&gt; formulations of the concept in his work. In refining the 
&gt; concept of reciprocity
&gt; illustrations of working uses of the concept
&gt; in a variety of disciplines will be sought for analysis and 
&gt; reflection. Thus,
&gt; the course will function as a true community
&gt; of inquirers believed by Peirce to be best way for knowledge 
&gt; to increase.
&gt; 

MW: I really don't have much problem with signs and their 
importance. The work of ISO TC184/SC4 has historically been to
a great extent about CAD drawings, and it is fairly fundamental
that CAD drawings both are something in their own right, but that
they represent something else.

MW: What I am not sure about is what semiotics has to do with
reducing a complex activity to triadic form.

MW: What it seems to me is that you (and perhaps other Peirceans)
have developed a particular style of analysis that you find useful,
rather than some fundamental truth. On the other hand, I and others
have developed a different style of analysis for which I claim no
more than that it has proved useful in practice. 

MW: For me it would be useful to distinguish between what is fundamental
and what has proved useful, aiming to discover the first, and 
appreciate the second.
