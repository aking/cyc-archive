Hi Matthew

&lt;snip&gt;......
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Obviously the interesting case is where they are referring to
&gt; &gt; different concepts. But the difficult case is where A's concept
&gt; &gt; cannot even be expressed in B's overall ontological framework, and
&gt; &gt; vice versa.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Surely if this is the case then the concepts are disjoint, and the
&gt;concepts for which this is the case can be ignored as out of scope of the
&gt;other ontology. Of course this argument does not apply if the ontology is
&gt;supposed to be an ontology of everything. In this case, not being able to
&gt;express another ontology means that you have not succeeded yet, and you have
&gt;some work to do, which may include changing your view of the world (as has
&gt;happened to me).

You seem to be confusing the world itself with a way of looking at 
the world. There is only one world ( let us hope so, anyway) , but 
that one world might admit of several different forms of conceptual 
description.  One can have two distinct 'ontologies of everything' 
which are both 'of everything' in the world, but which do not include 
one another's categories. Part of what I am arguing is that there is 
no useful sense of an 'ontology of everything' which includes all 
ways of conceptualising the world.

&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: Having said that I would be quite interested in what you
&gt; &gt; thought was the
&gt; &gt; &gt;difference between a continuant and a space-time history.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It took me a while to follow this myself, having been used to
&gt; &gt; thinking in a 4-d way for about 20 years now. The distinction (which
&gt; &gt; I learned from Peter Simons) is roughly as follows. In the
&gt; &gt; continuant/occurent way of thinking, one refers to existence *at a
&gt; &gt; time*. This means that the four-dimensional entities simply do not
&gt; &gt; exist in this ontology. A continuant is something which continues to
&gt; &gt; exist through time and retains its identity through time, and is such
&gt; &gt; that (this is the characterising property) all its parts are present
&gt; &gt; whenever it is present. Thus a person is a continuant, since if I am
&gt; &gt; here then all my parts are here (now), while a race, say, is not a
&gt; &gt; continuant - it is in fact an occurrent - since it has parts which
&gt; &gt; are temporally distinguished: it has a beginning, a middle and an
&gt; &gt; end. The distinction is like that between a person (a continuant) and
&gt; &gt; that person's life (an occurrent).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Both occurrents and continuants 'map' into 4-d entities in the 4-d
&gt; &gt; histories ontology, but there is no principled way there to
&gt; &gt; distinguish them. The nearest you can get is to say that continuants
&gt; &gt; have isotemporal parts while occurents have isospatial parts,
&gt;
&gt;MW: There are two key questions to ask when you are mapping into a different
&gt;ontology:
&gt;
&gt;1. What sort(s) of thing is this in the ontology I am mapping into?
&gt;2. How do I distinguish the objects in the ontology I am mapping into that
&gt;map back into my source ontology?
&gt;
&gt;You seem to have answered the first of these here, and  good go at the
&gt;second.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; but in
&gt; &gt; the 4-d histories ontology one can cut 'parts' any way one chooses,
&gt; &gt; including along boundaries which slant in time (i.e. which are
&gt; &gt; 'moving', as someone who thinks non-4-dimensionally would say.)
&gt;
&gt;MW: Quite, this is part of what makes it so powerful.

I agree, but this cost comes at a price. There are more kinds of 
'thing' in the 4-d ontology, and so we need much more powerful ways 
of distinguishing them and describing their relationships. In my old 
paper on liquids I noted that there are two alternative ways to 
individuate liquid-containing histories (pieces of liquid, which 
move, vs. liquid objects, through which liquids can move; a river is 
a liquid object, the cofffee in my cup right now is a piece of 
liquid) and we need both kinds in order to perform reasonably 
sophisticated reasoning. These histories intersect momentarily and 
then separate, unlike the histories of 'solid' things with nice sharp 
boundaries. I mention this only to indicate that there are issues 
about how to distinguish one history from another which do not have 
simple, elegant, answers. The intuitive topology of 4-d spacetime is 
much more complicated than that of what might be called 3.5-d 
space+time.

&gt; &gt; And
&gt; &gt; the defining criteria for the distinction in the other ontology is
&gt; &gt; literally incoherent in the 4-d ontology, since *nothing* is such
&gt; &gt; that all its parts are present whenever it is present: the 'whenever'
&gt; &gt; here is meaningless in the 4d ontology.
&gt;
&gt;MW: You lost me here. This sentence does not seem to follow from anything.

I'll try again. The point is that in the continuant/occurent 
framework, there is a conceptual distinction between a person (for 
example) and that same person's history.  The second is something 
which is extended through time, and has earlier and later parts: it 
can be naturally mapped into the 4-d ontology; it is what I called a 
'history' in my naive physics papers and what Fritz Lehmann calls a 
'worm'. The first, however, simply cannot be described in the 4-d 
ontology. It is something which only exists at a time (like a 
temporal slice through a history) but which is the same thing from 
one time to the next (unlike a temporal slice through a history). You 
will indeed have trouble imagining this if you insist on thinking of 
things in the 4-dimensional framework, since it is impossible in that 
framework. Nevertheless it seems to be useful notion, and one that 
corresponds to a common distinction in natural language and in 
ordinary reasoning. We commonly think of ourselves as being the same 
person we were yesterday (though with different properties) and 
simultaneously think of ourselves as wholly present at any given 
instant.

One can draw different conclusions from this idea. One possible 
conclusion is that the 4-d ontology is perfect and that this notion 
is therefore incoherent; another, I think more reasonable, conclusion 
is that this concept has its uses, but only in a fundamentally 
different ontological framework than the 4-d one. From which it 
follows that the 4-d ontological framework is not in fact the 
'universal' framework that you seem to think it is.

(One way to make the distinction is to think of two kinds of history: 
one kind 'breaks up' into pieces along time-like boundaries, the 
other along space-like boundaries. The problem now for the 4-d 
ontology is that two of these can occupy exactly the same region of 
space-time, yet be conceptually distinct. Maybe your 4-d ontology can 
handle this: my one couldn't.)

&gt; &gt; As evidence for the idea of a continuant in intuitive thinking,
&gt; &gt; consider the claim that I am the same person I was 10 years ago. This
&gt; &gt; is literally false in the 4-d ontology (it can be expressed there by
&gt; &gt; saying that me-now and me-1990 are both slices of the me-history, but
&gt; &gt; that raises the question of what distinguishes one history from
&gt; &gt; another, since these are also both slices of completely unrelated
&gt; &gt; histories) Statements like this seem to depend on the idea of
&gt; &gt; something retaining its identity through time, even though its
&gt; &gt; properties may change. This 'locus of identity' is what constitutes
&gt; &gt; the basic idea of a continuant, I think.
&gt;
&gt;MW: You seem to be very concerned about how concepts are expressed. I have a
&gt;simpler test as to whether two concepts match - do they refer to the same
&gt;thing (or can I infer that they refer to the same thing).

That unfortunately begs the question, when what we are discussing is 
what things there are for the concept to refer to. Most ontological 
thinkers would say that when  they are using continuant language, 
they are referring to continuants, which wouldnt help you fit 
continuants into the 4-d ontological framework.

&gt;So for example, in
&gt;the case of continuants and life histories, I can conclude either that a
&gt;continuant is the same as a life-history, or at least that they are
&gt;equivalent, i.e. for any life-history I have a continuant, and vice-versa
&gt;(there may be some additional objects involved on both sides).

They may be in 1:1 correspondence without being identical: for 
example, they might have different properties. But in any case they 
arent 1:1, since there are many histories which do not have a 
corresponding continuant.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This kind of disagreement is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not a disagreement like that between C, who wants to classify
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; airplanes with ships, and D, who wants to classify airplanes with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; birds. The IIDEAS architecture is a good way to approach a common
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ground between C and D, but there really is no common
&gt; &gt; ground between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A and B. Its not a matter of how they classify things; they don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'see' airplanes in the same ontological way. They have
&gt; &gt; fundamentally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different ways of thinking about the process of carving
&gt; &gt; up the world,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather than different categorizations of the things that you get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after doing the carving.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: I am just at the end of changing my preferred way of
&gt; &gt; seeing the world,
&gt; &gt; &gt;so I think I understand the problem here. Interestingly, it
&gt; &gt; doesn't bother
&gt; &gt; &gt;me too much. Let me explain.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: Until recently I used as my baseline a viewpoint that
&gt; &gt; said that there
&gt; &gt; &gt;were individual things like you, my car, classes, and
&gt; &gt; associations, where an
&gt; &gt; &gt;association is a relationship that understands that it lasts
&gt; &gt; for a period of
&gt; &gt; &gt;time. I have moved to a 4D approach, replacing individual things with
&gt; &gt; &gt;spatio-temporal extents, and associations with timeless
&gt; &gt; relations. However,
&gt; &gt; &gt;I know very well how to take something from my old model and
&gt; &gt; represent it in
&gt; &gt; &gt;the new model, and vice-versa.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wonder if you really can do this, if you think hard about it. I've
&gt; &gt; been living within a 4-d ontology for a long time and mapping other
&gt; &gt; ontologies to it, and what I find is that many distinctions simply
&gt; &gt; vanish, rather than being 'translated'. This is fine with me, of
&gt; &gt; course, but it tends to get the other folk a little upset, especially
&gt; &gt; when they have written entire books about these distinctions. And in
&gt; &gt; the other direction, I find that perfectly reasonable-seeming things
&gt; &gt; in my ontology, like 'moving' (sloping in space/time) boundaries,
&gt; &gt; simply cannot be admitted into the other ontologies without producing
&gt; &gt; unacceptable confusions.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Let me take this in two parts. I agree that many distinctions from other
&gt;world viewpoints disappear in a 4-D ontology. On the other hand I find that
&gt;you can recover the concepts of other ontologies from a 4-D ontology, though
&gt;you need to provide the definition of how to do this for your "other"
&gt;ontology so that you can do the mapping.
&gt;
&gt;MW: On the other hand, as you find, I do not find the reverse is true. There
&gt;are things that can be expressed in a 4-D ontology, that cannot, as you say,
&gt;be translated into other ontologies. This simply means that a 4-D ontology
&gt;is more capable than the others. This just makes it sensible to choose a 4-D
&gt;ontology to be your underlying ontology which you use as a hub to translate
&gt;others to and from.

I largely agree, but unlike you I don't think the 4-d way of thinking 
is universal. It is of wider utility, but it has its limitations like 
any other framework. It isnt even adequate for quantum theory, in 
fact, without some rather convoluted hacking.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The limitation is that there are some things
&gt; &gt; &gt;that I can now represent that I could not before. This is to
&gt; &gt; be expected,
&gt; &gt; &gt;and is due to the limitations in the previous model.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And are you SURE there is nothing that you could represent before
&gt; &gt; that you can no longer represent?
&gt;
&gt;MW: In practice yes, strictly no. In the previous ontology there were some
&gt;things you could say that did not make sense (we didn't bother to eliminate
&gt;them with axioms) but there isn't anything valid that we can't represent
&gt;(though of course it will be represented differently).

How about the observation that you and I are the same people we were 
yesterday? How do you talk about things that might have happened 
yesterday but didn't, or about the two different things that might 
happen tomorrow (as in doing planning)?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: How to make these transformations is precisely what the IIDEAS
&gt; &gt; &gt;architecture is for.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (BTW, I think that what seems to me to be overoptimism about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prospects of the SUO among some folk might arise from
&gt; &gt; their failure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to appreciate that such incompatible conceptualizations can even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, let alone all have their uses.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: I have a simple attitude towards incompatible
&gt; &gt; conceptualisations: they
&gt; &gt; &gt;mean we do not understand the world around us. The world
&gt; &gt; around us is not
&gt; &gt; &gt;incompatible with itself,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh come, come, this is impossibly naive for someone of this century.
&gt; &gt; As a matter of fact, in the best story about the world that the human
&gt; &gt; race has so far managed to produce, viz. quantum electrodynamics, the
&gt; &gt; world around us IS incompatible with itself, in that we have to use
&gt; &gt; two incompatible ways of conceptualizing it in order to fully
&gt; &gt; describe it.
&gt;
&gt;MW: My point is though that these are just theories, not the world itself. I
&gt;will claim that these theories are inadequate for some circumstances, and
&gt;physicists will agree with me.

This is Einstein's robust view of the integrity of the 'Old One', but 
he was ably refuted by Bohr. In fact, God *does* play with dice. If 
anything 'really' exists, it is a spatial density of the square root 
of a probability. This is even worse than its sounds, when one asks 
the question, the probability of what?, since the answer to *that* 
question apparently depends on the experimental apparatus.

&gt; &gt; There is no single underlying theory of the world, and
&gt; &gt; some of the best minds who have thought about the matter during the
&gt; &gt; last century have concluded that there is no way to produce one.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Allow me to bring you up to date. During the last 30 years or so
&gt;something called string theory has been developed which does things like
&gt;bring relativity and quantum theory together, explain why light can behave
&gt;like a wave and a particle, and help to explain the very early universe. I
&gt;recommend the popular science book "The Elegant Universe" by Brian Greene,
&gt;one of the developers of the theory.

I've read it. I also have polled the opinions of a number of working 
theoretical physicists, and their uniform opinion is that while 
string (actually superstring) theory is fascinating and a tour de 
force, etc., it in fact is not(yet) an acceptable universal physical 
theory, for a number of reasons. The chief ones are that it makes no 
new predictions, it cannot possibly be tested against experiment, and 
that it involves the introduction of a large number of unfounded 
theoretical assumptions which are, to put it mildly, rather hard to 
swallow, such as that the universe is n-dimensional for some largish 
n (about 20 at the present time, I believe).  The chief theoretical 
worry about it, I think, is that it's not clear whether or not the 
way that superstring theory accounts for the fundamental constants 
(its chief claim to fame) is actually predictive, or just a 
consequence of the underlying topological richness of the 
mathematical constructs.  Maybe with 20-odd dimensions to play with, 
one could have found harmonics which would fit *any* empirical data. 
This is still, I believe, an open mathematical issue. Oh, and by the 
way, superstring theory still doesn't reconcile quantum entaglement 
with common sense.

But in any case, if you want to propose basing the SUO on superstring 
theory, I think you have a lonely road to follow.  Meanwhile, the 
quantum oddities encroach ever further into the macrosopic world: the 
existence of superposed quantum states has now been demonstrated at 
the molecular scale (where it has direct technological consequences, 
eg giving rise to 'ghost images' in scanning microscopy), and the 
existence of 'entangled' particle pairs (which violate causality 
according to Bell's theorem) has been demonstrated at kilometer 
distances.

&gt;MW: So I will argue that you are the one who is naive if you think that the
&gt;universe could exist if it was not self consistent, even if we do not
&gt;understand it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If
&gt; &gt; anything, the world gets more and more mysterious rather than more
&gt; &gt; and more coherent; and if there is a single coherent account, it
&gt; &gt; certainly will not bear the remotest similarity to any 'common-sense'
&gt; &gt; ontology of things, events and so on.  The basic material of the
&gt; &gt; universe in QED seems to be a field which when multiplied by itself
&gt; &gt; becomes a kind of spatially located probability. If you know what the
&gt; &gt; square root of an information density is, then maybe you can produce
&gt; &gt; an acceptable world-ontology; but the very basic SUO distinctions -
&gt; &gt; between material and immaterial, for example - were rendered obsolete
&gt; &gt; by physics over a century ago. A pure vacuum has an intrinsic energy
&gt; &gt; and hence a nontrivial mass, for example. Things with mass have no
&gt; &gt; well-defined position in space, and so on.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Again I am not that concerned. In engineering, we are happy to rely on
&gt;Newtonian physics, even for getting to the moon, so whilst deeper ontologies
&gt;are useful for the way they can unify apparently correct but conflicting
&gt;ontologies, I expect that we will continue to use our common sense
&gt;ontologies on a day to day basis.

Oh, I agree entirely. My point was in response to your claim that 
since there is only one world out there, that therefore there can be 
a single best ontology. If you are going to retreat to 'common sense' 
(the existence of which I am beginning to doubt), then I will just 
repeat my insistence that there are mutually incoherent but equally 
valid ways of conceptualising the common-sense world.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;so if there are two theories about the world that
&gt; &gt; &gt;are incompatible, I expect there to be an underlying theory
&gt; &gt; that can explain
&gt; &gt; &gt;why both of the incompatible theories work within the range
&gt; &gt; that they are
&gt; &gt; &gt;found to be useful. The problem is that this underlying
&gt; &gt; theory may not yet
&gt; &gt; &gt;have been discovered. We can then identify an area for research.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But this 'area' seems to encompass all of science, from particle
&gt; &gt; physics to cosmology and everything in between.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Yes, and interestingly this is just what String Theory covers.

I think you have been led astray by the Brian Greene's enthusiasm.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you use an IIDEAS style of resolution , you will have a global
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ontology that allows all ways of carving the world. But you can't
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just lump them all together, since A's way literally doesnt make
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense in B's vocabulary, and vice versa; so you will have some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very-high-level distinctions which are basically a kind of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; philosopher's catalog of different approaches to styles
&gt; &gt; of conceptual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individuation, with separate (and incommensurate)
&gt; &gt; ontologies attached
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; below each tip node.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: I suppose you could do that, but it isn't what I have in
&gt; &gt; mind (see
&gt; &gt; &gt;above).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes. I think that you believe that there is a single, universally
&gt; &gt; acceptable, ontology, and that all others can be mapped into it. I
&gt; &gt; think this will happen only when science stops, and as I dont think
&gt; &gt; that will ever happen, I dont share your optimism about the Universal
&gt; &gt; Ontology (not Upper, notice!)
&gt;
&gt;MW: I think our position is much the same as science. There are a number of
&gt;ontologies (theories) some of which can be explained by others. There
&gt;probably isn't yet an ontology that explains everything, though I believe
&gt;the search for one is worthwhile (just as long as you don't expect to
&gt;discover it tomorrow). I also believe that much of our current ontologies
&gt;will remain useful. One of the main things we will gain from a (more)
&gt;universal ontology is an understanding of the limits to the ones we use
&gt;currently, rather than that we would stop using them.

Bertrand Russel somewhere has the following demonstration that naive 
realism (the doctrine that things are pretty much what they seem to 
be) is false:

  Naive Realism leads to Science.
Science shows Naive Realism to be false.
Therefore Naive Realism, if true, is false.
Therefore it is false.

Apply this reasoning to 'common sense' and you have my refutation of 
your optimism. You can't have it both ways: either we are doing real 
physics or we are doing naive physics: but we can't be doing both, 
since real physics isn't naive. Either we are trying to describe the 
actual world, in which case we can, I guess, reasonably expect that 
one day the human race should manage to achieve a single Grand 
Unified Theory, since there seems to be just one world to be 
described (but the last century ought to have shaken our old 
confidence; and we certainly don't have it yet; and we can be sure it 
will be nothing whatever like our common-sense view of the 
middle-sized world) or, we can be trying to capture our intuitive 
knowledge of everyday things, in terms that adapt naturally to our 
intuitive mental concepts; but then the fact of there being one world 
provides no confidence that one person's natural framework is 
identical to another person's.
