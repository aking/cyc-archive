&gt; Jim, 
&gt; 	.	This has turned into a suggested set of alterations to the
&gt; SUO group methods of working. I believe these are pragmatic ways of
&gt; overcoming the recent hiatus that has obstructed our progress. You may like
&gt; to consider the approaches suggested below as ways of improving the SUO
&gt; development process. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew et al, 
&gt; 	.		I will provide a brief note, in numerical order, on
&gt; each of the 3 e-mails below: 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	RE: #3 "Flawed Approach: So long as Ian Niles is
&gt; co-ordinating (and actually doing) the work, I suggest the structure of the
&gt; basis is, de facto, under his control, taking into account the input from
&gt; the rest of us. If we get to a stage where someone actually suggests a
&gt; different structure (absolute silence so far .......), and Ian rejects it on
&gt; a basis the majority of us disagree with, then this issue could be worth
&gt; revisiting. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	At present, Ian is showing worthwhile effort , and is
&gt; genuinely adapting participants comments in a reasonable way, including
&gt; taking note when there is reaction to solution paths he has developed in the
&gt; absence of guidance or when he has attempted to rationalise things himself. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	An important aspect that Ian should continue to do, is
&gt; advising the group of every change that he makes on his own initiative, so
&gt; that their merits can be considered in the light of the breadth of
&gt; experience of the other group members. 
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	I propose that Ian Niles be accepted as the co-ordinator and
&gt; developer of the SUO content, on the basis that no-one else is proposing or
&gt; offering to undertake the work. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I further propose that the SUO content co-ordinator and
&gt; developer be required to advise the group of every change that s/he makes on
&gt; their own initiative, so that the merits of each such change can be
&gt; considered by the other group members. 

The position you describe for Ian is called a "Technical Editor" in IEEE parlance.  It is roughly equivalent to the ISO/IEC position called "Project Editor".  An IEEE Technical Editor is the "keeper of the pen", i.e., he/she is a subject area expert who takes direction from the committee and merges changes into the document.

&gt; 	.	RE: #5 'Email Process': I agree about the resourcing problem
&gt; with the more usual standards development approach you mention. Another
&gt; issue is that it is necessarily far slower than other approaches are capable
&gt; of being - that's one of the reasons the Internet is being taken up as a
&gt; mean of facilitating and expediting work. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	In regard to your final comment that: "We could make the
&gt; e-mail stuff work better than it does", I wish to suggest an oft used and
&gt; well proven approach, including in standards development. This is that each
&gt; comment include a "proposed solution". This works best when the proposed
&gt; solution provides actual suggested alternative content that can be readily
&gt; assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem. 

Agree!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I suggest that, if this approach is undertaken, then we will
&gt; make far better and faster progress.  
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	I propose that all future comments on the SUO development
&gt; each include a "proposed solution". As far as possible, the proposed
&gt; solution is to provide actual suggested alternative content that can be
&gt; readily assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem.
&gt; Comments that do not do this will not be ignored, but their adoption cannot
&gt; be achieved until a satisfactory proposed solution has been identified and
&gt; accepted. 

Very nice suggestions Graham.
