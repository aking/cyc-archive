&gt;Pat, may I yet again suggest we can avoid a lot of problems if we are clear
&gt;and consistent about whether we use any particular term to refer to the
&gt;real world or to a representation.

By all means, but I wonder if you and I agree on quite what these 
terms mean. I havn't been talking about representations at all; 
relations are things in the semantics. (I do sometimes slip and 
forget to say 'symbol' in 'relation symbol', mea culpa.)

&gt;In particular I use the word relation only to refer to a representation of
&gt;the real world, and in conformity with Ted Codd's definition.

I'm not familiar with Ted Codd's work, but this isnt the sense in 
which the term is used throughout mathematics and philosophy, and I'm 
afraid that I would find it impossible to adapt to this usage.

&gt;As such, I
&gt;see no problem in it only being a table of surrogates.  Conversely I use
&gt;the word relationship only to refer to the thing in the real world made up
&gt;of arbitrary entites.

I am not sure quite what y'all consider to be "in the real world" 
here. There is a very good sense in which the actual world consists 
of nothing but stuff arranged in space and time, for example. Sorry 
if I seem to be very academic and persnickety, but I tend to agree 
with John Sowa that talk about what is 'real' is rather dangerous in 
these contexts. I really do not know whether sets are 'real' in the 
sense that, say, my desk is. They certainly arent *physically* real. 
But I don't really care, either; my point about 'surrogates' is just 
that sets can be sets of anything. The real things are the things in 
the sets, not the sets themselves.

&gt;In my experience, every relationship in the real world of whatever
&gt;arbitrary entities can be adequately represented using one or more
&gt;relations with suitable surrogates in its columns.

Well now, that is obviously wrong. There are certainly relations that 
cannot be represented using tables of surrogates: for example, the 
property of being an uncomputable number, or indeed *any* interesting 
arithmetic relation (such as addition). But more concretely, consider 
the fact that there are galaxies we can see but we cannot see any of 
the stars in them, and consider the relation (in the real, real 
world) of being a star in a galaxy. You can't adequately represent 
that one with a table of surrogates since we havnt got any surrogates 
for all those invisible stars.

&gt;Does this help?

Er...I didnt feel like I needed any help on this particular topic. A 
relation is a set of tuples. Relations have been sets of tuples since 
I was an undergraduate math major, and they will go on being sets of 
tuples. Its hard to think of anything clearer than that.

&gt;Incidently, while I agree that the word relation is well defined in
&gt;symbolic logic and relational databases, I am not aware of the same being
&gt;true of the word relationship.

No, it isn't, you are right. I will avoid using it for just that 
reason, in fact.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Graham and Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To avoid endless problems caused by mismatched definitions,
&gt; &gt;I suggest that we adopt the following equivalences between
&gt; &gt;terms:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. The terms "relation" and "relationship" in ordinary
&gt; &gt;    English have multiple meanings.  But the use in both
&gt; &gt;    symbolic logic and in relational databases is firmly
&gt; &gt;    established.  I recommend that we restrict all uses
&gt; &gt;    of those two words to the meanings in logic and RDBMS.
&gt;
&gt;I'm happy with that. That was my point about relations being
&gt;identical to their extensions (as far as logic is concerned.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. In RDB, a relation is defined by a table.  The number
&gt; &gt;    of columns in the table is critical:  a binary or dyadic
&gt; &gt;    relation has two columns, a ternary or triadic relation
&gt; &gt;    has three columns, etc.  Each row of the table is
&gt; &gt;    called a tuple or a relationship.
&gt;
&gt;In (old) KIF, one could also have mixed-arity 'tables', so I wouldnt
&gt;say that the number was *critical* exactly. But I'm just quibbling.
&gt;More seriously (and this gets back to the old disagreement between us
&gt;which arose again recently). I'm a bit unhappy about identifying a
&gt;relation with a 'table', since "table" suggests something that could
&gt;be stored in a computer, ie a datastructure of some kind. But as long
&gt;as we allow 'tables' that can be made up af arbitrary entities (and
&gt;not just 'surrogates') then I agree, this is a useful metaphor for
&gt;thinking about extensional relations.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;......
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The words "property" and "attribute" have been used in many
&gt; &gt;confusing ways.  I suggest that we use them only as synonyms
&gt; &gt;for monadic (or unary) predicate.
&gt;
&gt;I agree. This is the only sense of them that I intend to use.
&gt;
&gt;Pat
