Mike, 
	.	If we review and adapt the strengths of all the existing
ontologies, and build from there, we should have something better than all
of them. That is, unless 
*	someone has already done that; and/or 
*	someone really has a good one already. 

	.	In either case, the task is already done, isn't it? 

	.	This is just the standard engineering approach for design
development. Come ride on an XPT sometime, and you can experience some of
that sort of work I did. They might not actually fly, but they've been
running for 20 years, and just had a life extension for a further 10 years
while Australia decides whether to replace them with TGVs.

Thanks, Bob, for taking the time to express those views.  You make some
very good points, that people should consider very seriously. In particular,
there is no point in producing something that is similar to but only
somewhat
better than Cyc. I agree that a solid foundation is needed - but that it
will
be very difficult to achieve and probably needs funding of some sort.

I vote NO.

Before commenting on the proposed ontology, I think it worth while to
point out that, in my view, this vote is unnecessary and divisive.  I
think it is poor judgment on the part of the chair to call for votes on
his own initiative and without discussion of the wisdom and timing of
such a vote.  It puts people in the difficult position of wanting to be
supportive of work being done but having to say the work is not a
satisfactory basis for a long term effort.

This situation could have been avoided by first determining that a vote
was desired by the participants and before calling for a vote,  clearly
stating how the vote will be counted.  I mean basic things like how many
people are eligible to vote (at this particular time), who the eligible
voters are (name), how the votes will be counted (e.g. does ABSTAIN
count as NO), is a super majority (60%, 75%, etc.) required and how will
a percent YES (or  NO) be determined - as a percent of those voting or
as a percent of those eligible to vote - is a quorum required, if so how
large a quorum.

Standards organizations have carefully defined rules about voting.  The
rules vary among organizations and situations, but whatever they may be
they are clearly stated.  In many cases the rule is 75% of those
eligible to vote and 75% of those actually voting must vote YES (ABSTAIN
does not count as YES).  This may or may not be appropriate for this
group, but some clearly stated procedure is required.

Since there have been several statements that the IEEE is silent about
voting procedures in this type of group, as a separate matter I will
propose a set of voting rules for the group's consideration, comments,
revision, etc. If the group can come to a general agreement on a
particular procedure, then I will move that they be formally
adopted.

I agree with the technical criticisms offered by Pat Hayes, John Sowa,
Nicola Guarino and others about the specifics of this particular
ontology.  I also believe the technique of alignment / merger will not
produce an ontology that will be widely accepted.  This is in large
measure the approach taken by Cyc and they have done it reasonably
well.   A similar approach, if done well, is likely to produce an
ontology that is different , but about as useful as Cyc.  If it is done
well it will be costly and it  seems to me this would be a waste of
considerable resource.

I am not arguing that Cyc be accepted as "the" standard upper level
ontology - Cyc already is the "standard" to the extent there is one.
Doug Lenat (Cyc's CEO) offered his co-operation in one of the first
messages posted to this list (I couldn't find this message in the
archives).  The Cyc upper level is not what I would prefer as an upper
level ontology.  It is what I recommend to clients that need one -- for
commercial purposes, it really is the only game in town.  It also has
the considerable advantage of working with Cyc's lower level ontologies.

Doug is willing to convert to a "Standard" if a reasonable one is
developed.  I will quote a paragraph from a note I submitted to the list
in May that I am also unable to find in the archives.

     In previous discussions with Doug, he has been willing to
     adopt a standard reference ontology should one emerge.  The
     caveats are (1) that it is well constructed (2) that it
     enables Cyc to do things that it currently cannot or cannot
     without great difficulty (3) that the expense of adopting a
     new upper level be reasonable (4) and that the discernible
     advantages to Cyc from (1),(2) &amp; (3) above are not marginal.
     (-- Doug, I hope this is an accurate representation of your
     views.)   I believe this is reasonable and also sets a default
     as to what is worth doing.  Another upper level ontology about
     as good as Cyc or somewhat better would not be
     worth the scale of investment that I think will be required.

The approach that I believe will produce a satisfactory result is along
the lines of Nicola's suggestion that a small group of highly competent
people meet to hammer out a basic philosophical / logical approach as a
foundation for a computational artifact (an upper level ontology)  that
will be broadly useful and widely accepted.  After (and only after) such
an agreement can be reached,  the concepts that have already been
examined, described, defined/partially defined, axiomized, etc. can be
properly placed in the new ontology.

This is not a merger of existing ontologies.  It is the creation of a
new ontology -- and where appropriate,  using some of the content of
existing ontologies in a principled way.  If the concept(s) and its
relation(s) have been considered for use in one ontology, the
intellectual capital this represents is a huge advantage over starting
from scratch, even if the concept is used differently or not at all.

A criticism of this method is that after 2500 years of disputation, it
may seem overly optimistic to expect agreement on basic philosophical /
logical issues - currently there are strong disagreements among well
known, vividly articulate personalities.  My response is to avoid
attempting a resolution of basic philosophical issues by asking for
agreement where possible; when agreement is not possible, compromise on
the implementation of these issues in a way that doesn't do violence to
deeply held beliefs.  One is asking for agreement on the design of a
computational artifact - not realism vs nominalism, etc.  Newtonian vs
relativistic physics might be useful as an analogy.  Although one may
know that the universe operates differently in fundamental ways,
Newtonian physics solves the vast majority of problems encountered in
anything like ordinary experience (including space travel  - at least
the travel done to date).

A first attempt at this approach was made at the Heidelburg Conference.
This was a private, invitation only conference held at the European
Media Lab located at the Villa Bosch in Heidelburg with generous support
from the Klaus Tschira Foundation - a private German foundation that
also supports the European Media Lab.  The theory group was composed of
people who are competent and well known in the field.  Among them are
some who have contributed to this list.  The participants were chosen
both for their competence and because they are well known to have
strongly held and differing views.  The idea being that agreement among
them would have a chance of broad acceptance.

It is an understatement to say that ideas were challenged -- so was
intellectual ability and parentage (among other things), people stormed
in and out of meetings, furniture was broken...  After about ten
straight days (of 10 to 12 hour days) an agreement was reached
concerning many of the high level (and most difficult) issues.  Much of
what was agreed upon were what factors should be used (or not used) in a
factored combinatorial structure that results in a lattice.  This
structure is somewhat similar to Formal Concept Analysis that was
mentioned by someone in an earlier note to this list - however the
discussion did not center on category theory vs set theory, etc.

This work needs to be fleshed out and it takes a serious effort that
cannot be done on a volunteer basis.  I am hopeful that funds will be
available soon for this purpose.  If so, it will be only a beginning.

Creating a standard upper level ontology - a reference ontology - will
be costly,  connecting it up to natural language (common English for
starters) will be very costly.   It is naive to think otherwise.  It is
also naive to think that the proposed merged ontology can serve as a
basis for a standard.  However, it is important intellectual capital
that should be encouraged and preserved.

Bob
