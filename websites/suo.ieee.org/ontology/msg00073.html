All, 
	.	These two contributions raise an important issue. What do we
expect to achieve? Do we expect to make significant leaps in quality
compared to previous attempts? If so, on what grounds (eg. do we have access
to some unprecedented insight)? 

	.	 If there is nothing fundamentally wrong with CYC, or some
other upper level ontology, for that matter, shouldn't we be concentrating
on refining the best one, so long as it has the availability criteria we
need? I would also allow candidacy from a lower level ontology, from which
we could extract the high level subset, if that is likely to provide a
superior solution. Of course, substituting high quality substructures would
also possibly improve the end result. 

	.	My own impression at present is that we will have to face up
to the issue of dimensional analysis, and choose base dimensions that
maximise utility. This is a matter I queried very early in the piece, and
didn't get any tangible answers. It also underpins what so much of the
discussion to date has been hedging around, including the controversy about
language options. Yet, the various ontologies available have almost
certainly already made (necessarily hard, if good frameworks are to be
produced) decisions in this area. 

	.	Has anyone reviewed the ontologies from this perspective,
and is able to summarise the dimensions that underpin them? 

	.	A comparative assessment of them, and each's consequent
utilities and disutilities would be beneficial around now.

Subject:	SUO: Reference Ontology



Pat,
I saw your note on the SUO list regarding alternate ontologies.  You are
obviously correct about the impossibility of getting everyone to agree
on a "single coherent upper level ontology". I do think it is possible
to create a single upper level ontology - a standard Reference Ontology
(RO) - that a vast majority of users would find acceptable.  To be
successful,  the RO should be implemented as a software artifact on a
widely known (university, research institute, etc.) server, declared to
be fully in the public domain and completely free.

Even though alternative ontologies can be "equally valid and coherent,
even though they differ from one another" the Reference Ontology would
widely accepted if it is well constructed, serves most user purposes and
is free.  If the RO is not widely adopted it should be considered a
failure regardless of  its intellectual merit.

Correspondingly, if the alternative "standard" ontologies are not widely
adopted they should also be considered failures (both individually and
in the aggregate) regardless of their intellectual merit.  I don't wish
to demean intellectual merit.  An ontology might have considerable
intellectual merit and be of great value to a small group of users -
especially if they are researchers - but not be of value to a wide
audience.  The failure is their inability to become a "standard" in the
sense of reaching  a large enough and diverse enough audience.  The
imprimatur of any standards organization (IEEE, ANSI or ISO, etc.) will
not matter if there is not wide acceptance.

I don't believe the SUO group is likely to create a standard upper level
ontology if "widely adopted" is part of the meaning of standard. The
notes posted indicate that participants have many and differing agendas
- intellectual, commercial, and  personal.  However, it is possible that
the group will create something that gains the imprimatur of a standards
group.

In a (much) earlier note to the SUO list I suggested that CYC should be
considered the default SUO.  They have a working ontology that is the
best known and most widely used.  Of course, everyone would have
constructed CYC differently - and, I suspect, different from each
other.  Reasonable people may disagree with many aspects of CYC but I
don't think one can reasonably argue that it is not well thought out and
created on a scale much larger than other general purpose ontologies.

If one cannot create a general purpose upper level ontology that is
significantly better than CYC then the effort should stop.  An ontology
that is about as good or somewhat better than CYC is not worth the cost
(which will be large).  I believe such an ontology can be created, but
not easily and not by volunteer labor.

Some of the subscribers to this list will know that I have pursued the
goal of a Reference Ontology for a number of years. The difficulty has
been that the cost is large and the result (to be widely adopted) must
be entirely free. I am still optimistic about both the ability to create
a Reference Ontology that will be widely accepted and to fund such an
effort.

Bob

Subject:	RE: SUO: RE: More KIF-ified Ontology Content

Pat-
My understanding of the purpose (or one purpose) of the SUO effort was to
create a defining vocabulary of basic terms that will allow a user to define
a concept in terms of the SUO and thereby permit someone with a different
ontology to use the same concept, with the same axioms and inferences, when
two ontologies want to transfer information.   What this requires is a set
of basic concepts that will allow differing perspectives on the same issue
to be represented, and allow differing perspectives to be recognized as
such.
Your point, as I understand it, has been asserted previously:
&gt; My point was that there isn't going to be (for the 
&gt; reasons which Chris outlined so cogently in his original message) one 
&gt; Good Enough Ontology, if 'good enough' means that it will accommodate 
&gt; all ontological perspectives reasonably well. You seem to think that 
&gt; this is like choosing a standard notation, but it's more like taking 
&gt; a definite position on every deep question in philosophical analysis 
&gt; for the last two thousand years, and declaring that particular 
&gt; combination of philosophical perspectives to be 'good enough' for 
&gt; everyone to use for any reasonable purpose. Why do you think that 
&gt; people have been arguing about this for so long, if they felt that 
&gt; one or another position was 'good enough'? 

The question, whether one defining vocabulary can be found to express any
chosen perspective, does not require that every perspective be accepted as
true in the basic ontology.  A standard upper ontology can be used to define
many incompatible "possible worlds", which, if properly documented, will be
recognized as incompatible.  We can define Newtonian and relativistic
mechanics using the same language-that's my hope for the SUO.
The question your comment raises is whether there are some pairs of concepts
so fundamentally different that no common set of defining axioms can serve
to define both.  If we define both time points and time intervals, and allow
the users to decide which representation of time is best for their
applications, will any logical contradictions occur within the defining
vocabulary?  More generally, it would be very important to have examples of
differing viewpoints that appear to be so fundamentally different that no
basic set of axioms can define both.  If you could provide some examples of
such incompatible concepts it would be a great help in clarifying the
fundamental issue we have to deal with.
To consider one of your specific questions:
&gt;  Do the axioms refer to things which endure through time, and 
&gt; consider these a fundamentally different kind of entity than things 
&gt; which happen at a time? Do they assume that truths are asserted at a 
&gt; time (and hence are implicitly or explicitly tensed) or are the 
&gt; assertions themselves timeless, and asserted about temporally located 
&gt; things? 
Certainly, axioms serving as assertions about specific material objects in
space-time till be time-dependent, but axioms used for defining classes of
concepts by their relation to other objects will not necessarily be
time-dependent. The axioms might look very similar in many cases, except for
an explicit time point or time interval in assertions about objects in the
real world.  Is there some logical contradiction in believing that we can
have both time-independent definitional axioms and time-dependent
assertional axioms?
&gt; When the properties of something change with time, does one 
&gt; indicate this by referring to the time at which they hold, or does 
&gt; one regard the relations and properties as holding of temporal 
&gt; 'slices' of the things, or does one refer to the changes explicitly? 

Do you think it is impossible to create one set of defining concepts that
will allow a user to assert facts using any one of these methods, as seems
best suited for the task?  
It can be anticipated that different users might well create different
ontologies in which the axioms are contradictory.   This is unavoidable with
any defining vocabulary-one user says "yes" when another says "no".  The
function of the SUO in such cases is to point out the differing definitions
used for similar objects, which will allow one system to adjust its
reasoning about objects defined in other ontologies, and in favourable cases
to recognize the different inferences that the other system must generate
using its different definitions.  With a common defining vocabulary, there
is a mechanism to allow correct inferences can be drawn (provided the two
systems exchange their definition set), and without a common vocabulary the
chances may be nil in many cases.

&gt; Some things are easier to say in some ways than others; some 
&gt; things are unsayable in some combinations of answers, but those 
&gt; combinations are recommended by weighty ontological authorities armed 
&gt; with truckloads of scholarship, so you are going to have some mighty 
&gt; battles ahead. (Guarino agrees with Aristotle that all events 
&gt; ultimately derive from enduring continuants; other living 
&gt; philosophers agree with Heraclitus that the primary mode of existence 
&gt; is flux, so things supervene on events. People will still be arguing 
&gt; about this two millenia from now. Practical folk use whichever 
&gt; viewpoint is handiest, but then they don't have to be logically 
&gt; consistent.)
The SUO goal is to find the most basic logical vocabulary in which
everything is "sayable".  You seem to have no trouble describing the
differences above in English.  My belief is that if something can be defined
in English, it can be defined in a logical language-provided that it is
meaningful, and the English is unambiguous in its intended context.

&gt; Whatever you decide, you had better get it done soon, as 
&gt; most of these files of axioms being produced will need to be entirely 
&gt; re-written, since every author writes axioms based on their own 
&gt; idiosyncratic answers to these (and other) questions, and their 
&gt; particular assumptions are built into their very way of thinking, and 
&gt; not made explicit, but are inconsistent with other author's implicit 
&gt; answers. 
Here I strongly agree.  We need to work top-down to create the defining
vocabulary for the most basic concepts, and use those to create more complex
concepts, and so on.  The temptation is to try the more interesting
middle-level concepts first, which has the risk you point out.
&gt; 
&gt; Guarino's mereology isn't compatible with Simon's, and neither of them 
&gt; are compatible with Tarski (last time I looked), so y'all had better 
&gt; decide which you want to believe. Most of the mereological accounts 
&gt; of space do not allow things like lines, surfaces or points to occur 
&gt; in the domain of discourse, and rapidly generate inconsistencies if 
&gt; they are allowed in, so you had better not meet anyone who wants to 
&gt; talk about the length or shape of a boundary line.
If others agree that the goal of an SUO is to allow anything to be defined,
then we need to accommodate lines and points and open and closed intervals
as well as regions of space.  If someone wants to define some concepts
without using lines or points, those concepts should still be very
well-formed and well-defined.  If inferences on the objects defined in that
way differ from those using points and lines, then the users need to be
aware of the differences and choose the representation that provides the
reasoning power they need.

&gt; (Check the Cyc geography axioms pretty carefully, and be prepared to 
&gt; re-think them one at a time;
Do you think there are logical inconsistencies in the CYC base KB?  (I think
there are gaps that need filling, but that's a different question).
&gt;  Holes require something like pieces of space in the ontology. . . .
One might find that different people want to define holes or some other
concepts differently.  The SUO should provide the vocabulary for any
definition, but if there is a serious difference of opinion, multiple
distinguishable definitions (with different names) can be provided, and SUO
should not require that any one definition be used.
&gt; (For example, Cyc doesn't make any firm distinction between a thing 
&gt; and the space it occupies, whereas most mereologies make a very sharp 
&gt; distinction.)
There may be cases where some choices have to be made in the SUO- certainly
distinguishing between a region of space and the matter that occupies it is
likely to be one of them.  But does CYC really fail to make any distinction?
That doesn't seem to follow from the fragment of CYC available publicly-is
it in there and I missed it, or is it something embedded in the unavailable
reasoning mechanisms?
&gt; There isn't going to be a single UO which allows them 
&gt; all to coexist, and if you try to take a bit from one and a bit from 
&gt; another you will just get incoherence and muddle.
If one views the SUO as some set of assertions about the real world we live
in, it does seem likely that there will be incompatible theories.  But if it
is considered to be the logical language that can describe the real world,
with enough well-defined content referencing objects in the real world so
that it is not merely a set of symbols, then it is not immediately obvious
that it will not be able to represent all reasonable theories about the real
world.  Mass, time (what we measure on clocks), and meter are well-defined
and provide a grounding for the other definitional symbols. Where there are
gaps, new concepts can be defined.  If some new concepts are logically
incompatible with existing content, existing content can be changed to allow
defining both old and new concepts.  We can hope that this latter necessity
will become rare as the SUO matures.

&gt; There isn't a single 
&gt; 'reasonably general and correct' ontology: there are many ontologies, 
&gt; all general and all with as valid a claim to be 'reasonable and 
&gt; correct' as all the others, but sharply incompatible with each other. 
&gt; Some ambitious folk want their ontology to include a distinct entity 
&gt; for every fact that can be asserted in the language (Jerry Hobbs 
&gt; calls these 'eventualities'), which is going to be inconsistent with 
&gt; any SUO that anyone produces.
Is it possible to define eventualities without mandating their usage?  I am
unfamiliar with this aspect of Hobbs's work.  Certainly there should be no
problem in contemplating many individual instances of the concept
"assertion"-but I presume this is a different matter.
&gt; So, in spite of your protests, you ARE 
&gt; going to have to decide on a one true ontology, or at any rate a one 
&gt; standard ontology; and if that word "standard" is going to have any 
&gt; real meaning, then it might as well be written "true", since 
&gt; obviously the point here is to say that you can have any ontological 
&gt; colour as long as it's black.
&gt; 
Not necessarily "absolutely true" but useful enough to be valuable, for all
those whose theories are definable in SUO terms, which may eventually be
almost everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; PS. [Actually an alternative strategy would be to explicitly include 
&gt; all the alternatives into the SUO, using some kind of 'context' 
&gt; mechanism, maybe (?) To be really useful however this would need to 
&gt; be more powerful than the 'micro-theory' notion used in Cyc, which is 
&gt; really only a namespace-management tool. You would want to have 
&gt; axioms relating the various notions of 'part' in different 
&gt; ontologies, or the various ways of referring to time and change, in 
&gt; the form of mappings between contexts. It would go way beyond 
&gt; SUO-KIF, for sure.]
&gt; 
The SUO itself should not contain logically incompatible axioms, but when
assertions are made about objects in the real world, contradictions can be
readily generated.  If there are incompatible Microtheories that are all
useful, they could be maintained as extensions to the SUO.
Once again, examples of concepts that simply can't both be defined with the
same set of basic concepts will be very helpful.  The examples you have
given thus far seem to mostly address the inconsistent content of differing
definitions of the same word or assertions about the real world, and it
isn't clear that in these examples you mean to assert that the different
representations can't use the same logical language.
