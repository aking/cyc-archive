Dear Mike,

&gt; While I am on a roll...  I also tend to agree with many of 
&gt; the points Pat  has made recently, which unfortunately point 
&gt; to the apparent fact that there is no compelling evidence 
&gt; that a STANDARD UO will be of value. I'm not even sure of the 
&gt; value of any UO, in most contexts.

My experience is obviously a bit different. Firstly the work we
have done in Shell and EPISTLE over the last 10 years has been
largely middle out, and we have made a major change to the top
at least once on our journey when we moved to a 4D approach.
However, if you start from the middle, you do get to some (one
or more) top. Having got there our experience is that this
can be very useful in almost every situation as at a minimum a
basis for analysis. I.e. trying to place the concepts of the
requirements at hand into the upper ontology (data model in our
case) and just asking the questions you need to do that has
been valuable both in improving the quality and the compatibility 
of the systems delivered.

Our experience is even that using a not very good upper level
model, or only using it partly is better than using none at
all.

However, that is a bit different from having a "standard" ontology
with the intention that everyone uses it. I think we might do 
better to develop one or more Reference ontologies of different
flavours with a mapping between. But I have said this before
and may propose it formally in a short while.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I could not agree more with Nicola's comment regarding the 
&gt; conduct of the SUO list. I disagree with Jim that "Our 
&gt; problem has been lack of something to focus on."  Oh 
&gt; contrairre. There are countless worthy issues to focus on. 
&gt; The lack of progress, as Nicola suggests is due to the 
&gt; general unwillingness of the group to focus on a few issues 
&gt; at a time, to make and record progress, etc. And of course, 
&gt; not to stray willy nilly into topics of little relevance. 
&gt; There was a perfect opportunity to record progress by having 
&gt; papers submitted to SUO - this was not taken up. I am not 
&gt; pointing blame anywhere, for I also failed to contribute a 
&gt; paper, due to other priorities.  I regret that the signal to 
&gt; noise ratio does not allow me to participate as I would like 
&gt; to. I regret missing out on some of the truly excellent 
&gt; discussions from which I learn a lot, most particularly due 
&gt; to Pat Hayes' prolific contributions.
&gt; 
&gt; While I am on a roll...  I also tend to agree with many of 
&gt; the points Pat  has made recently, which unfortunately point 
&gt; to the apparent fact that there is no compelling evidence 
&gt; that a STANDARD UO will be of value. I'm not even sure of the 
&gt; value of any UO, in most contexts. I heartily agree that 
&gt; starting from the top is not a good way to get a USEFUL 
&gt; ontology, as I have argued many times.  Our experience in 
&gt; applying the enterprise ontology (which from the perspective 
&gt; of our application, was a very abstract Upperish Level 
&gt; Ontology for enterprise concepts) was that there was only one 
&gt; case where it was even possible to connect to concepts in the 
&gt; EO, and there was no real benefit in doing this. There is a 
&gt; huge gaping gulf between application-specific ontologies and 
&gt; upper level ones, and it is not only difficult to bridge the 
&gt; gap, there seems to be no point in doing so.  I agree with 
&gt; Pat that one needs to start in the MIDDLE where the real 
&gt; action is, in one's given domain. Then, !
&gt; on!
&gt; !
&gt;  a demand-pull basis, add upperish-level concepts as they are 
&gt; required.  
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, I am not so confident as Pat that the 
&gt; whole effort is a waste, and doomed to fail. Having a SINGLE 
&gt; upper ontology, may well fail, but having components to 
&gt; choose from may well be useful. I still have a sense that the 
&gt; way to proceed is as follows for a given domain, at whatever level.
&gt; 1. Identify important concepts.
&gt; 2. identify different ways to model them
&gt; 3. Split the differences into two categories:
&gt; a. Those that are superficial, and are mere choices with 
&gt; minimal consequence, all may have the same models, for example.
&gt; b. Those that are IMPORTANT - such as those identified by Pat 
&gt; in his survey of time representations.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. For the non-important differences, choose one that seems 
&gt; to work,even if it is arbitrary. Anyone who does not like it, 
&gt; can choose to use their own, and map to/from it.
&gt; 5. For the important ones, develop independent and presumably 
&gt; incompatible theories which one can choose from.
&gt; 
&gt; None of this is necessarily new, having been said by various 
&gt; folk in varous ways.
&gt; 
&gt; I will stop this less than well-articulated ramble...

&gt; 
&gt; Nicola,
&gt; 
&gt; 	The message volume has not been the cause of our lack 
&gt; of progress,
&gt; it has just filled the void.  Our problem has been lack of 
&gt; something to
&gt; focus on.  Only one starter document has been proposed and 
&gt; the group did not
&gt; accept it (though it did pass in a straw poll).
&gt; 
&gt; 	Others have posted work, as you have, but have not been 
&gt; willing to
&gt; actually propose it as a group effort, probably because they 
&gt; didn't have the
&gt; time or resources to champion it any further.  This is 
&gt; understandable, but a
&gt; standard will only be developed if it has a core group 
&gt; willing to champion
&gt; it all the way.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	Unless we have this key ingredient, no measure of good 
&gt; management
&gt; will lead this group to success.

&gt; &gt;	Have you given any further thought to submitting any of 
&gt; your work as
&gt; &gt;a starter document for SUO.  As you know, the group needs one or more
&gt; &gt;documents to focus its efforts on.
&gt; 
&gt; Dear James,
&gt; 
&gt; 	The paper we have submitted to the IJCAI SUO Workshop (which 
&gt; will be presented at the IJCAI ws on ontologies) cannot be intended 
&gt; as a starter ontology, but can certainly be considered among the 
&gt; starter documents. There is no attempt to be complete, though. A 
&gt; preliminary version of our IKF reference ontology is scheduled by the 
&gt; end of this year, and we should able to announce a  preliminary 
&gt; top-level before Summer.
&gt; 
&gt; 	A further (indirect) contribution is my recent review of 
&gt; Sowa's book and especially his top-level ontology. Since the current 
&gt; merged ontology is based on it, this is implicitly a criticism to the 
&gt; merged ontology. I have no time for an open, endless discussion on 
&gt; this, but I will certainly welcome specific, focused observations.
&gt; 
&gt; 	In the meanwhile, our own contribution to the SUO initiative 
&gt; will necessarily be very limited, mainly because of the fact that 
&gt; this group hasn't been able to implement a strict issue-based 
&gt; discussion methodology, nor the "bookshelf of results" proposed in 
&gt; the past by Mike Uschold and myself. To me, the inhability of 
&gt; achieving this and the lack of control of out-of-focus discussions on 
&gt; the list reveals a serious failure of this initiative. This is also 
&gt; the reason of my abstension regarding the Chair elections.
&gt; 
&gt; 	A further reason of disappointment is the way the IEEE SUO 
&gt; workshop has been managed. Still I don't know how many papers have 
&gt; been submitted and selected. I suspect that ours was the only paper. 
&gt; This could have been a useful opportunity to force people to condense 
&gt; their proposals in papers, but apparently it didn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; 	That's it, for now. I will be more active when this list will 
&gt; be more efficient, and when a list of issues and proposals, with 
&gt; defenders and opponents for each of them, will be posted on the Web 
&gt; site. I know it is difficult, but it is the only way to proceed.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; 
&gt; -- Nicola
&gt; 
&gt; P.S.: I am answering to you only since you sent me a personal 
&gt; message; I encourage you to forward this to the whole list, however.
