&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suppose there is a sort of general,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metalinguistic schema here that exhibits
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pattern that any such relation will fit,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something like (ignoring the uniqueness clause
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for brevity):
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (forall (?X1 ... ?Xn)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (REL ?X1 ... ?Xn)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;              (exists (?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (EVENT-TYPE ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (ROLE-1 ?e ?X1)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (ROLE-n ?e ?Xn)))))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But this is pretty useless, as the event types and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corresponding roles for relations still have to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analysed out piecemeal, relation by relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There's no general principle or algorithm.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I protest:  this IS a general algorithm, if properly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stated.  The key is not to predicate 'event-type'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the ?e in question, but to connect it to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; original predication of REL, by mapping REL from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an n-ary to a unary relation REL': ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pat, you misunderstand, and please do not place
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me in the middle of all this triadicity nonsense.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was only interested, first, in helping Matthew
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get clear about the logical form of what he was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trying to assert.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, so was I.  Matthew has been quite clear, I had thought,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the ?e in his example is to be thought of as a n-tuple.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I had been reading the email deluge too quickly.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Perhaps just a tad.  What I mean is that ?e stands for the
&gt; &gt;      same real world thing as the n-tuple.  I would be reluctant
&gt; &gt;      to draw from that that the ?e was an n-tuple.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Second, I was interested in the general idea behind Matthew's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attempt -- as a piece of *ontology* -- to flesh out certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relations in terms of the occurrence of certain events.  Thus,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with regard to what I was doing -- as opposed to what 
&gt; you *thought*
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was doing -- the key is *exactly* the predication of 
&gt; "EVENT-TYPE"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the ?e in question.  The interesting question for me here was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simply when, if ever, this is a fruitful thing to do, 
&gt; ontologically.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is, when, if ever, is it fruitful to enlarge one's 
&gt; ontology to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encompass events to give a fuller ontological analysis 
&gt; of a given
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relation?  *That* is what has to be decided 
&gt; "piecemeal", that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by the careful analysis of a class of relations.  I was 
&gt; not talking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about what *can* be done logically -- I have agreed 
&gt; with you from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the beginning of your debate with the triadicians that 
&gt; the algorithm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for translating from n-ary relations to unary and 
&gt; binary relations
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is obvious and trivial -- but about whether, when, and 
&gt; how a certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class of entity might serve some useful ontological 
&gt; purpose.  Ok?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, OK.  But don't you see a rather close parallel here?
&gt; &gt; &gt; The difference between writing (EVENT-TYPE ?e) and (R' ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesnt seem to me to be worth making much fuss about,
&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly since the 'piecemeal' analysis that would
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to be done would presumably establish *some*  kind
&gt; &gt; &gt; of connection between the EVENT-TYPE in question and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; original REL.  If we utilise the syntactic freedom of revised
&gt; &gt; &gt; KIF we could write both of these in the form ((MAPPING REL) ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then just have a side theory about MAPPING, which could be
&gt; &gt; &gt; as piecemeal or as uniform as one wanted it to be able to get.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some RELs might satisfy (EVENT-PROPERTY (MAPPING REL)) where
&gt; &gt; &gt; (forall (?x ?y)(=&gt; (and (EVENT-PROPERTY ?x)(?x ?y)) 
&gt; (EVENT-TYPE ?y)))
&gt; &gt; &gt; while others might not.  But the mapping that Matthew wanted would
&gt; &gt; &gt; work smoothly either way:  the ontological status of the value of
&gt; &gt; &gt; MAPPING would be an issue which could be discussed separately.

&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, kibbitzing on this pas de trois has helped me
&gt; to see a little more of what's going on here.  I was
&gt; going to comment on the details of what I see being
&gt; thrashed out here, but I think that I will take the
&gt; novel step of following my own advice to others, and
&gt; try to take two or three steps back, and speak to the
&gt; longer run view of things.
&gt; 
&gt; You are to be complimented for your persistence here,
&gt; and also for the realistic intuition that is leading
&gt; you to recapitulate in your ontogeny many aspects
&gt; of the perspective that has been developed in the
&gt; phyllogeny of mathematics and its applications to
&gt; dynamic systems.  And if anyone is responsible for
&gt; the fact that the underlying philosophy and working
&gt; attitude of this POV is not more widely appreciated
&gt; and recognized for what it is, I guess that I will
&gt; have to blame its generations of doctrinarians and
&gt; expositors who were apparently so concerned with
&gt; the appearances of their outer dress that they
&gt; would not dare to show you their workclothes.

MW: Yes, accessibility of existing knowledge is a real problem
that often leads one to solve the problem again as being a more
efficient route to a solution than finding where it has already 
been discovered.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, I must repeat the suggestion that I have made before,
&gt; pointedly on the "Manifolds of Sensuous Impressions" thread,
&gt; that the very like of all of these issues have been tackled
&gt; before, if perhaps in a deliberately quantitative disguise.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, there are Realities and there are Representations.
&gt; Books have been written on the relation between these
&gt; two subjects, if not necessarily in that order.
&gt; 
&gt; Any Reality to which we are likely to point, appreciated
&gt; in all of its glorious splendor, is just bound to be far
&gt; more complex and vastly more subtle than the likes of us
&gt; fallible and mortal finite information beings could ever
&gt; hope to express in full, and so we arch-typically allude
&gt; to it under the aegis of "X", our Persean Shield, if you
&gt; will.  Here is where, I am beginning to suspect, a brand
&gt; of misapprehension first arises between us, for you seem
&gt; to advert to this X, arrogated as a realm in reality, or
&gt; to its typical element x, conceived as an individual, as
&gt; if this move were a simple step, even a simplifying step,
&gt; in our approximal approach to the twined reality, x in X.

MW: I have never felt the compulsion to be required to say
everything about something as a prerequisite to recognising
something's existance. I expect to have to say enough about
something so that others can distinguish the same object,
and what ever it is that I wish to communicate about it,
but not more.

MW: I also pick up from between your comments that in
logical circles "=" means precisely "stands for the same
thing". We do not have such an operatotor in data modelling,
so I have been applying a stricter test of "is the same 
thing". It is useful to know the local conventions.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, there is more to talk about here, but maybe I will
&gt; stop and check to see whether this accords with what you
&gt; see yourself to be doing, as you reflect on your customs.
&gt; 
&gt; Happy Monday!
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
