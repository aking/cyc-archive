&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;	I agree that none of the elements of your list of concepts can be
&gt;related to the taxonomic part of the current version of the merged ontology.
&gt;I agree with you, but, with the exception of 'information-bearing thing',
&gt;these gaps don't worry me.  There are three ways in which a concept can be
&gt;related to an ontology, either by being subsumed by another concept, by
&gt;having selectional restrictions for the concept stated in terms of other
&gt;concepts of the ontology (this case is relevant only for predicates and
&gt;functions), and by composing the concept out of other concepts in the
&gt;ontology by means of logical operators, set-forming operators, etc.  It
&gt;seems to me that all of your examples (again with the exception of
&gt;'information-bearing thing') could be cashed out in terms of concepts which
&gt;are directly subsumable by the ontology and logical operators.  Let's take
&gt;"the shape of Marilyn Monroe's left ankle" as an example.  We have three key
&gt;concepts here, viz. shape, Marilyn Monroe, and left ankle (note that we
&gt;might want to decompose this concept into a directional notion and a body
&gt;part, but this is a subtlety, I think).  We can put 'shape' under the
&gt;high-level concept of 'Schema', 'Marilyn Monoroe' goes under 'Person', and
&gt;'left ankle' is under something like 'BodyPart', which would be subsumed by
&gt;'Organic'.

Well yes, we could do that. We could also put everything under the 
concept "entity" and just stop there, also. If it is simply a matter 
of putting names into a tree we can always find somewhere to put 
anything, of course. But what is the *point* of doing this? I presume 
that putting these three things into these categories is supposed in 
some way to be a start on a useful analysis of their meaning, but I 
don't see any start being made here. For example, putting 'shape' 
under 'schema' tells me, as far as I can tell, virtually nothing at 
all more than putting it under 'entity'. (If it says anything at all, 
it would imply that the shape of an ankle cannot change with time, 
which is in fact false.) A syntax tree fits under under 'schema' as 
well, yet it doesn't make sense to apply that notion of shape to an 
ankle. Putting 'ankle' under 'Organic' would actually, given the 
current gloss on 'Organic', seem to be an error, unless you can tell 
me where the 'discontinuities' are.

&gt; Aside from the three key concepts in the example, there are two
&gt;implicit relations, viz. something like the embody relationship between an
&gt;object and an abstract thing and the mereological notion of 'part-of'.  As
&gt;you know, we already have the latter, and the former would be easy enough to
&gt;define, in terms of selectional restrictions, by employing the concepts of
&gt;'Object' and 'Schema'.

Ok, lets look at this. You propose to introduce a *general* 
relationship between objects and schemas ("embody"), right? But there 
is no such (useful) relation, because the concepts are not 
well-defined enough to even state a single property of it. Most 
notions of 'schema' simply don't apply to most notions of 'object'; 
the "embody" relation is extremely sparse, one might say. So sparse, 
indeed, that I think it would be more trouble than use, like the 
relation which holds between cars and their drivers, dogs and their 
hairs, and is the 'less-than' relation applied to integers. (Hey, why 
not? It's a relation, after all.) Why strive to say anything useful 
at a level of generality where nothing useful can be said?

In fact almost all of the upper-level categories seem to have this 
'dustbin' quality: they seem to include all kinds of incommensurate 
things (like shapes and syntax) which have nothing much to do with 
one another, but are grouped together largely because they have even 
less to do with anything else.

As for part-of, yes you do have the mereological notion, but I still 
don't know quite how it applies to an ankle. Since part-of apparently 
means that a part may exist without the whole, I doubt if any 
identifiable aspect of the artist's view of anatomy would count as a 
part, unless one were Sweeney Todd.

Pat

PS I'd like to know where you would put a dress style. (Is it a 
schema, or a class of schemas, or a collection of schemas, maybe?)
