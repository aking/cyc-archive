Dear Pat,

I agree with the issues you raise, but would suggest a slightly alternative
alternative solution (which is what I thought your original response to
Chris P was saying). That is that we allow the different viewpoints, but aim
to understand the relationship between them.

My experience is that if you come to the point of having to make choices,
then this was an admission that you did not understand the problem.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;[Adam:]
&gt; &gt;Pat,
&gt; &gt;  I think that you're arguing with a point that hasn't been 
&gt; &gt;asserted.  I don't think anyone would claim that the goal of the SUO 
&gt; &gt;is to create the "One True Ontology".  I would say that our goal is 
&gt; &gt;to create a "Good Enough Ontology".  There may be alternate ways to 
&gt; &gt;formalize concepts and we should make reasonable engineering choices 
&gt; &gt;to pick one decent solution and move forward.
&gt; &gt;  I'd suggest that if we come up with a product that's reasonably 
&gt; &gt;general and correct that we'll have a much better product than if 
&gt; &gt;we, on the one hand, created a host of different and incompatible 
&gt; &gt;formalizations or, on the other hand, spent eons searching for the 
&gt; &gt;one correct way to formalize every representational issue.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;[Chris Partridge:]
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;.....
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;This is a general point that I think and others have 
&gt; raised before. Unless
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;we get agreement on the high level structure (the 
&gt; ontological paradigm) and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;this will involve hard choices then I do not see how we 
&gt; can expect to
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;amalgamate the lower level theories.
&gt; 
&gt; Adam, thanks for the comment. However, I honestly cannot reconcile 
&gt; what you say with what Chris says. What is "the ontological paradigm" 
&gt; if it is not the One True Ontology? OK; never mind "True", thats a 
&gt; red herring. My point was that there isnt going to be (for the 
&gt; reasons which Chris outlined so cogently in his original message) one 
&gt; Good Enough Ontology, if 'good enough' means that it will accomodate 
&gt; all ontological perspectives reasonably well. You seem to think that 
&gt; this is like choosing a standard notation, but it's more like taking 
&gt; a definite position on every deep question in philosophical analysis 
&gt; for the last two thousand years, and declaring that particular 
&gt; combination of philosophical perspectives to be 'good enough' for 
&gt; everyone to use for any reasonable purpose. Why do you think that 
&gt; people have been arguing about this for so long, if they felt that 
&gt; one or another position was 'good enough'? You have probably hundreds 
&gt; of conceptual clashes in the KIF axiom files you already have gotten 
&gt; done.
&gt; 
&gt; The ontological differences are very basic and very real, and they 
&gt; permeate all axiom-writing. Take time for example, and never mind all 
&gt; the various temporal ontologies (interval- or point-based, dense or 
&gt; discrete or continuous, etc.), but focus on a more wide-ranging 
&gt; issue: how do the basic entities of the (wider) ontology fit into 
&gt; time? Do the axioms refer to things which endure through time, and 
&gt; consider these a fundamentally different kind of entity than things 
&gt; which happen at a time? Do they assume that truths are asserted at a 
&gt; time (and hence are implicitly or explicitly tensed) or are the 
&gt; assertions themselves timeless, and asserted about temporally located 
&gt; things? When the properties of something change with time, does one 
&gt; indicate this by referring to the time at which they hold, or does 
&gt; one regard the relations and properties as holding of temporal 
&gt; 'slices' of the things, or does one refer to the changes explicitly? 
&gt; All of these questions (and others) need to be answered, and the 
&gt; answers one gives will have consequences throughout the SUO (one 
&gt; cannot keep this genie bottled up in a temporal ontology); and there 
&gt; are no right or wrong answers. You can do it either way, in all these 
&gt; cases. Some things are easier to say in some ways than others; some 
&gt; things are unsayable in some combinations of answers, but those 
&gt; combinations are recommended by weighty ontological authorities armed 
&gt; with truckloads of scholarship, so you are going to have some mighty 
&gt; battles ahead. (Guarino agrees with Aristotle that all events 
&gt; ultimately derive from enduring continuants; other living 
&gt; philosophers agree with Heraclitus that the primary mode of existence 
&gt; is flux, so things supervene on events. People will still be arguing 
&gt; about this two millenia from now. Practical folk use whichever 
&gt; viewpoint is handiest, but then they don't have to be logically 
&gt; consistent.) Whatever you decide, you had better get it done soon, as 
&gt; most of these files of axioms being produced will need to be entirely 
&gt; re-written, since every author writes axioms based on their own 
&gt; idiosyncratic answers to these (and other) questions, and their 
&gt; particular assumptions are built into their very way of thinking, and 
&gt; not made explicit, but are inconsistent with other author's implicit 
&gt; answers. (You have Barry Smith's boundaries ontology axioms. Are 
&gt; there temporal boundaries as well as spatial? Do boundaries endure, 
&gt; or would one describe this by saying that the temporally enduring 
&gt; thing has a spatiotemporal boundary? What kind of boundary is a 
&gt; moving weather front, behind which thunderstorms can be expected this 
&gt; afternoon?)
&gt; 
&gt; Guarino's mereology isnt compatible with Simon's, and neither of them 
&gt; are compatible with Tarski (last time I looked), so y'all had better 
&gt; decide which you want to believe. Most of the mereological accounts 
&gt; of space do not allow things like lines, surfaces or points to occur 
&gt; in the domain of discourse, and rapidly generate inconsistencies if 
&gt; they are allowed in, so you had better not meet anyone who wants to 
&gt; talk about the length or shape of a boundary line. (Check the Cyc 
&gt; geography axioms pretty carefully, and be prepared to re-think them 
&gt; one at a time; and check out things like #$SheetLikeObject.) Holes 
&gt; require something like pieces of space in the ontology. Are they 
&gt; material or not? If you fill up a hole with water, is the hole full? 
&gt; (Since the only reasonable answer is 'yes and no', does this mean 
&gt; there are two notions of 'hole', or two notions of 'full'? How 
&gt; exactly do they differ?) Can one divide a hole in half? (Casati and 
&gt; Varsi say not, butif a hole is a piece of space you certainly can, eg 
&gt; consider the space occupied by the water in a flooded tunnel which is 
&gt; half-full of water.) These various differences arent the result of 
&gt; bugs or sloppiness: they reflect different ontological perspectives. 
&gt; (For example, Cyc doesnt make any firm distinction between a thing 
&gt; and the space it occupies, whereas most mereologies make a very sharp 
&gt; distinction.) There isnt going to be a single UO which allows them 
&gt; all to coexist, and if you try to take a bit from one and a bit from 
&gt; another you will just get incoherence and muddle. There isnt a single 
&gt; 'reasonably general and correct' ontology: there are many ontologies, 
&gt; all general and all with as valid a claim to be 'reasonable and 
&gt; correct' as all the others, but sharply incompatible with each other. 
&gt; Some ambitious folk want their ontology to include a distinct entity 
&gt; for every fact that can be asserted in the language (Jerry Hobbs 
&gt; calls these 'eventualities'), which is going to be inconsistent with 
&gt; any SUO that anyone produces. So, in spite of your protests, you ARE 
&gt; going to have to decide on a one true ontology, or at any rate a one 
&gt; standard ontology; and if that word "standard" is going to have any 
&gt; real meaning, then it might as well be written "true", since 
&gt; obviously the point here is to say that you can have any ontological 
&gt; color as long as it's black.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes
&gt; 
&gt; Pat
&gt; 
&gt; PS. [Actually an alternative strategy would be to explicitly include 
&gt; all the alternatives into the SUO, using some kind of 'context' 
&gt; mechanism, maybe (?) To be really useful however this would need to 
&gt; be more powerful than the 'micro-theory' notion used in Cyc, which is 
&gt; really only a namespace-management tool. You would want to have 
&gt; axioms relating the various notions of 'part' in different 
&gt; ontologies, or the various ways of referring to time and change, in 
&gt; the form of mappings between contexts. It would go way beyond 
&gt; SUO-KIF, for sure.]
