Jim, 
	.	I am restating this with amendments, as I believe the basic
structure has some merit. I believe these are pragmatic ways of overcoming
the recent hiatus that has obstructed our progress. You may like to consider
the approaches suggested below as ways of improving the SUO development
process. 

	.	I put this forward as a proposal to be considered alongside
all the alternative proposals arising at this time. At the end of this
voting process, we will have to take some path, and I suggest this one has
some merit. 


Matthew et al, 
	.		I will provide a brief note, in numerical order, on
each of the 3 e-mail topics below: 

	.	RE: #3 "Flawed Approach: So long as Ian Niles is
co-ordinating (and actually doing) the work, I suggest the structure of the
basis is, de facto, under his control, taking into account the input from
the rest of us. I am advised by Frank Farance, who is likely to know such
things, that the position is called a "Technical Editor" in IEEE parlance. 

	.	At this stage Ian's work remains the only option actually
under development. Some of the recent suggestions have been for work that
can occur in parallel, such as planning and support documentation, and
reviews of pre-existing ontologies to identify structures worth importing.
If we find some real show stoppers that don't have solutions that can be
applied, then this issue could be worth revisiting. 

	.	At present, Ian is, I believe, demonstrating worthwhile
effort, and is genuinely adapting participants comments in a reasonable way,
including taking note when there is reaction to solution paths he has
developed in the absence of guidance or when he has attempted to rationalise
things himself. 

	.	An important aspect that Ian should continue to do, is
advising the group of every change that he makes on his own initiative, so
that their merits can be considered in the light of the breadth of
experience of the other group members. In view of some comments about
difficulties re-reading the whole draft each iteration, perhaps Ian could
provide some way of flagging amendments in future drafts, so as to
facilitate others checking their merits. 

Proposed Solution: 
	.	I propose that Ian Niles be accepted as the Technical Editor
of the SUO content, on the basis that no-one else is proposing or offering
to undertake the work. 

	.	I further propose that the SUO Technical Editor be required
to: 
*	provide some form of marking indicating changes to each draft from
the previous one, so as to facilitate vetting by the other participants; and

*	advise the group of every change that s/he makes on their own
initiative, so that the merits of each such change can be considered by the
other group members. 

	.	RE: #4 'Practical Purpose': At this stage, Ian's work
remains the only option underway. For an alternative to be taken up, it
needs to be accepted as viable, and have resources available to progress it.
Any such option should be considered on its absolute and relative merits,
One aspect is that many potential alternatives may be able to be
incorporated into Ian's current work. 

	.	As mentioned above, it would be desirable for a review to be
made of pre-existing ontologies, to see whether structure and/or approaches
have merit for importation. If one is found to have very good features, it
may be that the best way is to import features of Ian's work into it, rather
than vice versa, and proceed from there. 

	.	Matthew has again raised his suggestion of EPISTLE, written
in the EXPRESS language - he originally raised it some time ago. Cyc is
another option that has been proposed in the past. Let's consider the merits
of all of them. 

Proposed Solution: 
	.	I propose that the current development work by Ian Niles be
continued until a viable alternative, with merit and resourcing arises. 

	.	I also propose that a review be made of pre-existing
ontologies, to see whether structure and/or approaches have merit for
importation. If any is found to have very good features, it may be that the
best way is to import features of Ian's work into it, rather than vice
versa, and proceed from there. 

	.	RE: #5 'Email Process': I agree about the resourcing problem
with the more usual standards development approach Matthew mentions. Another
issue is that it is necessarily far slower than other approaches are capable
of being - that's one of the reasons the Internet is being taken up as a
mean of facilitating and expediting work. 

	.	In regard to Matthew's final comment that: "We could make
the e-mail stuff work better than it does", I wish to suggest an oft used
and well proven approach, including in standards development. This is that
each comment include a "proposed solution" to, and sometimes also a
statement of the practical impacts of, the identified problem. This works
best when the proposed solution provides actual suggested alternative
content that can be readily assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the
identified problem, and the problem impacts are concretely described,
possibly including examples. 

	.	I suggest that, if this approach is undertaken, then we will
make far better and faster progress.  

Proposed Solution: 
	.	I propose that all future comments on the SUO development
each include both the following. 
*	A "problem impacts statement". This should as far as possible
provide actual impacts, possibly by way of actual examples. Comments that do
not do this will have less weight, since some theoretical impacts do not
turn out to be as significant as feared. 
*	A "proposed solution" . This should as far as possible provide
actual suggested alternative content that can be readily assessed for its
effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem. Comments that do not do
this will not be ignored, but their adoption cannot be achieved until a
satisfactory proposed solution has been identified and accepted.

Dear Jim,

I think the issue here is that what we currently have is too far from
something that would be an acceptable standard, that it does not constitute
a start point.

&gt; Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat and John 
&gt; say - is not
&gt; sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as 
&gt; Matthew says - does
&gt; not seem to be ready for practical use.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that - as it stands - the Ontology is not 
&gt; really a standard
&gt; that is fit for any practical purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of making concrete
&gt; suggestions via email is adequate for the task at hand. A point that a
&gt; number of people have made in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete 
&gt; suggestion for a way
&gt; to produce an adequate product. I think the task is of a size 
&gt; that anything
&gt; I would suggest would involve the old standards such as a project with
&gt; resources and a plan that gave some substance to the process 
&gt; of analysis to
&gt; be followed and the deliverables. But there is no point in 
&gt; starting this
&gt; unless there is some kind of commitment in terms of resources.
&gt;
