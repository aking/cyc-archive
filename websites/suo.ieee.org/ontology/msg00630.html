Subject: Re: SUO: Vote on Merged Ontology as a 'Base Document' (fwd)





I vote NO, with the following comments: 

Timing and propriety of vote:  I believe a vote of some kind is long
overdue as a reality check on whether the statement of scope and purpose
was adequately debugged prior to submission (no vote was taken to assure
that consensus had in fact been achieved, and no consideration was given
prior to the submission of whether the merger approach drew on 'best
practices'). But I do not believe it is fair or appropriate to vote on a
preliminary draft of the KIF subgroup as if it were the unique focus of
the effort.  The whole point of such a subgroup, I thought, was to test
out whether a quick overlap-and-winnow approach (my term) to merger is
possible with the simplifying limitation of being restricted to KIF and
drawing on disparate public domain upper level materials. This is only one
approach to the problem, and pushing it forward can be encouraged as a way
of stimulating longer term work without elevating it to premature voting. 
I take it that some other timetable is pushing us forward on voting by
February 1, 2001.

View of the draft:  This strikes me as a conscientious and intelligent
employment of an overlap-and-winnow method to develop central concepts
using public domain materials.  There is no exact science in this, but
good judgment disciplined by clarity about final applications go a long
way.  On the basis of work experience quite independent of this effort,
Ian Niles would be a very strong choice to make a useful contribution in
this field if there were a clearer, shared sense of the domain and
purposes to be served initially by the completed artifact.

Best Practices: I am, however, disappointed that this early draft does not
appear to make use of or reference to previous public domain practices in
the field: the Cyc-Penman upper level alignment, the upper level
EuroWordNet formed from common terms appearing in several European
language versions of WordNet, perhaps the Cyc-Wordnet alignment reported
to this list by a Bulgarian source (which I, too, have not yet checked
out), and the several attempts to generate upper level ontologies that
might be used to search a variety of legacy databases within a specific
domain. I get no sense of how this KIF effort is situated in an
increasingly competitive field, or indeed, that it is yet adequately
grounded within the field.

Methodology/Reference Object:  I brought this distinction forward several
times before to no avail, and others have put it in other ways without
much traction, but let me try one last time: a crucial conceptual
watershed in this area (and one that was the agreed 'best practice' and
building block of the previous ad hoc ontology effort)  is to distinguish
the underlying methods, architecture, specifications and algorithms of the
structure of what would be an acceptable upper level from a given
instantiation determined by specific design and semantic choices.  This
latter artifact is properly seen as a 'reference object' embodying one
version of an underlying body of standards.  Several people on this list
have further expanded on this point by pointing to the possibility of
growing and self-maintaining ontological structures permitting a variety
of users and uses.  These draw on methods that go well beyond the
merge-and-winnow approach, and cannot be adeuqately covered merely by
making explicit the 'syntactic' choices and axioms of the reference
object.

Maintenance: Are there in fact as many as five members of this group, not
under a short-term contract to participate, prepared to give Ian's content
choices continuing attention and review *and* to maintain the content
choices for 4-5 years, answering queries and making emendations?  If so,
let them continue this in the KIF subgroup and develop a reference object
so carefully hedged and specified as to be ready for a prime time vote.

Funding: I am agreeable to providing timely, positive indications
serviceable to those seeking government funding or renewals or extensions
in connection with this effort, so long as these do not involve the full
dress voting-cum-consensus apparatus of an international standards group. 

Email Mechanics: Doug Skuce, the Canadian scholar who has developed
software tools to facilitate collaboration on concept definitions,
unfortunately unsubscribed from the group fairly early. If work on the KIF
artifact goes forward, someone might wish to contact him for suggestions
on how to guard an email editing process of several hundred core concepts
from becoming a bottomless pit.

Specific aims of the editing of the KIF artifact:  the correspondence to
date suggests that the main aim of future collaborative work will be to
purge the merged artifact of concepts of merely philosophical interest.  I
question the feasibility of this, if one begins with the Sowa ontology,
whose defining virtue is as a philosophically oriented construction formed
by applying a Peircean tripartite division to Whiteheadean categories.


Summary and prognosis: It now appears that there was not a sufficient
backlog of prior work brought into the effort to provide a realistic
prospect of a successful 'quick and dirty' approach, even in the limited
KIF subgroup.  Doing the job right under a voluntaristic model, as the ISO
data integration experience first cited by Matthew West in July suggests,
will require a considerable, multi-year commitment with frequent meetings
and working papers. Whether even this is sufficient for the SUO task is
questionable: on the basis of the previous four-year experience on upper
level ontologies, and indeed the de facto structure of this current
effort, I would respectfully suggest that a productive effort will
require, above and beyond the time of standing experts retained by
participating companies, specifically authorized funding over a multi-year
period bringing relevant intellectual skills from the more general
research/academic community to bear on the problem. That is to say,
working papers both from within and outside the normal standards community
must be commissioned as the topic requires. 

(To avoid any misunderstanding, let me say that I put forth this
suggestion disinterestedly and am not a candidate for funding or work in
this area.)

This has been a very useful and lively discussion group, and I, for one,
have learned from many of the comments. But all that is different from
producing a standard.  For a successful effort, a synergy between
institutional arrangements and software design is needed.
