Sorry, Jim, 
	.		I was only having a bit of fun. 

	.	Nevertheless, while you and I both know inertia is a
property of mass, not of velocity, I have been pulled up several times over
the years, over the point that most people associate it with sluggishness in
getting moving. 

	.	And, as was pointed out on many of those occasions, it has
to be admitted that "momentum" carries with it the implication of movement,
in a way that "inertia" doesn't.

Graham,

	'Momentum' may be a better choice, but 'inertia' can mean the
tendency, if moving, to keep moving in the same direction.

&gt; 
&gt; Jim, I hope you mean "momentum". 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for having a bit of a joke, tho' I feel a sense of 
&gt; humour is needed at times ...... I have been frequently
&gt; caught on this particular metaphor myself. 
&gt; 
&gt; Naturally, I concur with the thrust of your e-mail.

&gt; Document' for
&gt; SUO WG
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Pat,
&gt; 
&gt; 	You have correctly pointed out some aspects of this vote.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The label "Base Document' does sound of importance, which 
&gt; appears to be a
&gt; sticking point with many of the NO votes.  This is why that label was
&gt; removed from the vote.  It will not be called a Base Document.  
&gt; 
&gt; 2. If we pass this vote and decide to work on this document, this will
&gt; indeed provide some level of inertia for this approach, but 
&gt; it is completely
&gt; within the power of the group to change.  The group could vote to stop
&gt; working on the document, vote to work on a different 
&gt; document, vote to make
&gt; whatever changes it wants, or whatever.  
&gt; 
&gt; 3. But understand, if we don't pass this vote, this means the 
&gt; group will not
&gt; resolve any comments or work to improve the document.  Niles 
&gt; might continue
&gt; on his own, but could we really expect him to continue if the 
&gt; group has
&gt; voted not to work on the document?  Also, if the groups wants 
&gt; the work to
&gt; continue, doesn't it want some control over what gets 
&gt; inserted?   I see no
&gt; logic in the group voting it down but encouraging Niles to 
&gt; continue.  It's
&gt; not like the group is too busy working on other documents.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;To Matthew &amp; John, and all the rest,
&gt; &gt;	.					Based on the 
&gt; principles set
&gt; &gt;out by Jim, the rationale here sounds pretty well like a 
&gt; YES, not a NO, to
&gt; &gt;me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	Basically, the sentiment seems to be that we 
&gt; should continue
&gt; &gt;with the structure Ian has assembled. I may have missed something (I
&gt; haven't
&gt; &gt;read all the discussion on the voting), but I haven't seen 
&gt; anyone arguing
&gt; &gt;for a stop to Ian's work, nor any offer of any alternative proposals.
&gt; 
&gt; There are two issues which need to be clearly separated.  First, 
&gt; should Niles' cease work on his merged ontology? Clearly not; but 
&gt; that doesnt require any kind of vote from us.  Second, should this 
&gt; group somehow officially endorse, certify, provisionally accept, give 
&gt; some kind of special group status to, or otherwise take special note 
&gt; of, Niles' document? This is what I was voting against, largely 
&gt; because I think it is premature to do so.  Now, given the subsequent 
&gt; emails, it appears that the status of 'Base Document' has no actual 
&gt; implication at all. If this is really correct then I will change my 
&gt; vote to ABSTAIN, as the entire voting process seems pointless in this 
&gt; case. However, I hae me doots that this is *really* what the vote 
&gt; means, and suspect that this status of 'Base document', if accepted, 
&gt; will in the future be used to argue that the SUO must be based on 
&gt; Niles' document.
