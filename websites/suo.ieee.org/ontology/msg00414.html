Dear Ian,

Thanks for your responses below. Despite voting "no" I do appreciate the
work you have done. I'm not usre what else you could have done at this
stage. I mostly think the question of accepting the document as a Base
Document was somewhat premature.

See comments below.

Regards

&gt; Document' for SUO
&gt; &gt; WG
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dear James,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As one of the more active participants, I think I should vote 
&gt; &gt; publicly.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I vote NO.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do think it is suitable as a working paper.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I also feel I should give some reasons.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The overall reason is that I would not use it as a start 
&gt; &gt; point for anything
&gt; &gt; that I am currently doing or about to do. I have only had 
&gt; &gt; time to give a
&gt; &gt; brief review of the combined document, however, the following 
&gt; &gt; major sticking
&gt; &gt; points exist for me.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. n-th Domain is still in there, though I'm pleased to see that its
&gt; &gt; siblings seem to have been dropped. N-th domain is equivalent 
&gt; &gt; to writing a
&gt; &gt; different language with KIF and then using that whilst 
&gt; &gt; pretending it is
&gt; &gt; still KIF. Further it is unnecessary, the equivalent 
&gt; &gt; statements can be made
&gt; &gt; in perfectly ordinary KIF.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, 'nth-domain' is really just syntactic sugar.  All 
&gt; formulas involving
&gt; this predicate can be recast, using the template provided in 
&gt; the "Structural
&gt; Ontology" section of the merged ontology document, into 
&gt; uncontroversially
&gt; first order language.  I don't see that this is a problem.

MW: Quite, so why not do it?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. The ontology has a 3D rather than 4D foundation. I can't 
&gt; &gt; imagine going
&gt; &gt; back from 4D to 3D, except to analyse and retrieve useful ideas.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if the merged ontology does indeed have a "3D" foundation, this
&gt; foundation could, it seems to me, be embedded within a "4D" 
&gt; framework.  If
&gt; you disagree, could you indicate why you think this is impossible?

MW: You will have seen that Pat has raised some doubts about the possibility
of doing this. The problem arises if 3D and 4D viewpoints are extended
subsets of each other. I am more hopeful, in moving from a 3D world to 4D I
have not noticed anything I have lost, only things gained, so I am prepared
to bet that a 3D viewpoint can be mapped onto a 4D viewpoint. What I am
prepared to bet is some effort to try to make the mapping - I believe in
experiment as much as analysis for making progress.

MW: This could get quite messy. For instance, what I pick up from Pat is
that a 4D object may not be a member of a 3D class, but from a 4D object and
its classes, we may be able to infer a 3D object and its classes/properties
etc, and vice-versa (within the limits of what can be represented in 3D
and/or 4D).

MW: I have a high level model for a 4D viewpoint, a subset of which might be
a suitable start point for this. The main issue is that it is in EXPRESS
(ISO10303-11) an entity-relationship language, and not KIF, so it would need
translation. Further, it is mostly structural at present with relatively few
axioms.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. The foundation is John Sowa's lattice of classes, and 
&gt; whilst I will
&gt; &gt; defend another mans right to use whatever classes he chooses, 
&gt; &gt; and am happy
&gt; &gt; to find these classes interesting, for me they do not provide a firm
&gt; &gt; foundation. The primary reason for this is their basis in Pierce's
&gt; &gt; Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness, concepts which in trying 
&gt; &gt; to grasp them,
&gt; &gt; remind me more of jelly than something I would care to build 
&gt; &gt; on - each time
&gt; &gt; I have thought I had them nailed down, they moved on me.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that Pierce's tripartite distinction is a stumbling 
&gt; block for its
&gt; broad acceptance in an engineering context (whatever 
&gt; philosophical merits it
&gt; may have).  It is for precisely this reason that I removed 
&gt; the associated
&gt; notions (e.g. 'Mediating' versus 'Relative', 'Prehension', 
&gt; etc.) in the
&gt; latest version of the merged ontology.

MW: But then you are left with a bunch of classes without a foundation at
all. 

MW: With something I don't understand, I try to get down into subtypes and
instances. So from a 4D perspective if we can get down to things that are
relatively concrete, these could be mapped to a 4D model, you could then see
the superclasses as defined by their subclasses and example members, and
thus get a better grip on Firstness, secondness, and thirdness.

MW: Be careful though, what you are then talking about is really multiple
ontologies, and how they relate to each other. This would enable people to
use the ontology most relevant to their needs, but express the same thing in
another ontology, when that was more appropriate. I think these are
important things to (try) to do, but I wouldn't want to suggest it was easy.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. The axioms on entity and class require that all classes 
&gt; &gt; are a subtype of
&gt; &gt; entity. This means that no class can have classes as members. 
&gt; &gt; This is very
&gt; &gt; restrictive.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that this is a problem, and it is one that Pay Hayes 
&gt; noted as well.
&gt; I suggest that we proceed by asking John Sowa to present his 
&gt; view on why the
&gt; axioms should be retained.

MW: Did I miss something? I didn't see John propose this. If retained, this
would be more restrictive than entity relationship modelling, and it was the
restrictions there that lead me to look at logic based approaches in the
first place.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 5. I could create a similar list of questions and concerns as 
&gt; &gt; Pat has done
&gt; &gt; on the details of the ontology. I do not have the time this 
&gt; &gt; would take at
&gt; &gt; present - I can't decide whether that is fortunate or 
&gt; &gt; unfortunate, and for
&gt; &gt; whom.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is not necessarily an exhaustive list, but for me it is 
&gt; &gt; sufficient. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards  
&gt; &gt;       Matthew

&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: SUO: Vote on Merged Ontology as a 'Base Document' 
&gt; &gt; for SUO WG
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUO Participants,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Attached is the latest version of Ian Niles'  Merged 
&gt; Ontology.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. This message is a call for a vote as to whether this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; document should be
&gt; &gt; &gt; approved as a 'Base Document' for IEEE P1600.1 Standard 
&gt; &gt; Upper Ontology
&gt; &gt; &gt; Working Group.  Within IEEE, there is no official 
&gt; &gt; definition of a Base
&gt; &gt; &gt; Document; however, the definitions below from the IEEE 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Learning Technology
&gt; &gt; &gt; Standards Committee (our original sponsor) are as good as any.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; consensus we have
&gt; &gt; &gt; for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to decide if we
&gt; &gt; &gt; are going to go down this path or not.  Multiple base 
&gt; documents are
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible, so anyone else is free to submit one.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose 
&gt; &gt; &gt; improvements to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; document, unless they are major enough for you to vote 
&gt; &gt; &gt; against focusing work
&gt; &gt; &gt; on this document.  However, such general improvement comments 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are welcome
&gt; &gt; &gt; and will be resolved (but not until after completion of this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Base Document
&gt; &gt; &gt; vote). 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Since we are still in the process of establishing official 
&gt; &gt; &gt; voting rights,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw 
&gt; &gt; poll, such that
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; consensus is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (once voting
&gt; &gt; &gt; rights are established).  
&gt; &gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), 
&gt; NO (comments
&gt; &gt; &gt; required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Please send your votes directly to me (to reduce list 
&gt; &gt; &gt; traffic), though
&gt; &gt; &gt; you may send them to the entire list if you desire.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 8. Please vote by Jan 29, 2001. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 9. Please send in any questions or comments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Chair, SUO WG
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; IEEE LTSC Nomenclature of Documents 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working paper: Does not automatically get agenda time. Not 
&gt; &gt; necessarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; related to standards words (e.g., liaison reports, the agenda 
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself). A
&gt; &gt; &gt; working paper is any document with a document number or a document
&gt; &gt; &gt; introduced at a meeting (assuming the WG accepts it as a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working paper).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Working papers don't automatically receive agenda time. The 
&gt; &gt; &gt; WG Chair may
&gt; &gt; &gt; choose to give higher agenda priority to discussion on 
&gt; &gt; working papers
&gt; &gt; &gt; received two weeks prior to the meeting. (Members may object 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; on papers with less than two weeks notice, but the objection 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is based on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to digest the document, not to obstruct the process; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the objection
&gt; &gt; &gt; may prevent the paper from get agenda time, but not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily prevent the
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion -- be considerate both ways, the chair will rule.) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; base document: Starting point for standards words (it's clear 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the document
&gt; &gt; &gt; *can* be transformed into standards words). Has no official 
&gt; &gt; &gt; weight (not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard). Might not be in standards wording. Might not be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; complete with
&gt; &gt; &gt; respect to the scope and/or final standard. Might be multiple base
&gt; &gt; &gt; documents. Automatically allocated agenda time since this 
&gt; &gt; is the main
&gt; &gt; &gt; product of the WG. Most base documents represent substantial 
&gt; &gt; &gt; work created
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside the committee and introduced into the WG. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working draft: The base documents (assuming more than one) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are combined over
&gt; &gt; &gt; time. The combination document now becomes a working draft. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The working
&gt; &gt; &gt; draft is refined and polished. The working draft is adapted 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the style
&gt; &gt; &gt; guides. Working drafts may be available to the public. 
&gt; Automatically
&gt; &gt; &gt; allocated agenda time (the rest below all have agenda time). 
&gt; &gt; &gt; base document vs. working draft: There may be multiple base 
&gt; &gt; &gt; documents that
&gt; &gt; &gt; become the starting points for a standard. There is only one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working draft
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a standard (but many revisions, each with its own 
&gt; &gt; &gt; document number). A
&gt; &gt; &gt; base document identifies the origin of the work for 
&gt; several reasons:
&gt; &gt; &gt; technical, rationale, intellectual property, acknowledgement. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; committee draft: The working draft is now in the style of a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; document substatially represents the intended final standard. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Changes may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; made. There may be several committee drafts. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working draft vs. committee draft: Each revision of the 
&gt; &gt; working draft
&gt; &gt; &gt; represents a batch of edits that the WG accepts. Typically, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a new
&gt; &gt; &gt; working draft each meeting while the document is being 
&gt; &gt; developed, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; working drafts may be less frequent. Committee drafts are 
&gt; important
&gt; &gt; &gt; milestones because they represent to the public "this is what 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the final
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard will look like". Working drafts may be available or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; not to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; public. Committe drafts are public. Working drafts may be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; used to solicit
&gt; &gt; &gt; public comments. Committee drafts are always used to 
&gt; solicit public
&gt; &gt; &gt; comments. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; draft standard: The document is *complete*. There may be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; minor editoral
&gt; &gt; &gt; changes, but no substantive changes are intended. Draft 
&gt; &gt; &gt; standards may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; referred to (i.e., incorporated by reference) in *other* 
&gt; standards. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; approved standard: The document is now an official standard. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Summary: Committee members submit working papers. Working 
&gt; &gt; &gt; papers may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; related to committee work, technical contributions, and 
&gt; so on. Base
&gt; &gt; &gt; documents are working papers approved as a "base document". 
&gt; &gt; &gt; One or more base
&gt; &gt; &gt; documents may be part of a standard. When base documents are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; revised they
&gt; &gt; &gt; become a new working paper but with the automatic agenda 
&gt; &gt; &gt; item. At some point
&gt; &gt; &gt; the working papers and/or base documents are combined to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; become a working
&gt; &gt; &gt; draft. Later on, additional working papers and additional 
&gt; &gt; &gt; base documents may
&gt; &gt; &gt; be added to the working draft. Working drafts may be made 
&gt; &gt; &gt; available for
&gt; &gt; &gt; public comment. Committee drafts represent the full 
&gt; intention of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard. Committee drafts are available for public comment 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and are likely
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be balloted (comments from voting and non-voting 
&gt; &gt; members). A draft
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard represents the completed standard in every way 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (wording, style,
&gt; &gt; &gt; layout, etc.) except that it is not official. An approved 
&gt; &gt; &gt; draft standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; becomes a official standard after a succesful ballot and a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; process review.
