Graham,

Yes, I have also been recommending controlled languages for
a long time.

&gt;While what you say is true, It does not relate to what I was
&gt;suggesting for the SUO.  

&gt;Also, I believe your statements exaggerate the extent to
&gt;which a carefully thought out and appropriately restricted and modified
&gt;version of Standard English cannot be developed for programming, database
&gt;development and more generalised computer - human dialogue, etc. 

I believe that such tools can be very useful, but I want to
distinguish them from the kind of hype that keeps appearing
in press releases.  That kind of hype is one of the greatest
obstacles to getting people to take controlled languages
seriously.

&gt;I feel you are quoting hyped up "press release"
&gt;overstatements to exaggerate up your position. Who would believe a newspaper

&gt;or other journal article with that sort of language anyway? 

Unfortunately, such hype tends to be generated at least as
often by the developers of the tools as by the journalists.
In those two quotations I cited, the journalists may have
written the words, but they were seriously misled by the
people they interviewed.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Although I believe that controlled English is a useful way to make
&gt;statements in logic more readable, I want to emphasize that it is not a
&gt;panacea.  It will definitely not make it possible for nonprogrammers to
&gt;"write programs in English." 
&gt;
&gt;For some perspective on this point, I would like to cite an excerpt from a

&gt;recent issue of NewScientist:
&gt;
&gt;"Now a new system that takes the drudgery - and some of the potential for
&gt;slip-ups -- out of programming is about to be launched. Its inventor hopes

&gt;it will one day turn us all into programmers.  Bob Brennan, a software
&gt;engineer at Cambridge- based start-up Synapse Solutions, has developed a
&gt;piece of software that allows you to write a program by keying in what you

&gt;want it to do in everyday language."
&gt;
&gt;Source:  <A  HREF="http://www.newscientist.com/tech/yourwish.jsp">http://www.newscientist.com/tech/yourwish.jsp</A>
&gt;
&gt;That the above claims are every bit as believable as the claims in the
&gt;following excerpt, which was published in the February 1981 issue of
&gt;Personal Computer World:
&gt;
&gt;"While the rest of the world has been developing a series of ever higher
&gt;level languages, two men in Somerset, David James and Scotty Bambury, have

&gt;quietly created a system which actually removes the need for program
&gt;coding....  The system not only produces bug free code but it also does it

&gt;jolly quickly - a matter of a few minutes once the design details have been

&gt;keyed in. Since it keeps a record of the program design, this can be
&gt;modified at any time and new programs generated on the spot. This means
&gt;that, for the first time in his life, the user can change his mind or modify

&gt;his system without it costing him an arm and a leg. For the first time, too,

&gt;ordinary people can implement their ideas on a computer without having to
&gt;worry about expensive `experts' or the rigours of learning to program.
&gt;Programmers on the other hand should find their jobs enriched, getting their

&gt;intellectual satisfaction from program design and avoiding the tedium of
&gt;coding and debugging."

&gt;
&gt;One can find similar press releases going back to the 1960s.
