More Thread On Information, Inquiry, Logic, Signs:

&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Continuation Of Previous Note:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; SUO, S.A., FOO,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would like to address some of the unities that are manifested
&gt; &gt; among the concepts of information, inquiry, logic, and signs,
&gt; &gt; along with the brands of theoretical integration that are
&gt; &gt; possible among their respective efforts of theory,
&gt; &gt; that is to say, at least, their up-until-now
&gt; &gt; largely several and mostly separate efforts
&gt; &gt; toward any sort of an adequate theory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Hello there, Some Of The Unities ..."
&gt; &gt; &lt; Art Carney or Jackie Gleason voice,
&gt; &gt; | I cannot remember which right now &gt;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, I am trying to make this address positive, that is to say,
&gt; &gt; in the sense of addressing the conventionally-called "positive"
&gt; &gt; side of each concept in the list, but just in case the bearing
&gt; &gt; on some of our previous discussions is not clear, I probably ought
&gt; &gt; to mention that this address also addresses, albeit in an indirect way,
&gt; &gt; the disintegrities that we have noticed among our concepts, our terms,
&gt; &gt; and our "rough and ready" but a bit "faute de mieux" theories, such as
&gt; &gt; they are, of ambiguity, discrepancy, disparity, divergence, diversity,
&gt; &gt; ellipticity, enthymemacity, equivocality, fuzziness, generality, hyperbole,
&gt; &gt; indefiniteness, indefinity, indeterminacy, metaphor, mutagenicity, parabole,
&gt; &gt; uncertainty, vagueness, and all the rest of their vast and very unruly clan.
&gt; 
&gt; I forgot to mention digression, dispersion, dissipation, ...
&gt; 
&gt; When it comes to the Topic of Logic, I will revert to my customary practice
&gt; of beginning at the bottom and trying to work up, that is, of starting with
&gt; the humble preliminaries of propositional calculus, whose name is legion --
&gt; "If you can't make it there, you can't make it anywhere" -- and rather than
&gt; following Frege's model-theoretic practice of saying that Truth and Falsity
&gt; are objects that may be denoted by propositional signs under a contemplated
&gt; choice of interpretation -- at least, that is how I remember it from many
&gt; years back, but I am just about to make my periodic review of the sources
&gt; on this question, any day now -- I will follow what I take to be the more
&gt; preferable practice of saying that a propositional sign denotes a certain
&gt; form of matter, a pattern of content, a realization of potential, in short,
&gt; a function of the type f : B^k -&gt; B, for suitable k and where B = {0, 1},
&gt; the latter interpreted as logical values:  0 = F = Falsity, 1 = T = Truth.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to make the connection between Logic and Information,
&gt; I observe that the function that a propositional sign denotes is
&gt; just the "square-wave" or the "step-function" approximation to the
&gt; sorts of "frequency distributions" or "probability densities" that
&gt; we find so basic to our present-day "Theory Of Information" (TOI).
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a sufficient example to convey the basic picture:
&gt; 
&gt; For the proposition AB, that is, A&amp;B, we have
&gt; AB depicted as a function of type f : B^2 -&gt; B,
&gt; and AB illustrated by means of a venn diagram:
&gt; 
&gt;    1 ^      o--o
&gt;      |      |%%|
&gt;      |      |%%|
&gt;    0 o------o  o--------&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;     AB = 10, 11, 01, 00
&gt; 
&gt;      o----------------o
&gt;      |     /\  /\     |
&gt;      |    /  \/  \    |
&gt;      |   /   /\   \   |
&gt;      |  / A /%%\ B \  |
&gt;      |  \   \%%/   /  |
&gt;      |   \   \/   /   |
&gt;      |    \  /\  /    |
&gt;      |     \/  \/     |
&gt;      o----------------o
&gt; 
&gt; It is my belief, and unless the most of you already agree
&gt; it will become my task to argue later on, that a complete
&gt; understanding of information theory obviates the need for
&gt; any further "theory of fuzziness" (TOF), that is, for all
&gt; practical purposes, anyway.  Of course, in asserting this,
&gt; I am anticipating my usage of Peirce's qualitative version
&gt; of TOI, which he derived from purely logical considerations,
&gt; in effect, from his earliest ideas about the theory of signs,
&gt; long before he came to devise a logarithmic measure for the
&gt; quantitative analysis of information content.  And you can
&gt; look it up!

I think that it might be a good idea to draw a few more pictures,
and also to notice a slightly different manner of executing and
interpreting what is roughly the same genre of iconography.

Here is a mini-review of the pictures for the propositional expression "A and B",
which I am more accustomed to write in the form of an indicated product, as "AB":

   1 ^      o--o
     |      |%%|
     |      |%%|
   0 o------o  o------&gt;

    AB = 10, 11, 01, 00

     o----------------o
     |     /\  /\     |
     |    /  \/  \    |
     |   /   /\   \   |
     |  / A /%%\ B \  |
     |  \   \%%/   /  |
     |   \   \/   /   |
     |    \  /\  /    |
     |     \/  \/     |
     o----------------o

The legend "AB = 10, 11, 01, 00" lists the four instantiations or
interpretations of the conjunction AB, and the shaded regions that
lie under the graph of the function AB : BxB -&gt; B, and again inside
the cell given by &lt;A, B&gt; = &lt;1, 1&gt; of the venn diagram, respectively,
indicate the loci where AB = 1.

This form of picture treats the points in the domain of the proposition
as if they were already "pre-coded" by their boolean coordinates in B^2,
but we are usually interested in more arbitrary domains of propositions.
For instance, suppose that we have in mind a space X, say of things, or
times, or spacetime loci, over which given propositions are evaluated.

By way of formulating a concrete example, let X be taken as a time dimension,
and let x in X be a real number, where X = R.  In such an interpretive case,
the proposition-signs "A", "B", "AB", and "(A(B))" indicate "times when
the denoted propositions A, B, AB, and (A(B)), respectively, are true".

To see it in pictures:

     |%%%%%\/%%\/%%%%%|
     o----------------o

----------------------------

If this is starting to sound a little bit familiar,
it may be because the relationship between the two
kinds of pictures of propositions, namely:

1.  Propositions about things in general, here,
    about the times when certain facts are true,
    having the form of functions f : X -&gt; B,

2.  Propositions about binary codes, here, about
    the bit-vector labels on venn diagram cells,
    having the form of functions f' : B^k -&gt; B,

is an epically old story, one that I, myself,
have related one or twice upon a time before,
to wit, at least, at the following two cites:

<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg01251.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg01251.html</A>
<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg01293.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg01293.html</A>

There, and now here, once more, and again, it may be observed
that the relation is one whereby the proposition f : X -&gt; B,
the one about things and times and mores in general, factors
into a coding function c : X -&gt; B^k, followed by a derived
proposition f' : B^k -&gt; B that judges the resulting codes.

|                       f
|                   X ----&gt; B
|                    \     ^
|   &lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt; \   / f'
|                      \ /
|                       .
|                      B^k
|
| You may remember that this was supposed to illustrate
| the "factoring" of a proposition f : X -&gt; B = {0, 1}
| into the composition f'(c(x)), where c : X -&gt; B^k is
| the "coding" of each x in X as an k-bit string in B^k,
| and where f' is the mapping of codes into a co-domain
| that we interpret as t-f-values, B = {0, 1} = {F, T}.

Enough For The Present,

Jon Awbrey
