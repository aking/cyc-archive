Arrgghh... In my haste to be *first*, I created a typo. My answer should
have been:

&gt; 1. a
&gt; 2. a

Sigh... (if that's not vacillation, what is?)

&gt; &gt; I am afraid that the problem is rather with getting any human being
&gt; &gt; to pick just one entre from such menu -- so far in the SUO group,
&gt; &gt; I have never seen it happen, nor have I been able yet to get
&gt; &gt; a straight answer from anybody here, and doesn't it always
&gt; &gt; seem to go that the people who affect being fussy about
&gt; &gt; ambiguities are the pickiest eaters in this regard,
&gt; &gt; stubbornly maintaining their own excesses and
&gt; &gt; vacillations while hawking their low-fat
&gt; &gt; diets to others?
&gt;
&gt; OK, if it gives me a chance to be *first* at something :-), then
&gt; based on the comments I've given below, I'll take the dietary
&gt; plunge and answer your questionnaire. (April fools rush in...)
&gt;
&gt; Here goes:

&gt; 1. a
&gt; 2. b
&gt;
&gt; One caveat, and standard disclaimer. In giving these answers I am
&gt; open to reasoning that might cause me to change these answers...

&gt; In particular, I am toying with the idea of saying that the

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks very much for your analysis of Peirce CP 5:569 relative to
&gt; &gt; meaning-preserving translation. It seems that another relevant
&gt; &gt; quote along the same lines is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "A sign stands for something to the idea which it produces, or
&gt; &gt; modifies. Or, it is a vehicle conveying into the mind something
&gt; &gt; from without. That for which it stands is called its object; that
&gt; &gt; which it conveys, its meaning; and the idea to which it gives
&gt; &gt; rise, its interpretant. The object of representation can be
&gt; &gt; nothing but a representation of which the first representation is
&gt; &gt; the interpretant. But an endless series of representations, each
&gt; &gt; representing the one behind it, may be conceived to have an
&gt; &gt; absolute object at its limit. The meaning of a representation can
&gt; &gt; be nothing but a representation. In fact, it is nothing but the
&gt; &gt; representation itself conceived as stripped of irrelevant
&gt; &gt; clothing. But this clothing never can be completely stripped off;
&gt; &gt; it is only changed for something more diaphanous. So there is an
&gt; &gt; infinite regression here. Finally, the interpretant is nothing
&gt; &gt; but another representation to which the torch of truth is handed
&gt; &gt; along; and as representation, it has its interpretant again. Lo,
&gt; &gt; another infinite series." CP 1:339
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I understand this approach correctly, then I do not doubt its
&gt; &gt; validity, yet I am bothered by the definition of "truth" in terms
&gt; &gt; of translations of a proposition between a potentially infinite
&gt; &gt; set of different ways the proposition could be stated in
&gt; &gt; different languages.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that when we perceive a statement is true, our perception
&gt; &gt; of truth must be finite. At most it would seem that we could use
&gt; &gt; some finite form of meta-reasoning, or perhaps a finite form of
&gt; &gt; induction, to deduce that a proposition must be true in each of
&gt; &gt; an infinite set of all possible circumstances relevant to that
&gt; &gt; proposition... This would seem a promising approach toward
&gt; &gt; finitizing the concept of truth in such cases...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Two other quotes, which I like better, from Peirce are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Deduction is that mode of reasoning which examines the state of
&gt; &gt; things asserted in the premisses, forms a diagram of that state
&gt; &gt; of things, perceives in the parts of that diagram relations not
&gt; &gt; explicitly mentioned in the premisses, satisfies itself by mental
&gt; &gt; experiments upon the diagram that these relations would always
&gt; &gt; subsist, or at least would do so in a  certain proportion of
&gt; &gt; cases, and concludes their necessary, or probable, truth." - CP 1:66
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Induction is that mode of reasoning which adopts a conclusion as
&gt; &gt; approximate, because it results from a method of inference which
&gt; &gt; must generally lead to the truth in the long run. For example, a
&gt; &gt; ship enters port laden with coffee. I go aboard and sample the
&gt; &gt; coffee. Perhaps I do not examine over a hundred beans, but they
&gt; &gt; have been taken from the middle, top, and bottom of bags in every
&gt; &gt; part of the hold. I conclude by induction that the whole cargo
&gt; &gt; has approximately the same value per bean as the hundred beans of
&gt; &gt; my sample. All that induction can do is to ascertain the value of
&gt; &gt; a ratio." - CP 1:67
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What I like about these quotes are the explicit references to
&gt; &gt; "observation" as a component of determining that a proposition
&gt; is true...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Quite often we are concerned with the truth of propositions not
&gt; &gt; in all possible worlds, but only in certain contexts, and limited
&gt; &gt; to certain times and places. Thus when I say "it is raining", I
&gt; &gt; am asserting a proposition to be true in a very limited context,
&gt; &gt; time and place. The truth of my proposition depends on whether I
&gt; &gt; and others who are observing the same context, at the same time
&gt; &gt; and place, would agree that the statement correctly describes
&gt; &gt; what is happening.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Granted, an unlimited number of different people could have
&gt; &gt; different interpretants (internal conceptual structures) all
&gt; &gt; representing that it is raining. Yet I do not need to reason
&gt; &gt; about all the infinity of different possible conceptual
&gt; &gt; structures they may have. Rather, I need to somehow know that my
&gt; &gt; own perceptions tell me it is raining, and that I describe these
&gt; &gt; perceptions by the sign / phrase "it is raining", and I need to
&gt; &gt; know that most often whenever I say "it is raining", other people
&gt; &gt; agree with me, and that most often whenever other people say "it
&gt; &gt; is raining", I agree with them -- which seems to be a form of
&gt; &gt; finite induction... Though how we all learn to say "it is
&gt; &gt; raining" in response to the same kinds of situations is another,
&gt; &gt; "Gavagai" problem...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Generally, it seems to me that a predicate is a sign representing
&gt; &gt; a kind of property, relationship, event, situation, etc., that
&gt; &gt; may be asserted to exist, and which may involve other referents.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A predication, or proposition (in general, I would use the terms
&gt; &gt; synonymously) would then be a "complex sign" involving the use of
&gt; &gt; a predicate along with signs representing one or more referents,
&gt; &gt; to refer to the existence of a property, relationship, event,
&gt; &gt; situation, etc. involving one or more referents.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Whether a predication is true or false then, in general, would
&gt; &gt; depend upon the observation of an agent, to verify whether the
&gt; &gt; state of affairs claimed by the proposition actually exists. A
&gt; &gt; proposition is considered to be true iff one observes that the
&gt; &gt; referent (property, relationship, etc.) that it refers to
&gt; &gt; actually exists, within a certain context, space and time where
&gt; &gt; the proposition is being considered.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It would seem then that the "meaning" of a proposition is its
&gt; &gt; referent, i.e. it is whatever property, relationship, event,
&gt; &gt; situation, etc. that the proposition refers to. A proposition is
&gt; &gt; meaningful iff its meaning exists, i.e. iff the proposition is
&gt; &gt; true according to the observation of some agent.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This approach seems close to that of a Russellian proposition, as
&gt; &gt; described by Robert C. Moore in "Logic and Representation", yet
&gt; &gt; it also seems possible to define in terms of Peircean semiotics...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, these are just some preliminary thoughts, and I would
&gt; &gt; very much appreciate your comments, and those of others, about them...

&gt; &gt; "Truth is the conformity of a representamen to its object, *its*
&gt; &gt; object, ITS object, mind you. The International Dictionary at the
&gt; &gt; writer's elbow, the Century Dictionary which he daily studies,
&gt; &gt; the Standard which he would be glad sometimes to consult, all
&gt; &gt; contain the word yes; but that word is not true simply because he
&gt; &gt; is going to ask on this eighth of January 1906, in Pike County,
&gt; &gt; Pennsylvania, whether it is snowing. There must be an action of
&gt; &gt; the object upon the sign to render the latter true. Without that,
&gt; &gt; the object is not the representamen's object. [...] Here is a
&gt; &gt; view of the writer's house: what makes that house to be the
&gt; &gt; object of the view? Surely not the similarity of appearance.
&gt; &gt; There are ten thousand others in the country just like it. No,
&gt; &gt; but the photographer set up the film in such a way that according
&gt; &gt; to the laws of optics, the film was forced to receive an image of
&gt; &gt; this house. What the sign virtually has to do in order to
&gt; &gt; indicate its object -- and make it its -- all it has to do is
&gt; &gt; just to seize its interpreter's eyes and forcibly turn them upon
&gt; &gt; the object meant: it is what a knock at the door does, or an
&gt; &gt; alarm or other bell, or a whistle, a cannon-shot, etc. It is pure
&gt; &gt; physiological compulsion; nothing else. ..." CP 5:554

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Phil,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for bringing that quotation into the fray.  I believe
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I am using the word "proposition" in a way that is quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; consistent with Peirce's usage:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"But even if it were impossible to distinguish between truth
&gt; &gt; and reality,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that would not in the least prevent our defining what it is
&gt; that truth
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consists in. Truth and falsity are characters confined to
&gt; &gt; &gt; propositions.  A
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;proposition is a sign which separately indicates its object.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Peirce is explicitly saying that a proposition is a sign.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But CSP elsewhere drew a distinction between a sign instance,
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as an occurrence of the word "the", and a sign type, such
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the word "the" as the syntactic form of a sign.  Both of
&gt; &gt; &gt; them are, according to CSP, signs.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; For my definition of meaning-preserving translation (MPT),
&gt; &gt; &gt; I defined a proposition as an equivalence class of sentences.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Each sentence, as uttered, is a sign instance.  Each sentence
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a syntactic construct is a sign type.  My propositions are
&gt; &gt; &gt; a class of sign types in one or more languages.  That class
&gt; &gt; &gt; represents the supertype of all the sign types that have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; same interpretants in all those languages.  It too is a sign
&gt; &gt; &gt; type.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Thus, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;portrait with the name of the original below it is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; proposition. It asserts
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that if anybody looks at it, he can form a reasonably correct
&gt; &gt; idea of how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the original looked.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that a portrait by itself would not be a proposition
&gt; &gt; &gt; because there would be no indication of its object.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; addition of the name plus the convention that a name below
&gt; &gt; &gt; a portrait indicates the name of the person portrayed adds
&gt; &gt; &gt; the necessary connection between the form (picture) and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; object (person).  That is why I require condition #3 of
&gt; &gt; &gt; vocabulary preserving in my definition of MPT.  Without
&gt; &gt; &gt; that condition, one could claim that the following three
&gt; &gt; &gt; sentences "express the same proposition":
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  1. "Every cat is a cat."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  2. "Every dog is a dog."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  3. "Every unicorn is a unicorn."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; All three of these sentences have the same logical form,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and all three would have the denotation true in every
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible world.  But their content words have different
&gt; &gt; &gt; referents (and "unicorn" has no referent in our world).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A sign is only a sign in actu by virtue of its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;receiving an interpretation, that is, by virtue of its
&gt; &gt; &gt; determining another
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sign of the same object. This is as true of mental judgments
&gt; &gt; as it is of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;external signs. To say that a proposition is true is to say
&gt; that every
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;interpretation of it is true. Two propositions are equivalent
&gt; &gt; when either
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;might have been an interpretant of the other.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly.  A proposition, as I defined it, is a supertype
&gt; &gt; &gt; of equivalent propositions as stated in multiple languages.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This equivalence, like others,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is by an act of abstraction (in the sense in which forming an
&gt; &gt; &gt; abstract noun
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is abstraction) conceived as identity. And we speak of believing in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;proposition, having in mind an entire collection of equivalent
&gt; &gt; &gt; propositions
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with their partial interpretants.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I couldn't have said it better.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, two persons are said to have the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;same proposition in mind. The interpretant of a proposition
&gt; is itself a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;proposition. Any necessary inference from a proposition is an
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretant
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed.  That is condition #2 of proof preserving for an MPT.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When we speak of truth and falsity, we refer to the possibility of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the proposition being refuted; and this refutation (roughly
&gt; &gt; &gt; speaking) takes
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;place in but one way. Namely, an interpretant of the proposition
&gt; &gt; &gt; would, if
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;believed, produce the expectation of a certain description of
&gt; &gt; &gt; percept on a
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;certain occasion. The occasion arrives: the percept forced upon us is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;different. This constitutes the falsity of every proposition
&gt; &gt; of which the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;disappointing prediction was the interpretant.	Thus, a
&gt; &gt; &gt; false proposition is
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a proposition of which some interpretant represents that, on
&gt; &gt; an occasion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;which it indicates, a percept will have a certain character,
&gt; while the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;immediate perceptual judgment on that occasion is that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; percept has not
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that character. A true proposition is a proposition belief in
&gt; &gt; which would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;never lead to such disappointment so long as the proposition is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;understood otherwise than it was intended." CP 5:569

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; describe as "Peirce's informal statement" into formal terms
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is a translation that alters significant aspects of its meaning.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What "significant aspects" do you claim I have altered?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I should have been more precise in saying that
&gt; &gt; &gt; a proposition is "a supertypere" of all the sign types in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the equivalence class instead of saying that it "is" the
&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalence class.  But since a supertype of a type of s
&gt; &gt; &gt; is itself a type of s, a proposition is also a sign type.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll revise my previous definition to say that a
&gt; &gt; &gt; proposition is the supertype of all the sentence types
&gt; &gt; &gt; in several different languages that are in the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; equivalence class, as determined by some MPT.
