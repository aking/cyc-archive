Jon,  
	.	I'm sorry you feel frustrated, because I feel there are ways
to rise above the issues that I see as troubling you. 

	.	I feel the difference is that I am concentrating on the
conceptual design level. The issues that I see as troubling you tend to
happen at the detail design / implementation level, as per my recent e-mail
below yours. 

	.	I suggest the SUO doesn't have to deal with that level,
other than to say that systems that don't perform iaw the SUO are
non-compliant. Then, the software developers can have their battles with the
chip and operating system developers, to get the latter to comply fully with
the specification. 

	.	That last-mentioned matter is largely one of people cutting
corners to get a cheaper "quickie" product, rather than one that actually
fully complies with the specification. That is further complicated by legal
IP issues that drive people to deliberately design differences into their
products, so as not to be subject to royalty payments. 

	.	The whole field of IP is an ethical and commercial minefield
of its own. I won't go into my attitudes to that are(n)a here. 


John and David
	.		This probably further explains for you whence my
approach derives. 



	.	In my experience, if one analyses, determines and takes into
account the reasons for things, it is far easier to see many of the avenues
open to dealing with problems / challenges.

This is an object(code) example of what Quine calls the "radical
indeterminacy of translation" (RIOT), which means that translations within
what appears to be the "same language" are often more difficult than
translations between what are OS-tensibly or putatively.com "different
languages", as I think, by the way, that I have amply illustrated with darn
near every breadth that I take.

John, 
	.	Thank you for this explanation. I agree wholeheartedly with
your comment, and it applied to ForTran when I was using it. You are quite
right to raise this valid distinction. 

	.	For the reason you state, a "language" is really restricted
to its implementation on a particular machine model and OS. Nevertheless, a
large portion of most languages, especially those with defining standards,
will be common across most of them, so that much software will operate
identically across them also. 

	.	I also acknowledge, and frequently experience, the painful
truth of your last paragraph, since many products don't achieve that goal
consistently. 

	.	Nevertheless, I believe we can separate these facts from the
principles that we can use to develop the SUO. 

	.	What we want to develop is a basic design, not an
implementation. 

	.	This means we don't have to face that particular problem,
which is just as well, since we have many others to face instead.

Graham,

The problem that Doug and I have been discussing is the very painful one
that plagues any programmer who has to convert a working program from one
compiler to another, even on identical hardware.

&gt;Allowing for the severely restricted vocabulary, if I communicate to you in
&gt;a computer language in which you are literate, surely you will understand
&gt;precisely what I say? 

Unfortunately, the most popular programming languages currently in use are
not as well standardized as one might be led to believe.  What is called the
"C language" by one software company is not identical to the "C language" by
another company or even by the same company with different versions of the
compiler.  The differences are serious even with the same operating system
on the same hardware.  They get worse when you go to different OSes on
different hardware.

People who develop products that run on multiple platforms have to go to
enormous expense to accommodate the differences between compilers for "the
same language".

John Sowa
