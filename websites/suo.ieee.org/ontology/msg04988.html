&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; All:
&gt; 
&gt; I've only been monitoring this forum for a few months, but 
&gt; only recently
&gt; have I read comments about the need for an ontological framework to be
&gt; &quot;evolutionary&quot;, to avoid being rigidly constrained by axioms, 
&gt; etc. I am very
&gt; gratified to hear such comments.
&gt; 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; JF: As someone pointed out in a previous thread, try telling 
&gt; engineers at GM
&gt; that their products are anything other than automobiles!
&gt; 
&gt; TJ: me, perhaps? Well, ok, I'll say it. I do suspect that 
&gt; most engineers at
&gt; GM would say that their products include other things than 
&gt; automobiles.
&gt; 
&gt; As someone who has designed databases in over a dozen 
&gt; industries, my point,
&gt; in the automobile morphing into some other kind of vehicle example I
&gt; presented a few weeks ago, was that the notion that we have a 
&gt; hard and sharp
&gt; line distinguishing such things as automobiles from the rest 
&gt; of the entirety
&gt; of what's out there, is usually illusory. My experience in designing
&gt; business databases leads me to suspect that given a set of a few dozen
&gt; various vehicles, suitably different from one another, a roomful of GM
&gt; engineers would NOT each come up with the same partitioning 
&gt; of that set of
&gt; vehicles into automobiles vs. non-automobiles. And even if it 
&gt; happened to,
&gt; that would be the exception rather than the rule.
&gt; 
&gt; So what? Well, for one thing, vagaries of these semantic sorts are not
&gt; restricted to the (pejoratively) &quot;philosophical&quot; middle 
&gt; layer. They permeate
&gt; the lower, get real, layer as well, the layer where those 
&gt; concepts show up
&gt; as names of database tables and/or expressions used in the 
&gt; definitions of
&gt; those tables. The real world engineers, and other business 
&gt; subject matter
&gt; experts (SMEs, as we call them), do NOT have a clear 
&gt; conceptual grasp of
&gt; their subject matter, one which a reasonably articulate 
&gt; database analyst
&gt; could extract with a suitable set of questions. What such 
&gt; experts DO have is
&gt; an ability to interpret the result sets they get from their 
&gt; queries, result
&gt; sets which &quot;mean&quot; much less to inexperienced business users 
&gt; of the database
&gt; they came from.
&gt; 
&gt; My &quot;customer&quot; example, in an earlier email today, is one 
&gt; illustration of
&gt; what I mean. Here's another.
&gt; 
&gt; A manufacturing company subtypes its Parts table into Raw 
&gt; Material (RM)
&gt; Parts, Work in Process (WIP) Parts, and Finished Goods (FG) 
&gt; Parts. It also
&gt; subtypes its Standard Bill of Material Components (SBOM) 
&gt; table into the same
&gt; three categories.
&gt; 
&gt; This set of database tables has been in use for three 
&gt; decades, ever since
&gt; they purchased their current materials management system.
&gt; 
&gt; In the course of several weeks of JAD (joint application development)
&gt; sessions, the SMEs informed me that some manufacturing plants 
&gt; take in WIP
&gt; produced in other plants, and manufacture finished goods out 
&gt; of that WIP. In
&gt; those plants, the SBOMs don't begin with raw material, but 
&gt; rather with this
&gt; WIP. Other plants sometimes manufacture WIP, not FG, and send 
&gt; that WIP to
&gt; those other plants.
&gt; 
&gt; That's because raw material is defined as stuff purchased from outside
&gt; vendors, stuff which therefore appears on POs (purchase 
&gt; orders). WIP doesn't
&gt; appear on POs (otherwise the receiving plant might have to 
&gt; pay sales tax on
&gt; it!), and isn't purchased from outside vendors, so it isn't 
&gt; RM. But a WIP
&gt; Part, out of Inventory, will be designated as a lowest level 
&gt; Part in an SBOM
&gt; structure. However, those lowest level Parts, the ones used 
&gt; as input to the
&gt; first step in the Work Order (WO) which uses that SBOM, are 
&gt; instances of the
&gt; RM subtype of the SBOM table. So here's a WIP Part that is 
&gt; considered an
&gt; instance of an RM component of an SBOM!
&gt; 
&gt; This does work! And it will continue work, because the 
&gt; alternative data
&gt; structures I designed will be used for a data warehouse, not 
&gt; to replace this
&gt; &quot;legacy system&quot; database. Mapping, done in an ETL layer 
&gt; (&quot;extract, transform
&gt; and load&quot;) will translate this WIP/RM confusion into a 
&gt; clearer structure.
&gt; 
&gt; What structure? Simple this, that while the subtypes of Part 
&gt; are indeed RM,
&gt; WIP and FG, the subtypes of SBOM are not. SBOM subtypes, instead, are
&gt; Starting Item (SI), Intermediate Item (II) and Ending Item (EI). Most
&gt; plants, and most SBOMs, start with RM as leaf nodes, and end 
&gt; with FG as the
&gt; root node; i.e. they direct the manufacture of finished goods from raw
&gt; material. (By the way, just as RM is what appears on a PO issued to an
&gt; outside vendor, FG is what appears on an Invoice issued to an outside
&gt; customer.)
&gt; 
&gt; In changing the set of tables, I changed the SME's ontology. The old
&gt; ontology worked because it warped the interpretations 
&gt; surrounding it to
&gt; compensate for its inherent confusion. Some of those 
&gt; interpretations were
&gt; expressed in program code, of course. But others were 
&gt; understood only by
&gt; experienced SMEs, and had to be conveyed, word of mouth (such delicate
&gt; issues seldom make their way into formal documentation), to 
&gt; less experienced
&gt; business users.
&gt; 
&gt; Does my new ontology better represent the real world of this company's
&gt; manufacturing processes? Well, it does a better job(!) until a better
&gt; ontology comes along. The old one seemed fine, i.e. seemed to 
&gt; represent what
&gt; the company was doing, until my alternative came along.
&gt; 
&gt; Better to say, as good pragmatists, that my ontology is just 
&gt; better than the
&gt; older one, not a better representation. How is it better? 
&gt; Simply that the
&gt; code which manipulates the database to retrieve data about 
&gt; the company's
&gt; manufacturing will be simpler than the code which performs 
&gt; the corresponding
&gt; function against the legacy database. &quot;Better&quot; means &quot;part of a total
&gt; information system which more fully and clearly presents ontological
&gt; sameness and differences to its users, and which maintains 
&gt; its database out
&gt; of a simpler codebase&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; The SMEs all agree that power users can write SQL against my 
&gt; ontology which
&gt; eschews WIP and RM as lowest level nodes in a SBOM, while the 
&gt; best of such
&gt; users must rely on intermediate derivative tables, created 
&gt; via procedural
&gt; program code, before they can query the legacy database for the same
&gt; information. They agree that there will be little gap between their
&gt; understanding of this part of the manufacturing process and the
&gt; understanding of less experienced business users, than there 
&gt; currently is
&gt; with the legacy system database.
&gt; 
&gt; So what? So let's get rid of the notion, which I have found in several
&gt; contributions to this forum, that down to earth engineers and 
&gt; other business
&gt; experts know the real stuff, and that we effete intellectual 
&gt; philosophers
&gt; and logicians are just playing around with airy fairy stuff. On the
&gt; contrary, an ability to engage in conceptual analysis -- an 
&gt; ability I gained
&gt; from an analytic philosophical education -- will always 
&gt; reveal that that
&gt; down to earth business knowledge is a tissue of hitherto unquestioned
&gt; assumptions, not by a long shot necessarily the best ontology for the
&gt; business those experts are in. It just takes a little training in the
&gt; Socratic elenchus.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, &quot;tissue&quot; is a bit too strong. But I do frequently change 
&gt; a company's
&gt; ontology, as expressed in their database schemas, when I design a data
&gt; warehouse. These changes are not forced on the SMEs. They, 
&gt; and the DBAs and
&gt; programers who are involved, see them as improvements. (They 
&gt; also see them
&gt; as OUR insights, not mine. Good JADs work like that. Database 
&gt; analysts / JAD
&gt; leaders, who just ask &quot;What is a bill of material?&quot;, &quot;What is 
&gt; a customer?&quot;,
&gt; and write down the answer, will just reproduce the 
&gt; ontological assumptions
&gt; of the past in newer technology. Active analysts / JAD 
&gt; leaders, of which I
&gt; consider myself one, will challenge the SMEs. In the bad 
&gt; cases, we end up
&gt; drinking hemlock. But in the good cases, what results is OUR 
&gt; improvements,
&gt; not mine, and a set of SMEs prepared to go out and 
&gt; passionately proseletize
&gt; for the improved ontology.)
&gt; 
&gt; Now a question. Some of the other participants in this forum work for
&gt; businesses -- manfacturing companies, perhaps insurance 
&gt; companies, health
&gt; care companies, credit reporting companies, etc. Has your 
&gt; experience been
&gt; different? Do you feel it is NOT our role to challenge the 
&gt; engineers and
&gt; other SMEs, to initiate a process of changing accepted 
&gt; ontologies? If you do
&gt; feel that, then I guess you would feel that all the 
&gt; ontological problems
&gt; exist in that middle &quot;philosophical&quot; layer. I, on the other 
&gt; hand, use a
&gt; background awareness of that layer to improve the lowest 
&gt; level ontologies of
&gt; my clients.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew, John et al
&gt; 
&gt; I agree fully that constrained models restrict their utility 
&gt; (outside their
&gt; original design intent - sometimes, though, such constraints 
&gt; are important
&gt; to understanding and making use of the meaning of data 
&gt; governed by/described
&gt; by those models).
&gt; 
&gt; I take something else, however, from John's comment about the inherent
&gt; danger of imposing an axiomatic structure.  Not only are the 
&gt; structures
&gt; likely to become restrictive over time (implying a need for 
&gt; change, or for
&gt; &quot;fudging&quot; of the ontology to make newly-discovered or 
&gt; newly-interesting
&gt; information fit with it), but the intermediate levels between
&gt; &quot;thing/top/universal/whatever&quot; and useful terms/concepts may 
&gt; themselves be
&gt; problematic.  From a somewhat oversimplified perspective, 
&gt; (some) top-down
&gt; ontologies and generic data models tend to have the form:
&gt; 
&gt; thing
&gt; philosophical-stuff
&gt; useful-stuff
&gt; 
&gt; and for many analysts, programmers, and subject/domain 
&gt; experts trying to use
&gt; such a framework, the philsophical-stuff is seen as 
&gt; confusing, unnecessary,
&gt; and (as John points out) introducing a new vocabulary in 
&gt; which to express
&gt; what should be familiar and well understood concepts.  As 
&gt; someone pointed
&gt; out in a previous thread, try telling engineers at GM that 
&gt; their products
&gt; are anything other than automobiles!
&gt; 
&gt; There is, of course, a key role for the philosophical-stuff 
&gt; components of
&gt; such an ontology: without it we may not be able to establish 
&gt; correspondences
&gt; (and therefore enable communication) between my-useful-stuff and
&gt; your-useful-stuff.    In many cases, though, the necessary 
&gt; abstractions to
&gt; enable communication need not be at the highly generic (thing,
&gt; philosophical-stuff) level.  Therefore, an approach that 
&gt; recognizes this and
&gt; can, within an evolutionary/automated system capture and 
&gt; exploit the natures
&gt; of:
&gt; 
&gt; - my-useful-stuff context
&gt; - your-useful-stuff context
&gt; - my-useful-stuff-and-your-useful-stuff context
&gt; 
&gt; and their inter-relationships is likely to be more fruitful (and
&gt; comprehensible to a wider user community) than 
&gt; seeking/imposing a stable
&gt; axiomatic framework for absolutely-everybody's-useful-stuff.

&gt; Dear John,
&gt; 
&gt; A word of support.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course, not.  The main reason why WordNet is more flexible than
&gt; &gt; Cyc, Sumo, Dolce, or any other axiomatized ontology is simple;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      The axioms get in the way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I have spent many years trying to improve the quality of data models
&gt; in Shell and elsewhere. By far the biggest problem has been that
&gt; data models impose constraints that simply aren't true (except in
&gt; some limited set of circumstances). As a result I have become very
&gt; conservative about constraints or axioms.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am on my way to California tomorrow, and I have a million things
&gt; &gt; to finish up before I leave.  So I'll have to wait until later,
&gt; &gt; perhaps this weekend, to send more info.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps you can explain to us how &quot;'knowledge soup' -- the
&gt; &gt; loosely organized,
&gt; &gt; &gt; semi-structured mix of whatever people have in their heads&quot;
&gt; &gt; can be canned in
&gt; &gt; &gt; FOL cans, because this is a problem that has exercised me
&gt; &gt; for way too many
&gt; &gt; &gt; years now, and though I may say &quot;I think I can&quot; till I can
&gt; &gt; not say it any
&gt; &gt; &gt; more, I just can't make myself believe that can be done any
&gt; &gt; more, not
&gt; &gt; &gt; in that &quot;direct and literal&quot; (DAL) fashion with which 
&gt; ontologicists
&gt; &gt; &gt; keep on trying to curry favor with the geists of atomists past.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course, not.  The main reason why WordNet is more flexible than
&gt; &gt; Cyc, Sumo, Dolce, or any other axiomatized ontology is simple;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      The axioms get in the way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That simple observation is heresy, which will bring down 
&gt; more threats
&gt; &gt; of excommunication than a gay bishop.   But it is a fact:  
&gt; the reason
&gt; &gt; why anybody wants axioms is to make their ontology more precise and
&gt; &gt; better adapted to whatever little niche they currently inhabit.  But
&gt; &gt; if you want an ontology that is general enough to apply to anything
&gt; &gt; and everything, you can't live with a hot-house pansy that can only
&gt; &gt; survive when every weed in sight has been extirpated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Failing that, and GOL knows any sensate person ought to
&gt; &gt; know that it's failed by now,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the only still &quot;logical&quot; alternative seems to be something
&gt; &gt; like the indirect approach,
&gt; &gt; &gt; via the explicit recognition that our models are
&gt; &gt; abductively approximate analogues of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the real thing that is ever out there, beyond us, and thus
&gt; &gt; that we have no choice but
&gt; &gt; &gt; to begin in more amorphous, proto-formal settings like sign
&gt; &gt; relations, taking serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; Peirce's notion of &quot;logic as (a specialized form of) semiotics&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My proposed solution is based on some principles that I have been
&gt; &gt; preaching for as long as anybody has been willing to listen (which
&gt; &gt; isn't very long, for most of them):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   1. You cannot build a hierarchy by drawing trees (or lattices)
&gt; &gt;      by hand -- you must have tools that can derive the hierarchy
&gt; &gt;      automatically from whatever set of distinctions are embodied
&gt; &gt;      in the ontology.  (One example of such a tool is the Toscana
&gt; &gt;      implementation(s) of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), but there
&gt; &gt;      are also other similar tools that could be used.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   2. You cannot assume that any given hierarchy is fixed for all
&gt; &gt;      time -- it is only fixed until somebody adds another axiom.
&gt; &gt;      If their axiom makes a new distinction, they will push a
&gt; &gt;      button to run the hierarchy-derivation program to redraw the
&gt; &gt;      lattice.  If you're lucky, the new axiom won't change very
&gt; &gt;      much.  But if you're unlucky, it might reorganize everything.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   3. If you need to preserve your axioms as long as anybody is
&gt; &gt;      using some application that depends on them, then you can't
&gt; &gt;      let people push buttons that will change your hierarchy just
&gt; &gt;      because they want to change theirs.  The net result is that
&gt; &gt;      the total hierarchy bifurcates, trifurcates, or multifurcates
&gt; &gt;      into incompatible contexts, modules, microtheories, or
&gt; &gt;      whatever you want to call them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   4. Meanwhile, nobody wants to learn a new language with a totally
&gt; &gt;      different vocabulary just because somebody decided to make
&gt; &gt;      a new distinction.  Therefore, they just recycle their old
&gt; &gt;      words and force the lexicographers or WordNetters to add more
&gt; &gt;      word senses or synsets.   And then you have to add more ropes
&gt; &gt;      (or pointers) to align the terminological hierarchies with
&gt; &gt;      the multipicity of axiomatized hierarchies.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And as you pointed out, Peirce recognized these problems a century
&gt; &gt; ago.  He explained, as you said, that any theory of logic is merely
&gt; &gt; a subset of the broader theory of semeiotic, which he designed to
&gt; &gt; accommodate all these ways that people and other sentient beings
