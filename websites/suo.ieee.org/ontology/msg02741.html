&gt; 
&gt; Ian -- 
&gt;    I think it is a good thing to keep these discussions as concrete
&gt; as possible, and your merged ontology, and the synopsis of 
&gt; the higfhest
&gt; levels in your note are very good contributions.
&gt;    To take up your invitation:
&gt; &gt; I invite everyone to examine these concepts . . .
&gt; 
&gt;    with regard to the suggested top several levels:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Entity
&gt; &gt;         Physical
&gt; &gt;                 Object
&gt; &gt;                 Process
&gt; &gt;         Relation
&gt; &gt;         Abstract
&gt; &gt;                 Set
&gt; &gt;                 Proposition
&gt; &gt;                 Quantity
&gt; &gt;                 Attribute
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;    I have mentioned previously that the creation of an "abstract"
&gt; category
&gt; as disjoint from "physical" at the highest level is in my view
&gt; unnecessry 
&gt; and highly undesirable, since it would preclude, for example, the
&gt; creation 
&gt; of a general concept "object" which subsumes both physical 
&gt; objects and 
&gt; abstract objects. 

I don't follow you here.  The Merged Ontology does contain a general concept
that subsumes both Physical and Abstract.  This concept is Entity.

&gt; There are other problems, such as if one wants to
&gt; define
&gt; a space or time as a set (or at least as a collection), it would be
&gt; impossible 
&gt; in the above classification to consider either as a 
&gt; "physical" concept,
&gt; even 
&gt; though space-time is as physical as my hand, as I understand current
&gt; theories
&gt; of cosmology. 

I don't agree that the high-level distinction between 'Physical' and
'Abstract' precludes the possibility of defining reasonable notions of space
and time.  In the Merged Ontology, 'TimeMeasure' is a subclass of
'Quantity', which, in turn, is a subclass of 'Abstract'.  'TimeMeasure' is
subdivided into 'TimeMeasure-Position' and 'TimeMeasure-Duration'.
'TimePoint' is a subclass of the former of these two classes, and
'TimeInterval' is a subclass of both of them - intervals have both temporal
extent and location.  It seems to be that the concept of Space could be
cashed out in a similar way, viz. as some sort of specification of abstract
measures of the physical world.   

&gt; One tactic is used by CYC, for example, 
&gt; where the concept
&gt; of
&gt; "set or collection" is at a very high level, allowing one to treat
&gt; groups of
&gt; physical objects to some extent like sets, but also allowing purely 
&gt; mathematical sets to be defined.

This concept of a set-like thing which has a position in space-time is
represented by the term 'Collection' in the Merged Ontology.  It is an
immediate subclass of 'Object'.  Note that something counts as an Object
just in case it has a position in space-time and it is relatively persistent
(I'm hoping that we'll eventually be able to cash out this notion of
persistent in a way that is acceptable to both 3D and 4D enthusiasts).

&gt;    The main motivating factor in my concern about a high-level
&gt; abstract/concrete
&gt; distinction is that this would nullify the common and very useful
&gt; process of 
&gt; creating more general ("abstract") concepts by removing spcific
&gt; attributes
&gt; or specific defining axioms from lower-level concepts.  It should be
&gt; possible
&gt; to remove the physical attributes from physical objects and 
&gt; processes to
&gt; get
&gt; more general concepts that are not physical, but are 
&gt; ancestors to the
&gt; physical concepts.

I agree wholeheartedly with you.  This was the motivation for incorporating
the function 'AbstractionFn' into the merged ontology (a function that was
suggested by some of Robert E. Kent's comments).  The utility of this
function is that it can map a class, e.g. a class of physical objects, into
an attribute that specifies all and only the properties required for
membership in the class.

&gt;    I am aware that this is not the most common view of the
&gt; abstract-concrete
&gt; distinction, and to make it more convincing I should create 
&gt; a set of at
&gt; least 100
&gt; high-level concepts showing their relations in KIF format.  I regret
&gt; that I will not
&gt; be able to do that before the August meeting.
&gt; 
&gt;    An outline of an alternative top few levels could be, just for
&gt; illustation
&gt; (concepts with a preceding ** have multiple inheritance in 
&gt; this short
&gt; classification):
&gt; 
&gt;  Entity
&gt;     Object
&gt;        Physical Object
&gt;            Ordinary Matter
&gt;                Solid Object
&gt;                    Rigid Object
&gt;                    **Powder
&gt;                Liquid Object
&gt;                Gaseous Object
&gt;                Semisolid Object

Wouldn't it make more sense to abstract the qualities of 'Solid', 'Liquid',
'Physical', 'Semisolid', and make them specifications of your category
'Physical Quality' below?

&gt;                    **Human being
&gt;            Electromagnetic Wave
&gt;            Plasma
&gt;            Condensed Matter
&gt;                Neutron Star
&gt;                Black Hole

The preceding five terms deserve a spot in the Merged Ontology.  I'll try to
find a place for them there.  Any suggestions about where they might best
fit in?

&gt;            Inanimate Object
&gt;                Artefact
&gt;        Mental Object

I'd argue for steering away from 'Mental Object', 'Idea', and 'Purpose' as
high-level reified categories.  I don't think their meaning or usefulness is
clear, and there are good reasons to think that the concept of a mental
object is just an artifact of natural language.

&gt;            Idea
&gt;                Proposition
&gt;            Purpose   
&gt;        Mathematical Object

I'd also argue against a special category of 'Mathematical Object', since
the specifications you list here (excepting Number) are applicable to a wide
variety of objects.  For example, we can create the set of world
governments, we can define functions that map nations to their governments,
etc.

&gt;            **Mathematical Set 
&gt;            **Mathematical function
&gt;            Quantifier
&gt;                Number
&gt;        Agent
&gt;            Physical Agent
&gt;                Purposive Agent

I'm not sure how 'Agent', 'Purposive Agent', and 'Cognitive Agent' differ
from one another.  

&gt;                    Microbe
&gt;                    Plant
&gt;                    Animal
&gt;                        **Mammal
&gt;                             **Human Being
&gt;                Inanimate Agent

What would be an example of an 'Inanimate Agent'?

&gt;                Cognitive agent
&gt;                    Robot
&gt;                    **Mammal
&gt;                        **Human being
&gt;     Relation
&gt;         Function
&gt;             Process
&gt;                 Physical Process
&gt;                     Mental Process
&gt;                         Communication

The subhierarchy above seems a bit confusing to me.  'Process' is a
specification of 'Function'?  'Mental Process' is a specification of
'Physical Process'?  'Communication' is a 'Mental Process'?

&gt;                 Mathematical Process
&gt;             **Mathematical function
&gt;         Semantic Relation
&gt;     Property (=attribute)
&gt;         Location
&gt;     Set or Collection
&gt;         **Mathematical Set
&gt;         Physical collection
&gt;             **Powder
&gt;         Dimension
&gt;            Physical Space Dimension
&gt;            Time
&gt;         Space
&gt;             Abstract space
&gt;             Physical space-time
&gt;     State
&gt;         Physical State
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;    Much of importance has been left out, and there are 
&gt; other concepts
&gt; in most of these categories that have been left out, this is 
&gt; just presented as an illustration of why high-level "abstract" is
&gt; unnecessarily constraining.  It is particularly a problem where
&gt; we hope that the SUO will be useful as a common basis for as many
&gt; lower-level ontologies as can fit into any one "ontological 
&gt; commitment".
&gt; The illustrative hierarchy here is not the only one that could be
&gt; created without an abstract/physical dichotomy, and many 
&gt; others might
&gt; be justs as useful or more useful.
&gt;     The justification of these choices and axiomatization 
&gt; to reflect 
&gt; the meaningful relations will require more time than I can 
&gt; provide in
&gt; the immediate future, but I believe that this classification is 
&gt; consistent and will be more useful than one with a highest-level
&gt; abstract/physical dichotomy.  I hope to be able to provide more
&gt; detailed comments on specific concepts by the time of the meeting.
