Tim,

As someone who has been trying to use the CSS2 facilities
for making HTML look pretty, I strongly agree with your point:

&gt;Your points about HTML are well made.  However, your "bottom" line borders

&gt;on being totally unconstructive criticism.  Although not the point on this

&gt;occasion, HTML is equally "useless" for pretty printing on paper and other

&gt;tasks that are all relevant to real business practice.

But as you know, HTML is based on SGML, which is based on GML,
which IBM has used for all their manuals and other business
documentation for about 30 years or so.  In 1983, I used GML
to produce the camera-ready copy for my Conceptual Structures
book. GML on the IBM mainframe in 1983 was far more adaptable
to the constraints required for high-quality publishing than
any word processor on the market today.

As a challenge test, I would ask anyone to take Chris Date's
Database book, which I used as the model for my CS book, and
try to make any word processor adapt to the formatting of
Chris Date's book with the accuracy that I achieved with GML.

But that, of course, is history.  Today, we have publishing
standards based on SGML and XML, such as DocBook:

   <A  HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/</A>

DocBook is based on an SGML DTD, which also maps to XML and
to the current HTML 4.0 and XHTML DTDs.  For publishing,
DocBook also maps to LaTeX and other output formats.

And if you want to see what DocBook produces, look at
any of the O'Reilly animal books, which are formatted
with DocBook (including, of course, the O'Reilly book
on DocBook -- which you can also download for free).

Furthermore, it's a trivial task to write simple code in
Python, Perl, or any of your favorite scripting languages
that can map any of the *ML languages from one to another.
I do that on a routine basis to map any of my 20-year-old GML
files to HTML.

The ability to do such mappings is important to me, but for
any business that hopes to stay in business for at least 10
or 20 years, it is essential.  Any employee who depends
on a company whose business plan is to make all documents
incompatible every two years should be summarily dismissed.

Bottom line:  The tools are here.  Most of them are free,
but there are also some very high-quality tools that you can
pay for, if you feel the need to spend money.

John Sowa
