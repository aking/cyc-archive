&gt; Hopefully not to muddy the water too much further,
&gt; I'd like to bring to the group's attention two
&gt; additional perspectives on situations, processes,
&gt; etc., to see if anyone has any comments about how
&gt; they relate to approaches already discussed --
&gt; perhaps they are subsumed, or considered irrelevant,
&gt; invalid, etc., though to me they each seem to have
&gt; some merit -- in any case, I'd be very interested
&gt; in anyone's insights.
&gt; 
&gt; The first is the approach presented by Robert C. Moore:
&gt; 
&gt; | We really need to say little more than
&gt; | (1) that situations are part of the causal order
&gt; | of the world rather than an abstraction of it, and
&gt; | (2) that situations are in one-to-one correspondence
&gt; | with true propositions. ... a situation is a piece of
&gt; | reality that consists of an n-tuple of entities having
&gt; | an n-ary property or relation ... a proposition is simply
&gt; | an abstraction of a situation ... a true proposition is one
&gt; | that is the abstraction of an actual situation.
&gt; | -- Robert C. Moore, "Logic and Representation",
&gt; | Moore, CSLI Publications, Stanford, p. 164-5.
&gt; 
&gt; Moore then suggests that an event should be considered as consisting
&gt; of a set of interrelated situations happening over some time period.
&gt; Thus the motion of an object from A to B over a time period consists
&gt; of a collection of situations where the object is located at different
&gt; points at different times.
&gt; 
&gt; The second perspective is presented by the linguist Bernard Comrie:
&gt; 
&gt; | ... a situation may be either a state, or an event, or a process.
&gt; | states are static, i.e. continue as before unless changed, whereas
&gt; | events and processes are dynamic, i.e. require a continual input of
&gt; | energy if they are not to come to an end; events are dynamic situations
&gt; | viewed as a complete whole (perfectively), whereas processes are dynamic
&gt; | situations viewed in progress, from within (imperfectively).
&gt; | -- Bernard Comrie (1976), "Aspect: An Introduction to the Study of
&gt; | Verbal Aspect and Related Problems", Cambridge University Press, p. 13.
&gt; 
&gt; Richard K. Harrison's website on artificial natural languages
&gt; gives a summary of Comrie's analysis of aspect and tense:
&gt; 
&gt; | In the sentence 'she was singing when I entered', the verb 'entered'
&gt; | presents its action as a single event with its beginning, middle, and
&gt; | end included;  this is an example of the perfective aspect.  The verb
&gt; | 'was singing', on the other hand, refers to an internal portion of her
&gt; | singing, without any reference to the beginning or end of her singing;
&gt; | this is an example of imperfective aspect.  In other words, the perfective
&gt; | treats a situation as a single shapeless whole, similar to the concept of
&gt; | a 'point' in geometry, while the imperfective looks at the situation from the
&gt; | inside out and admits the possibility that the situation has a temporal shape.
&gt; | 'Situation' refers to anything that can be expressed by a verb:  a 'state'
&gt; | (a static situation that will remain the same unless something changes it),
&gt; | an 'event' (a dynamic situation considered as a complete, single item) or
&gt; | a 'process' (a series of dynamic transactions viewed in progress).
&gt; | -- Richard K. Harrison, Verb Aspect,

Phil,

It would be such a joy if some of these folks would
just go visit their local campus bookstore, pick up
a math, stat, physics, engin, ops-research text and
read a few definitions of "event", "process", "state",
and so on, the sort of stuff that people have slaved
away at for umpteen generations to achieve even a bit
of clarity about, before they start cooking up their
own melanges and meringues of commonsense notions --
not that they would have to stick to the conventions,
heaven knows how gulity I am on that score! -- but
at least they would be able to provide some hint of
awareness as to why they chose their particular form
of deviance.

Just for instance:  If we want probability-&amp;-statistics-minded
people to keep talking to us, we should be aware that they use
the word "event" to refer, not to an isolated happening, which
they call an "instance", "occurrence", or "outcome", as in the
sample space &lt;Omega&gt;, but to a whole class, collection, or set
of such occurrences -- but more importantly we should be aware
of the reasons for this usage, to wit, that what is happening
is known as anything definite only insofar as it haps to find
itself depicted, and it is only in the most ideally fictional
case that its depiction contains enough information to pin it
down to the "individual" instance, the "isolated" occurrence,
or the "point" outcome.

I have been assured once or twice already
that everybody understands this already.
Alright already.  Still, I wonder.

Jon Awbrey
