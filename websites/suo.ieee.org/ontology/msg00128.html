&gt; 
&gt; SUO, S.A., FOO,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to address some of the unities that are manifested
&gt; among the concepts of information, inquiry, logic, and signs,
&gt; along with the brands of theoretical integration that are
&gt; possible among their respective efforts of theory,
&gt; that is to say, at least, their up-until-now
&gt; largely several and mostly separate efforts
&gt; toward any sort of an adequate theory.
&gt; 
&gt; "Hello there, Some Of The Unities ..."
&gt; &lt; Art Carney or Jackie Gleason voice,
&gt; | I cannot remember which right now &gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I am trying to make this address positive, that is to say,
&gt; in the sense of addressing the conventionally-called "positive"
&gt; side of each concept in the list, but just in case the bearing
&gt; on some of our previous discussions is not clear, I probably ought
&gt; to mention that this address also addresses, albeit in an indirect way,
&gt; the disintegrities that we have noticed among our concepts, our terms,
&gt; and our "rough and ready" but a bit "faute de mieux" theories, such as
&gt; they are, of ambiguity, discrepancy, disparity, divergence, diversity,
&gt; ellipticity, enthymemacity, equivocality, fuzziness, generality, hyperbole,
&gt; indefiniteness, indefinity, indeterminacy, metaphor, mutagenicity, parabole,
&gt; uncertainty, vagueness, and all the rest of their vast and very unruly clan.

I forgot to mention digression, dispersion, dissipation, ...

When it comes to the Topic of Logic, I will revert to my customary practice
of beginning at the bottom and trying to work up, that is, of starting with
the humble preliminaries of propositional calculus, whose name is legion --
"If you can't make it there, you can't make it anywhere" -- and rather than
following Frege's model-theoretic practice of saying that Truth and Falsity
are objects that may be denoted by propositional signs under a contemplated
choice of interpretation -- at least, that is how I remember it from many
years back, but I am just about to make my periodic review of the sources
on this question, any day now -- I will follow what I take to be the more
preferable practice of saying that a propositional sign denotes a certain
form of matter, a pattern of content, a realization of potential, in short,
a function of the type f : B^k -&gt; B, for suitable k and where B = {0, 1},
the latter interpreted as logical values:  0 = F = Falsity, 1 = T = Truth.

In order to make the connection between Logic and Information,
I observe that the function that a propositional sign denotes is
just the "square-wave" or the "step-function" approximation to the
sorts of "frequency distributions" or "probability densities" that
we find so basic to our present-day "Theory Of Information" (TOI).

Here is a sufficient example to convey the basic picture:

For the proposition AB, that is, A&amp;B, we have
AB depicted as a function of type f : B^2 -&gt; B,
and AB illustrated by means of a venn diagram:

   1 ^      o--o
     |      |%%|
     |      |%%|
   0 o------o  o------&gt;

    AB = 10, 11, 01, 00

     o----------------o
     |     /\  /\     |
     |    /  \/  \    |
     |   /   /\   \   |
     |  / A /%%\ B \  |
     |  \   \%%/   /  |
     |   \   \/   /   |
     |    \  /\  /    |
     |     \/  \/     |
     o----------------o

It is my belief, and unless the most of you already agree
it will become my task to argue later on, that a complete
understanding of information theory obviates the need for
any further "theory of fuzziness" (TOF), that is, for all
practical purposes, anyway.  Of course, in asserting this,
I am anticipating my usage of Peirce's qualitative version
of TOI, which he derived from purely logical considerations,
in effect, from his earliest ideas about the theory of signs,
long before he came to devise a logarithmic measure for the
quantitative analysis of information content.  And you can
look it up!

To Be Continued,

Jon Awbrey
