Dear John, Pat  and Matthew .

Suppose your discussion  around  the  4D  approach is not too principle .
The both approaches can coexist "in peace" if  implemented to principle different types of
objects . Some examples . When working  with Oracle HR we use their "date tracked" objects .
Such  for example personID is not  unique and primary key for it is  PersonID+DateFrom+DateTo .
There are no problems with history  description for date tracked objects  with different
properties in different periods of time and there are no problems  to identify
the same person .  The like situation  is with the "fixed essets" objects.  But the situation
is much more complex  with the  "nonmaterial essets" - software for example .
Such it is a hard work to support a consistency between different  versions
and  the "patches" inside) in DBMS, development tools ,  an application software etc.
Suppose it is a challenge for IT community. For such types of objects may be it will
be more suitable to use  the 4D approach . From the biosemiotic point of view  -
<A  HREF="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/txt/biosem.html">http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/txt/biosem.html</A>   such difference is natural
because of the two types of  objects  belong  to "macro level"  and  to "micro level" .

JFS&gt; Matthew and Pat,

JFS&gt; I believe that you have both made some very important points.
JFS&gt; Rather than criticizing the ideas I don't fully agree with,
JFS&gt; I will comment on some that I like very much.

JFS&gt; Then I'll present my preferred way of viewing things, which
JFS&gt; allows for multiple viewpoints to coexist (even when they
JFS&gt; couldn't be simultaneously asserted without contradiction).

&gt;&gt;MW: It is my experience that indeed the things people argue about the most

&gt;&gt;are at the highest levels, where as the day to day things people find easier

&gt;&gt;to agree on, because we can point at things to see whether we mean the same

&gt;&gt;thing or not. So for example, I doubt if any difficulty we might have on
&gt;&gt;agreeing what we meant by "red" would have anything to do with whether we
&gt;&gt;saw it as a property, that things could take up, or as a class whose members

&gt;&gt;were states, either individuals, or temporal parts of individuals. I would

&gt;&gt;expect the discussion to be around where the border was between red and
&gt;&gt;other adjacent colours. So "red" can fit into different frameworks with
&gt;&gt;different ways of understanding what being red means.

JFS&gt; This is a very clear statement of a position, which I agree
JFS&gt; with, but which is more often expressed in a more muddled way,
JFS&gt; which I don't agree with.  The simpler, more muddled, and
JFS&gt; to my mind, more dangerous way is the following:

JFS&gt;     It is easier for people to agree on the lower-level
JFS&gt;     concepts than on the higher-level ones.  Therefore,
JFS&gt;     the high-level concepts aren't important, and it doesn't
JFS&gt;     matter if we haven't done a good job on the top levels.

JFS&gt; The point where I stop agreeing in such an enthusiastic way
JFS&gt; is at the next sentence:

&gt;&gt;MW: I would further expect
&gt;&gt;to be able to translate between the different frameworks.

JFS&gt; Pat has stated my concerns very nicely:

&gt;&gt;PH: Obviously the interesting case is where they are referring to
&gt;&gt;different concepts. But the difficult case is where A's concept
&gt;&gt;cannot even be expressed in B's overall ontological framework, and
&gt;&gt;vice versa.

JFS&gt; I also like Pat's succinct summary of an important distinction,
JFS&gt; which I use as one of the top three in my top-level ontology:

&gt;&gt;PH: In the
&gt;&gt;continuant/occurent way of thinking, one refers to existence *at a
&gt;&gt;time*. This means that the four-dimensional entities simply do not
&gt;&gt;exist in this ontology. A continuant is something which continues to
&gt;&gt;exist through time and retains its identity through time, and is such
&gt;&gt;that (this is the characterising property) all its parts are present
&gt;&gt;whenever it is present. Thus a person is a continuant, since if I am
&gt;&gt;here then all my parts are here (now), while a race, say, is not a
&gt;&gt;continuant - it is in fact an occurrent - since it has parts which
&gt;&gt;are temporally distinguished: it has a beginning, a middle and an
&gt;&gt;end. The distinction is like that between a person (a continuant) and
&gt;&gt;that person's life (an occurrent).

JFS&gt; And this is a good summary of the problem:

&gt;&gt;PH: Both occurrents and continuants 'map' into 4-d entities in the 4-d
&gt;&gt;histories ontology, but there is no principled way there to
&gt;&gt;distinguish them. The nearest you can get is to say that continuants
&gt;&gt;have isotemporal parts while occurents have isospatial parts, but in
&gt;&gt;the 4-d histories ontology one can cut 'parts' any way one chooses,
&gt;&gt;including along boundaries which slant in time (ie which are
&gt;&gt;'moving', as someone who thinks non-4-dimensionally would say.) And
&gt;&gt;the defining criteria for the distinction in the other ontology is
&gt;&gt;literally incoherent in the 4-d ontology, since *nothing* is such
&gt;&gt;that all its parts are present whenever it is present: the 'whenever'
&gt;&gt;here is meaningless in the 4d ontology.

&gt;&gt;As evidence for the idea of a continuant in intuitive thinking,
&gt;&gt;consider the claim that I am the same person I was 10 years ago. This
&gt;&gt;is literally false in the 4-d ontology (it can be expressed there by
&gt;&gt;saying that me-now and me-1990 are both slices of the me-history, but
&gt;&gt;that raises the question of what distinguishes one history from
&gt;&gt;another, since these are also both slices of completely unrelated
&gt;&gt;histories) Statements like this seem to depend on the idea of
&gt;&gt;something retaining its identity through time, even though its
&gt;&gt;properties may change. This 'locus of identity' is what constitutes
&gt;&gt;the basic idea of a continuant, I think.

JFS&gt; To summarize:

JFS&gt;  1. Pat says that the 4-D viewpoint allows ways of cutting up
JFS&gt;     the universe that cannot be mapped into the viewpoint of
JFS&gt;     3-D plus time.

JFS&gt;  2. Matthew points out that it is easier to map the 3-D plus
JFS&gt;     time viewpoint into the 4-D viewpoint.

JFS&gt; I agree with both, but only with the caveat that "easier" does
JFS&gt; not imply "possible to translate each and every distinction
JFS&gt; that anyone would ever want to make."

&gt;&gt;&gt;MW: Until recently I used as my baseline a viewpoint that said that there

&gt;&gt;&gt;were individual things like you, my car, classes, and associations, where
JFS&gt; an
&gt;&gt;&gt;association is a relationship that understands that it lasts for a period
JFS&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;time. I have moved to a 4D approach, replacing individual things with
&gt;&gt;&gt;spatio-temporal extents, and associations with timeless relations. However,

&gt;&gt;&gt;I know very well how to take something from my old model and represent it
JFS&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt;the new model, and vice-versa.

JFS&gt; But Pat points out the problem some distinctions vanish in
JFS&gt; the 4-D ontology, and I agree:

&gt;&gt;I wonder if you really can do this, if you think hard about it. Ive
&gt;&gt;been living within a 4-d ontology for a long time and mapping other
&gt;&gt;ontologies to it, and what I find is that many distinctions simply
&gt;&gt;vanish, rather than being 'translated'. This is fine with me, of
&gt;&gt;course, but it tends to get the other folk a little upset, especially
&gt;&gt;when they have written entire books about these distinctions. And in
&gt;&gt;the other direction, I find that perfectly reasonable-seeming things
&gt;&gt;in my ontology, like 'moving' (sloping in space/time) boundaries,
&gt;&gt;simply cannot be admitted into the other ontologies without producing
&gt;&gt;unacceptable confusions.

JFS&gt; I also agree very strongly with the following:

&gt;&gt;PH: I think that what seems to me to be overoptimism about the
&gt;&gt; prospects of the SUO among some folk might arise from their failure
&gt;&gt; to appreciate that such incompatible conceptualizations can even
&gt;&gt; exist, let alone all have their uses.

JFS&gt; I agree with Matthew's last sentence, but not the first one:

&gt;&gt;MW: I have a simple attitude towards incompatible conceptualisations: they

&gt;&gt;mean we do not understand the world around us. The world around us is not
&gt;&gt;incompatible with itself.

JFS&gt; There may be very good reasons for using incompatible
JFS&gt; representations even when a single unified one is understood,
JFS&gt; as Pat explained with his example of quantum electrodynamics.
JFS&gt; I also believe that there are a very large number of other
JFS&gt; examples that one could use, as I tried to explain in the
JFS&gt; Knowledge Soup chapter of my KR book.

JFS&gt; Although I agree with a great deal of what Pat says,
JFS&gt; I would quibble with the following:

&gt;&gt;PH: the
&gt;&gt;world around us IS incompatible with itself, in that we have to use
&gt;&gt;two incompatible ways of conceptualizing it in order to fully
&gt;&gt;describe it.  There is no single underlying theory of the world, and
&gt;&gt;some of the best minds who have thought about the matter during the
&gt;&gt;last century have concluded that there is no way to produce one.

JFS&gt; On the contrary, quantum electrodynamics is a single coherent
JFS&gt; conceptualization, and it is possible (at least in principle)
JFS&gt; to use it to solve problems without breaking it apart in
JFS&gt; incompatible ways.  Unfortunately, for most practical
JFS&gt; problems, QED is so computationally difficult that
JFS&gt; different (and incompatible) simplifications are necessary
JFS&gt; to get useful results in an acceptable amount of time.

JFS&gt; I strongly agree with Pat's point:

&gt;&gt;PH: I think that you believe that there is a single, universally
&gt;&gt;acceptable, ontology, and that all others can be mapped into it. I
&gt;&gt;think this will happen only when science stops.

JFS&gt; But I still believe that there is something useful that we can
JFS&gt; accomplish even before science stops.  My best cut at what
JFS&gt; that may be is summarized in the Knowledge Soup chapter of
JFS&gt; my KR book.  Summarizing even more briefly,

JFS&gt;  1. An open-ended lattice of theories, which could be extended
JFS&gt;     arbitrarily far to accommodate any possible way of
JFS&gt;     conceptualizing the world in any finite set of concepts.
JFS&gt;     A complete lattice would have to be infinite, but any
JFS&gt;     particular version that might be implemented at any one
JFS&gt;     time is finite.  However, there is no restriction on what
JFS&gt;     anyone might add to it, given enough time, effort, and
JFS&gt;     ingenuity.

JFS&gt;  2. Methods for navigating the lattice to find theories that
JFS&gt;     are approximately true or "good enough" for many problems,
JFS&gt;     and with methods for revising and extending theories to
JFS&gt;     make them better adapted to solving new problems.

JFS&gt; For more about the lattice of theories, see Section 6 of my
JFS&gt; paper on processes and causality:

JFS&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm</A>

JFS&gt; And by the way, I believe that causality is a very important
JFS&gt; concept that is central to a large number of issues in the SUO.
JFS&gt; But that is another topic.

JFS&gt; John Sowa
