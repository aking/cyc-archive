Bernard --
  Thanks for the clarification.  I will just comment here on
one point you raised:

&gt; But why do we need such a concept than "generic defining characteristics of
&gt; a physical object"?
&gt; 
  I think that, in building an SUO, it is a good idea to include all the
meaningful higher-level concepts that one can, because it helps 
in maintaining a complex ontology to have each meaningful distinction 
defined at one high-level point rather than at multiple lower-level
points.  Also, I think it helps to fully grasp what 
the concepts mean (for me, anyway); and in the event that someone 
in the future wanted to create and use some high-level concept 
that is not already in the SUO, it is likely to be more 
troublesome at that time than to have it defined at the earliest 
point in the process.  We needn't rack our brains to think of
all possibiities, or to automatically create all possible concepts,
but where one seems natural, I think we would need to have 
a specific reason not to include it.  A high-level 
"physical object" otherwise unspecified is one that is very common 
in ontologies, and we should try to define it in a way that is most 
useful and most easily understood by all users.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to step in that debate. I think we mixed two questions there. One is
&gt; about the definition of physical objects.
&gt; The other is about the "Quantity" categories. I had the latter in mind, but
&gt; maybe I was not clear enough about it and misleaded you to address the
&gt; former. I try to clarify below.
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt; &gt; Regarding the minimal attributes of a physical object:
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; In the merged ontology, "physical" is defined (in the gloss) as an
&gt; entity
&gt; &gt; &gt; that has location in space-time &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Space and time are not the only (physical) measurable, and other
&gt; attributes
&gt; &gt; &gt; (mass, energy, temperature, wavelength) . . .
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt; &gt;   First, note that "physical" subsumes processes, not just physical
&gt; &gt; objects.  The following comments are relevant to Bernard Vatant's
&gt; &gt; remarks, interpreted as applying to physical objects (as I believe he
&gt; &gt; intended).
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; My intent was not to focus debate on definition of minimal attributes for a
&gt; physical object, but on the classification of attributes, and mainly what
&gt; lives under Quantity, and particularly to know if Space and Time were to be
&gt; considered as subcategories of a more generic category Measurable Quantity.
&gt; But if pushed on that ground, I would tend to consider in whatever physical
&gt; (object or process) no more than a set of measurable. Of course this is a
&gt; very restrictive (reductionist) ontology, but should satisfy a wide scope of
&gt; technical or science fields.
&gt; I'm sort of agnostic concerning the ontological status of "physical" anyway,
&gt; because there are too many entities, for example in the technologies field,
&gt; which I can't really classify under Physical nor Abstract. Is the software
&gt; I'm using right now to write this mail a physical object? a physical
&gt; process? an abstract object? I can make measures on it, like the number of
&gt; bytes it's taking on my HD, but when thinking about it, I just can't figure
&gt; ... And what about virtual objects, to which I can assign values for
&gt; "virtual physical attributes" (?) e.g. Lara Croft's (virtual) we
&gt; ight and
&gt; size or max speed of Star Wars X-Wing? And we'll have more and more of those
&gt; around ... the ontology of virtual reality is here to stay and will not
&gt; simplify our task ...
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt; &gt;   In my own ontology I use mass as the defining characteristic of a
&gt; "physicalobject", but location in space-time is also legitimate, provided
&gt; that one uses "location" in the broad sense, meaning any one or more of a
&gt; point, region, or, if one is concerned with subatomic distances or
&gt; interference pattterns, statistical distribution through space (wave
&gt; function).
&gt; &gt;  "energy" is equivalent to mass, unless one wants to use "rest mass",
&gt; &gt; which would, however, eliminate electromagnetic waves as physical --
&gt; &gt; I prefer "relativistic mass".
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; All that makes sense. But IMO defining a physical object out of one single
&gt; measurable leads to some examples very difficult to handle. Take any
&gt; arbitrary "empty" (in the usual sense of the term) small volume of
&gt; intergalactic space-time "containing only" diffuse galactic light and
&gt; cosmological background and whatever hypothetical non-hadronic "dark matter"
&gt; lurking there. Will you call that portion an "object"?. It has a mass-energy
&gt; content, right, but many people will be very reluctant to call it an
&gt; "object" ...
&gt; But it is "physical" anyway, in the sense you can define measurable
&gt; attributes for it, like position and mass-energy density.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; &gt; . . . are other measurable necessary to
&gt; &gt; &gt; define physical entities, . . .
&gt; &gt; &gt; . . . and I wonder
&gt; &gt; &gt; why these other attributes are not considered at the same level, along
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; space and time, under a generic "measurable attribute".
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt; &gt;    No, temperature and wavelength are relevant only for certain types of
&gt; &gt; physical objects; ordinary temperature is a statistical property of
&gt; &gt; large numbers of particles.  If you are thinking of the DeBroglie
&gt; &gt; wavelength, that is derivable from the mass.  Extended non-standard
&gt; &gt; definitions of those quantities might be attributed to many objects,
&gt; &gt; but that should not be forced on users.  That can be done at a lower
&gt; &gt; level.  The most general "physical object" can not have all measurable
&gt; &gt; attributes, only those common to all "physical objects".
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; I do not pretend that the attributes were interchangeable as characteristics
&gt; of the "physical" nature.
&gt; What I am up to, again, is not the classification of objects, but the
&gt; classification of quantities.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; and many entities have no specific space-time
&gt; &gt; &gt; location (not to mention that quantum mechanics has somehow seriously
&gt; shaken
&gt; &gt; &gt; the notion of space-time location as making any sense at all),
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt; &gt;    I think it's best to
&gt;  keep the definitions in the SUO within the
&gt; &gt; realms of
&gt; &gt; common sense to the extent that they can be while still providing
&gt; &gt; consistency with modern physics.  If you really think that "location"
&gt; &gt; makes no sense at all, it would seem rather difficult or impossible to
&gt; &gt; create any ontology that is useful for practical purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; Of course. We are about practical applications hence approximations. I'm
&gt; glad to read that. I pointed the quantum mechanics "view of the world"
&gt; exactly to show that the ontology we use at any level are approximations.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So it seems that Measurable is more generic than space and time.
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt; &gt;    "measurable" is an attribute of certain properties that matter may
&gt; &gt; or may not possess, and you would need a careful definition to make that
&gt; &gt; notion precise as a defining characteristic of material objects.
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; Is not all knowledge all about being careful ? ;o)
&gt; Even if we don't export QM concepts all over the place, there is at least an
&gt; ontological one in the deepest sense of the term. Having a "measura
&gt; ble"
&gt; means than you can conduct a measure experiment and get quantitative
&gt; results. It does not mean that out there exists some matter or physical
&gt; object having "properties with measurable attribute(s)". Or in any case any
&gt; other aspect - including existence - than these measures are often
&gt; irrelevant. The measure is hence the more fundamental concept, and the
&gt; notion of physical object is derived from the measure process if ever we
&gt; need it, and this is not always the case. And this is very pragmatic. When
&gt; measuring the value of a temperature or a magnetic field intensity or a
&gt; pression or a star position, one is generally most interested by these
&gt; values themselves and does not care about whatever object of which they are
&gt; attributes.
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt;   &gt; Is some object many trillions of light-years away in an inflationary
&gt; &gt; universe, and moving away at near light-speed "measurable"?  by whom?
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; If it's not measurable, it's not physical IMO. Measures maybe very
&gt; inaccurate in this case - trillions of LY seems very far indeed in our
&gt; universe! But: either you get information, which means you have made an
&gt; observation (data acquisition) and measured quantities, either you have no
&gt; measurable, and the problem is that you "imagine an object" before any
&gt; measure was done and declare its physical existence. Is it more physical
&gt; than Lara Croft? :o)
&gt; 
&gt; But cosmological examples arise quite interesting questions anyway. For
&gt; example stars have been defined for centuries as set of measurements
&gt; (positions in the sky) before the question of physical objects behind those
&gt; measurements was even asked. The nature of stars as physical objects was
&gt; clearly rebuilt out of sets of measurable (mainly spectrum). We had more
&gt; recently the same ex
&gt; perience with quasars and gravitational mirages and
&gt; other weird deep-sky "objects". And we have the "dark matter" which has only
&gt; for the moment only theoretical existence and not the least set of
&gt; measurable about it. Where do you put it? Physical or Abstract? (90% or such
&gt; of our universe mass if it "exists" ... difficult to call that an
&gt; abstraction)
&gt; 
&gt; [PC]
&gt; &gt;    If mass alone, or mass plus location are inadequate as generic
&gt; &gt; defining characteristics of a "physical object", it would be helpful
&gt; &gt; if someone could find a counterexample either
&gt; &gt; (1) of a physical object that doesn't have those characteristics,
&gt; &gt;  or (2) a non-physical object that does.
&gt; 
&gt; [BV]
&gt; But why do we need such a concept than "genering defining characteristics of
&gt; a physical object"?
