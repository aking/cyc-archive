I will try to get a little bit further along

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This posting follows up on four recent postings to the SUO

&gt; &gt; the nature of modeling, and the roles of syntax and semantics
&gt; &gt; in first-order logic. These four postings are:

&gt; &gt; (November 29, 2000; John Sowa),
&gt; &gt; which discusses supervaluation and which refers to a figure at
&gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A>. This figure
&gt; &gt; depicts relationships among World, Model, and Theory.

&gt; &gt; 4 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02449.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02449.html</A>
&gt; &gt; (December 1, 2000; Robert Kent),
&gt; &gt; which supplies a PDF file describing "various syntactic and semantic
&gt; &gt; components of 1st order logic."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In posting 1, John Sowa considers the topic "foundations of ontology"
&gt; &gt; to be:  "a critical examination of the principles for
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     (1) analyzing a subject domain,
&gt; &gt;     (2) identifying and classifying critical aspects, and
&gt; &gt;     (3) specifying them in a way that some formalization
&gt; &gt;         in a language such as KIF would be possible."
&gt; 
&gt; I went back and read John's note again in the light of your remarks.
&gt; The business of identifying assumptions and distinctions is a very
&gt; important step for me.  I often find myself describing it under the
&gt; three rubrics of "articulation", "reflection", and "relativization".
&gt; By this I mean the kind of reflection on our autonomous experience
&gt; and automatic conduct that allows us to articulate and express in
&gt; explicit signs the sorts of beliefs which we just a moment before
&gt; were taking for granted, perhaps never before even conscious of
&gt; them, and thus to re-express formerly absolute beliefs as being
&gt; contingent or relative beliefs.  This reminds me of what we do
&gt; in logic when we shift from "A |- B" to "|- A =&gt; B", that is,
&gt; if you consider the statements before the turnstile as being
&gt; analogous in a way to unexamined or taken for granted ideas.
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment when I start to reflect, I usually find that
&gt; I have been engaged in some stream of unthinking conduct,
&gt; and what it is that ripples this stream and causes me to
&gt; reflect is almost always one of two types of alteration,
&gt; change, difference, dissatisfaction, disturbance, jolt,
&gt; shift, shock, or strife that occurs within my experience.
&gt; Notice that all of these things have in common the aspect
&gt; or the idea of a "difference", and it is only here that we
&gt; pass from a sense of all-pervading confluence in experience
&gt; to a sense of boundaries, definitions, domains, and limits.
&gt; 
&gt; But I said that I could see these experiences of difference
&gt; falling mainly into a couple of types.  There is what I call
&gt; a "surprising phenomenon", which involves a difference between
&gt; what one expects and what one observes.  There is what I call
&gt; a "problematic situation", which involves a difference between
&gt; what one intends and what one observes.  Each of these serves
&gt; as a spur to a different sort of action.
&gt; 
&gt; A surprising phenomenon leads to a search for the sort
&gt; of theoretical statement that will serve as an explanation
&gt; for the phenomenon, thereby decreasing the disparity between
&gt; the actual and the expected events and reducing the affective
&gt; sense of surprise that accompanies the phenomenon.
&gt; 
&gt; A problematic situation leads to a search for the sort
&gt; of practical policy that will serve a plan of action
&gt; for resolving the problem, by bringing the actual
&gt; and the desired states back into accord.
&gt; 
&gt; These are the themes that come to mind when I think
&gt; of the nature, the occasion, and the springs of the
&gt; kind of reflection that is needed to fund a critical
&gt; examination of the automatic assumptions, the basic
&gt; beliefs, the concepts, and the distinctions in our
&gt; experience that constitute what we commonly call
&gt; a "domain".
&gt; 
&gt; That's (1).  But now I must break for today.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for throwing some interesting lights on this subject.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey

&gt; 
&gt; Remainder of original note follows:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would like to sketch out some thoughts as fodder for discussion.
&gt; &gt; These thoughts are preliminary, informal, and perhaps naive;
&gt; &gt; I welcome suggestions that would help my meaning along.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What I am trying to do is understand some details of
&gt; &gt; the three steps as outlined by John, and to suggest
&gt; &gt; that certain ideas from postings 2-4 should also
&gt; &gt; perhaps be part of such a critical examination.
&gt; &gt; Kind comments are most welcome.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A. Analyzing a subject domain.

Okay, when you say "subject domain" I am probably going to be
thinking "phenomenon" or "problem" in the field of experience.
And when you say "analysis" I am probably going to be reminded
that our first address, analysis, approach, approximation, and
articulation of a phenomenon or a problem is likely to do very
little toward clearing up the muddle in which we find ourselves,
but merely to transpose it into the key, the register, the scale,
and the time signature of a discrete verbal notation.

I have a picture like this:

   P1
   ^
   |    P2
   |    ^
   .    |    P3
   S1   |    ^
        .    |
        S2   |
             .
             S3

Here, the Sj are Subjects and the Pj are Predicates,
as in some rudimentary syllogistic scheme, only there
are lots more of them and lots more criss-crossing lines
of implication that run between them, in technical terms,
thoroughly "muddling up the scene".

These are just the facts, man, but their observation
in such a raw condition hardly does much to help the
interloper get down to the brassier taxa of clarity.

What next?  Well, consider the following generic element of structure:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

          Z                     
          •
          |\
          | \
          |  \
          |   \
          |    \  Rule
          |     \
          |      \
          | A   &gt; \
          |  \ /   \
    Fact  | &lt;-¤-D   • Y
          |  / \   /
          | I   &gt; /
          |      /
          |     /
          |    /  Case
          |   /
          |  /
          | /
          |/
          •
          X

Figure 1.  Basic Structure &amp; Terminology

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Legend 1.

Deduction takes a Case, the minor premiss of the form X =&gt; Y,
matches it with a Rule, the major premiss of the form Y =&gt; Z,
then adverts to a Fact, the bound outcome of the form X =&gt; Z.

Induction takes a Case of the form X =&gt; Y,
matches it with a Fact of the form X =&gt; Z,
then adverts to a Rule of the form Y =&gt; Z.

Abduction takes a Fact of the form X =&gt; Z,
matches it with a Rule of the form Y =&gt; Z,
then adverts to a Case of the form X =&gt; Y.

Even more succinctly:

           Abduction  Deduction  Induction

Premiss:     Fact       Rule       Case
Premiss:     Rule       Case       Fact
Outcome:     Case       Fact       Rule

<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00676.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00676.html</A>

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The gist of all of this syllogistic in-formation lies in the lesson that,
before one can even think about doing any order of demonstrative reasoning,
in other words, deduction, one must first have primed the pump with a modicum
of middle terms that will serve to fund the reasoning process in the interval
encompassed by that all too apophantom gape that lies beteen the predicates
and the subjects that are given to us by the "data of the senses" (DOTS).

The business of looking at a mess of P's and S's as given by the DOTS,
and trying to find the right source of M's that can serve as a medium
to ameliorate the muddle of the situation, all of that is what comes
to mind under the heading of "analysis" for me.

Once you do come to have a rich enough channel, source, or vein of middle terms,
that are fit to mediate the right explanations for a whole panorama of phenomena,
that are fit to negotiate the right plans of action for a whole panoply of problems,
then the business of analysis becomes an almost mundane affair, a routine matter of
dealing with the facts as they occur by way of the proto-type of non-demonstrative
reasoning that is called "abductive" and by way of the post-type of non-demonstrative
reasoning that is called "inductive" by the garden variety of pragmatic nomenclators.

To make this long story as short as I can, the type of analysis of facts, like S=&gt;P,
of the sort that serves to fund all future Ab-/De-/In-Ductions, shapes up like this:

          P
          •
          |\
          | \
          |  \
          |   \
          |    \  Rule
          |     \
          |      \
          |       \
          |        \
    Fact  | -----&gt;  • M
          |        /
          |       /
          |      /
          |     /
          |    /  Case
          |   /
          |  /
          | /
          |/
          •
          S

That's as far as I can get for now.

Cheers,

Jon Awbrey

Remainder of original note follows:

&gt; &gt;    1) In considering a subject domain, do we need to consider the
&gt; &gt;       scope of the domain?  If so, how do we delimit the scope?
&gt; &gt;       How will we agree on the boundary of our inquiry?
&gt; &gt;       Is it appropriate, or perhaps even necessary given our language,
&gt; &gt;       that we tend to think in spatial metaphors when we consider
&gt; &gt;       the things represented by words such as "domain," "scope,"
&gt; &gt;       "delimit", "boundary"?  If it is appropriate or necessary
&gt; &gt;       to use such metaphoric language in describing our subject
&gt; &gt;       domain, are there significant consequences of this?  Are there
&gt; &gt;       identifiable limitations of spatially-based descriptions that
&gt; &gt;       constrain how we are able to describe our domain?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       And do such limitations of spatially-based language reach even
&gt; &gt;       further and constrain not just the ways we can describe our
&gt; &gt;       subject domain, but even the ways we can conceptualize our world
&gt; &gt;       - that is, our ontologies?  If so, would the fact of this constraint
&gt; &gt;       (the limitations of our own mental apparatus, especially as regards
&gt; &gt;       the use of spatial language to describe "nonspatial" things) be
&gt; &gt;       be a "critical aspect" of the foundations of ontology that
&gt; &gt;       we need to take into account?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    2) In considering any given subject domain, will we also need
&gt; &gt;       to consider where this subject domains trails off into other
&gt; &gt;       subject domains that are somehow "similar", "related" or "near by"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       I am thinking here of the "context" of our subject domain.  We might
&gt; &gt;       describe this context as that which in some sense lies "outside"
&gt; &gt;       of the domain of inquiry, but which elucidates both the relationships
&gt; &gt;       within that domain and the manner in which this domain "sits in"
&gt; &gt;       its ambience.  This notion of context might also be viewed as
&gt; &gt;       "that which lies outside of, but is still related to our domain of
&gt; &gt;       interest" (related in the sense that it allows us to see connections
&gt; &gt;       that exist within our domain and connections that exist between what
&gt; &gt;       is in our domain and what is outside of it)."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       Again, are there consequences to using spatial language to
&gt; &gt;       describe and delimit our domain of inquiry?  And if there
&gt; &gt;       are consequences, what is their import for the foundations of
&gt; &gt;       ontology?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    3) The language used to describe to describe this notion of context,
&gt; &gt;       as well as the language used to describe and delimit our domain
&gt; &gt;       of inquiry - do these kinds of language use relate to the different
&gt; &gt;       kinds of language use that John described in posting 2?
&gt; &gt;       In that posting John said that some words are used to talk about
&gt; &gt;       syntax, others are used to talk about semantics, and others are
&gt; &gt;       used to "talk about the world itself, which we are trying to model..."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       On the surface, it seems that the language used to describe
&gt; &gt;       both the delimiting of our domain and the context of the domain
&gt; &gt;       is of this last kind.  But I wonder.  It seems that there may be
&gt; &gt;       some worthwhile distinctions to be made here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       For instance, is there a relationship between the symbols and words
&gt; &gt;       used to describe a "syntax" and the words used to describe a given
&gt; &gt;       subject domain, in the sense that both a syntax and a subject domain
&gt; &gt;       can be understood in certain important ways "independently," without
&gt; &gt;       appeals to a broader, embedding context?  And is there a relationship
&gt; &gt;       between the metalanguage used to describe syntax and the language
&gt; &gt;       that describes the context of our domain, in the sense that both are
&gt; &gt;       designed to be "bridge-crossing" uses of language that allow us to
&gt; &gt;       broaden our understanding by explaining the connections that exist
&gt; &gt;       between the narrowly defined worlds and the "contexts" in which they
&gt; &gt;       sit?  If there are such relationships, are they merely curiosities,
&gt; &gt;       or do they have some import for the foundations of ontology?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; B. Critical aspects
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     1) Pick your definition of ontology.  Let's say this definition
&gt; &gt;        corresponds, roughly, to "a way of conceptualizing the world."
&gt; &gt;        If this can be granted, then shouldn't the foundations of ontology
&gt; &gt;        be concerned with the different _ways_ in which this
&gt; &gt;        conceptualizing can be (or is) done, as well as possible
&gt; &gt;        relationships among, and implications of, these different ways
&gt; &gt;        of conceptualizing? John, is this what you mean by "identifying and
&gt; &gt;        classifying critical aspects"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        For instance, one way that people understand their world might be to
&gt; &gt;        "conceptualize the world by considering things to exist in
&gt; &gt;        hierarchical relationships with each other." Another way might
&gt; &gt;        be "conceptualizing the world by grouping somehow like things into
&gt; &gt;        categories" (where I may leave unstated for now the possible
&gt; &gt;        dependence of hierarchies upon categorization). And another way
&gt; &gt;        might be "conceptualizing at least certain parts of the world
&gt; &gt;        by considering some sort of order relation (temporal, spatial,
&gt; &gt;        linguistic) to hold among certain pieces of the world."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        Or, more broadly speaking, people can think of the world as
&gt; &gt;        "things and relationships between things", or "things and
&gt; &gt;        operations on things", or "everything is process", or "things and
&gt; &gt;        their changes through time." And people may then invoke
&gt; &gt;        similarly broad ways of describing these conceptualizations,
&gt; &gt;        by considering common and generally accepted ways of describing
&gt; &gt;        structures and operations (e.g., sets and functions, or objects
&gt; &gt;        and morphisms).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;        John, in your view, do such different ways of viewing the world
&gt; &gt;        appropriately fall into what you call "critical aspects"?  Why
&gt; &gt;        or why not?  What might be other critical aspects that should be
&gt; &gt;        identified and classified?  Identification and classification
&gt; &gt;        themselves, for instance?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; C. Specifying [critical aspects?] so that some formalization is possible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       Here I'd like to refer to the notions of "Model", "World", and
&gt; &gt;       "Theory" from the figure that John Sowa mentioned in posting 3,
&gt; &gt;       as well as the table given by Robert Kent in posting 4, which has
&gt; &gt;       two columns: one for "LOGIC (SYNTAX)" and another for
&gt; &gt;       "MODEL THEORY (SEMANTICS)".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       1. What are the different ways in which a Model can be an
&gt; &gt;       approximation of the World?  And what criteria can
&gt; &gt;       be used to judge the "adequacy" (good, fair, poor) of the
&gt; &gt;       approximation for a given set of concerns?  Are these questions
&gt; &gt;       examples of the kinds of questions that should be addressed in
&gt; &gt;       a discussion of the foundations of ontology?  I'm particularly
&gt; &gt;       interested in what I loosely call "consistency" and the
&gt; &gt;       possible relationships between what might be called the
&gt; &gt;       "internal consistency" of the World, the "internal consistency"
&gt; &gt;       of the Model, and the consistency of the Model as an approximation to
&gt; &gt;       the World.  Are these kinds of issues fitting ones to be addressed
&gt; &gt;       in considering the foundations of ontology?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       2. What is the distinction between Model and Theory in
&gt; &gt;       John Sowa's diagram?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       One way of considering this question might be to ask if
&gt; &gt;       the Model and the Theory both represent self-contained worlds
&gt; &gt;       in the sense that neither depends on a metalanguage (from
&gt; &gt;       the World) in order to "make internal sense".  Do the Model
&gt; &gt;       and the Theory differ in this regard, and is it significant
&gt; &gt;       whether they do?  What I am suggesting is that there may be
&gt; &gt;       a useful analogy between,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       on the one hand,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       the kind of language we use to talk about and delimit a given
&gt; &gt;       subject domain, and the language we use to talk about the context
&gt; &gt;       or connections between this subject domain and a larger world
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       and on the other hand,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       the kind of language used in describing and delimiting a "Model"
&gt; &gt;       or a "Theory," and the language we use to talk about the connections
&gt; &gt;       between a "Model" or "Theory" and the "World".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       I don't know if such an analogy exists. But I think if it does
&gt; &gt;       exist, its significance may have something to do with "insides"
&gt; &gt;       and "outsides" in the sense that the language used "in" certain
&gt; &gt;       domains may be inadequate for describing what is outside the domain
&gt; &gt;       or the connections between what lies inside the domain and what
&gt; &gt;       lies outside of it.  Perhaps this is just a truism, but it seems
&gt; &gt;       to be possibly based on a spatial use of language, and it may
&gt; &gt;       have implications as a foundational issue for ontologies.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       One answer to the question (what is the distinction between the
&gt; &gt;       Model and the Theory) may be that the Theory has no direct
&gt; &gt;       connection with the World, but the Model does.  Would this mean then
&gt; &gt;       that there is no explicit way to relate the truth or falsity
&gt; &gt;       established by the connection of "Model" and "Theory" to anything in
&gt; &gt;       the "World"?  Is there any implicit relationship between such truth
&gt; &gt;       or falsity and the quality of the "Model's" approximation to the
&gt; &gt;       "World"?  If there is an implicit relationship, is a consideration of
&gt; &gt;       the ways in which this relationship can be made explicit something
&gt; &gt;       that should be addressed in the foundations of ontology?
&gt; &gt;       (I believe this is what John Sowa was referring to in his
&gt; &gt;       6th point in the 2nd posting, where he says:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;            "Finally, there is the question of how or whether the
&gt; &gt;            'individuals' in D [domain] and the 'relations' in
&gt; &gt;            R [ relational structure] correspond to anything in the world.
&gt; &gt;            This is a very important question that has not yet been
&gt; &gt;            adequately addressed.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       3. In general, what would be required so that the critical
&gt; &gt;          aspects that John speaks of can be specified in a way
&gt; &gt;          that some formalization in a language such as KIF would be
&gt; &gt;          possible?  Are there specific properties, for instance
&gt; &gt;          that a model or a theory must have before it can be so
&gt; &gt;          formalized?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; D. Summary
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     1. I'd like to know if people think I'm at all on target with
&gt; &gt;        my comments and questions, in the following ways:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       a. Have I identified some possible critical aspects of
&gt; &gt;          the foundations of ontology as John Sowa described
&gt; &gt;          this topic in posting 1 mentioned above?  If not, what
&gt; &gt;          kinds of issues are meant?  If I have, what are some
&gt; &gt;          other issues that might be treated?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       b. I believe that the pervasive use in English of spatial language
&gt; &gt;          as a way of understanding our world may constrain how we are
&gt; &gt;          able to create "Models" and "Theories" of the "World."
&gt; &gt;          I think spatial notions come into play particularly when
&gt; &gt;          we describe, on the one hand, narrow and relatively well-defined
&gt; &gt;          domains of inquiry, and, on the other hand, the relationships
&gt; &gt;          between these domains and what lies "outside" of them.  But I
&gt; &gt;          am not convinced that such "spatial issues" lie within
&gt; &gt;          the scope of the foundations of ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     2. I wonder whether it may make sense, in order to discover or create
&gt; &gt;        certain foundational principles, to work backwards so to speak
&gt; &gt;        and examine the kinds of ways that people have already
&gt; &gt;        created ontologies and the formalisms to express them.
&gt; &gt;        Would this be one operational way to approach the discussion
&gt; &gt;        of foundations?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     3. What are some other approaches that may be taken to examine
&gt; &gt;        the relevant principles for the foundations of ontology?
&gt; &gt;
