Pat

Thanks to step in that debate. I think we mixed two questions there. One is
about the definition of physical objects.
The other is about the "Quantity" categories. I had the latter in mind, but
maybe I was not clear enough about it and misleaded you to address the
former. I try to clarify below.

[PC]
&gt; Regarding the minimal attributes of a physical object:

[BV]
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; In the merged ontology, "physical" is defined (in the gloss) as an
entity
&gt; &gt; that has location in space-time &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; Space and time are not the only (physical) measurable, and other
attributes
&gt; &gt; (mass, energy, temperature, wavelength) . . .

[PC]
&gt;   First, note that "physical" subsumes processes, not just physical
&gt; objects.  The following comments are relevant to Bernard Vatant's
&gt; remarks, interpreted as applying to physical objects (as I believe he
&gt; intended).

[BV]
My intent was not to focus debate on definition of minimal attributes for a
physical object, but on the classification of attributes, and mainly what
lives under Quantity, and particularly to know if Space and Time were to be
considered as subcategories of a more generic category Measurable Quantity.
But if pushed on that ground, I would tend to consider in whatever physical
(object or process) no more than a set of measurable. Of course this is a
very restrictive (reductionist) ontology, but should satisfy a wide scope of
technical or science fields.
I'm sort of agnostic concerning the ontological status of "physical" anyway,
because there are too many entities, for example in the technologies field,
which I can't really classify under Physical nor Abstract. Is the software
I'm using right now to write this mail a physical object? a physical
process? an abstract object? I can make measures on it, like the number of
bytes it's taking on my HD, but when thinking about it, I just can't figure
... And what about virtual objects, to which I can assign values for
"virtual physical attributes" (?) e.g. Lara Croft's (virtual) we
ight and
size or max speed of Star Wars X-Wing? And we'll have more and more of those
around ... the ontology of virtual reality is here to stay and will not
simplify our task ...

[PC]
&gt;   In my own ontology I use mass as the defining characteristic of a
"physicalobject", but location in space-time is also legitimate, provided
that one uses "location" in the broad sense, meaning any one or more of a
point, region, or, if one is concerned with subatomic distances or
interference pattterns, statistical distribution through space (wave
function).
&gt;  "energy" is equivalent to mass, unless one wants to use "rest mass",
&gt; which would, however, eliminate electromagnetic waves as physical --
&gt; I prefer "relativistic mass".

[BV]
All that makes sense. But IMO defining a physical object out of one single
measurable leads to some examples very difficult to handle. Take any
arbitrary "empty" (in the usual sense of the term) small volume of
intergalactic space-time "containing only" diffuse galactic light and
cosmological background and whatever hypothetical non-hadronic "dark matter"
lurking there. Will you call that portion an "object"?. It has a mass-energy
content, right, but many people will be very reluctant to call it an
"object" ...
But it is "physical" anyway, in the sense you can define measurable
attributes for it, like position and mass-energy density.

 &gt; &gt; . . . are other measurable necessary to
&gt; &gt; define physical entities, . . .
&gt; &gt; . . . and I wonder
&gt; &gt; why these other attributes are not considered at the same level, along
with
&gt; &gt; space and time, under a generic "measurable attribute".

[PC]
&gt;    No, temperature and wavelength are relevant only for certain types of
&gt; physical objects; ordinary temperature is a statistical property of
&gt; large numbers of particles.  If you are thinking of the DeBroglie
&gt; wavelength, that is derivable from the mass.  Extended non-standard
&gt; definitions of those quantities might be attributed to many objects,
&gt; but that should not be forced on users.  That can be done at a lower
&gt; level.  The most general "physical object" can not have all measurable
&gt; attributes, only those common to all "physical objects".

[BV]
I do not pretend that the attributes were interchangeable as characteristics
of the "physical" nature.
What I am up to, again, is not the classification of objects, but the
classification of quantities.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; and many entities have no specific space-time
&gt; &gt; location (not to mention that quantum mechanics has somehow seriously
shaken
&gt; &gt; the notion of space-time location as making any sense at all),

[PC]
&gt;    I think it's best to
 keep the definitions in the SUO within the
&gt; realms of
&gt; common sense to the extent that they can be while still providing
&gt; consistency with modern physics.  If you really think that "location"
&gt; makes no sense at all, it would seem rather difficult or impossible to
&gt; create any ontology that is useful for practical purposes.

[BV]
Of course. We are about practical applications hence approximations. I'm
glad to read that. I pointed the quantum mechanics "view of the world"
exactly to show that the ontology we use at any level are approximations.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So it seems that Measurable is more generic than space and time.

[PC]
&gt;    "measurable" is an attribute of certain properties that matter may
&gt; or may not possess, and you would need a careful definition to make that
&gt; notion precise as a defining characteristic of material objects.

[BV]
Is not all knowledge all about being careful ? ;o)
Even if we don't export QM concepts all over the place, there is at least an
ontological one in the deepest sense of the term. Having a "measura
ble"
means than you can conduct a measure experiment and get quantitative
results. It does not mean that out there exists some matter or physical
object having "properties with measurable attribute(s)". Or in any case any
other aspect - including existence - than these measures are often
irrelevant. The measure is hence the more fundamental concept, and the
notion of physical object is derived from the measure process if ever we
need it, and this is not always the case. And this is very pragmatic. When
measuring the value of a temperature or a magnetic field intensity or a
pression or a star position, one is generally most interested by these
values themselves and does not care about whatever object of which they are
attributes.

[PC]
  &gt; Is some object many trillions of light-years away in an inflationary
&gt; universe, and moving away at near light-speed "measurable"?  by whom?

[BV]
If it's not measurable, it's not physical IMO. Measures maybe very
inaccurate in this case - trillions of LY seems very far indeed in our
universe! But: either you get information, which means you have made an
observation (data acquisition) and measured quantities, either you have no
measurable, and the problem is that you "imagine an object" before any
measure was done and declare its physical existence. Is it more physical
than Lara Croft? :o)

But cosmological examples arise quite interesting questions anyway. For
example stars have been defined for centuries as set of measurements
(positions in the sky) before the question of physical objects behind those
measurements was even asked. The nature of stars as physical objects was
clearly rebuilt out of sets of measurable (mainly spectrum). We had more
recently the same ex
perience with quasars and gravitational mirages and
other weird deep-sky "objects". And we have the "dark matter" which has only
for the moment only theoretical existence and not the least set of
measurable about it. Where do you put it? Physical or Abstract? (90% or such
of our universe mass if it "exists" ... difficult to call that an
abstraction)

[PC]
&gt;    If mass alone, or mass plus location are inadequate as generic
&gt; defining characteristics of a "physical object", it would be helpful
&gt; if someone could find a counterexample either
&gt; (1) of a physical object that doesn't have those characteristics,
&gt;  or (2) a non-physical object that does.

[BV]
But why do we need such a concept than "genering defining characteristics of
a physical object"?

Bernard
