&gt; | MS 381 -- On the Nature of Signs .
&gt; |
&gt; | A sign is an object which stands for another to some mind.
&gt; | I propose to describe the characters of a sign.  In the first
&gt; | place like any other thing it must have qualities which belong
&gt; | to it whether it be regarded as a sign or not thus a printed word
&gt; | is black, has a certain number of letters and those letters have
&gt; | certain shapes.  Such characters of a sign I call its material
&gt; | quality.  In the next place a sign must have some real connection
&gt; | with the thing it signifies so that when the object is present or
&gt; | is so as the sign signifies it to be the sign shall so signify it
&gt; | and otherwise not.  [...]  In the first place it is necessary for
&gt; | a sign to be a sign that it should be regarded as a sign for it is
&gt; | only a sign to that mind which so considers and if it is not a sign
&gt; | to any mind it is not a sign at all.  It must be known to the mind
&gt; | first in its material qualities but also in its pure demonstrative
&gt; | application.  That mind must conceive it to be connected with its
&gt; | object so that it is possible to reason from the sign to the thing.
&gt; 
&gt; A sign is a sign only if it is considered with the two other
&gt; correlates (object, interpretant), the material qualities (ex:
&gt; printed words, "signs" on the screen) are signs insofar as mind
&gt; connects them to an object that mind is already acquainted with.
&gt; Material qualities by themselves are not necessarily signs (cf.
&gt; "if it is not a sign to any mind it is not a sign at all").

Jean-Marc,

Every technical writer who has ever dared to write up an adaptation
for a particular audience, an application to a specialized subdomain,
or a popularization of his or her own technical work, no doubt looks
forward to a reader such as you -- that would be irony if I let it
go at that, so I won't -- with fear and trembling and a sickness
unto death.  If you were a new and unknown person to me, and
this were the very first time that the topic had come up in
our conversations, I would now dutifully trudge off, like
some Hansel in the forest, to gather up all of the clearly
labelled sops that truth-in-adversizing demands and that
Cerberus had yet omitted to gobble up, and I would then
politely explain the facts of life to you, in so far as
they concern anyone who finds occasion to write several
variations on the same theme, to wit, that it is only
the approximate whole of a person's work that must be
read in the context of itself, its immediate audience,
and its mediate purpose.  But we are past that point,
thee and me, and so I no longer feel the need to be
dutiful or even polite.  I am not one of those whose
suckers for that bit of a fish-monger's red herring
about the fights that the Old Peirce was supposed
to have had with the Young Peirce -- it is only
the struggle between the popular Elvis and the
real Elvis, and everybody knows how that song 
goes, leastwise, anybody who has been paying
attention and chooses to apply a modicum of
good sense to the issues of interpretation.

Get Real!

Jon
