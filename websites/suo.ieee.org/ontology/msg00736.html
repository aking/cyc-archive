<PRE>

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;	I am considering making three major changes to the version of the
&gt;merged ontology document that I sent out on January 12th, and I would like
&gt;to solicit comments.

Let me make a general comment, which arises from a recent discussion 
with Fritz Lehmann. He made the interesting observation that Cycorp 
have found that many of the most useful areas for writing axioms can 
be identified as those concerned with what might be called 
'conceptually mixed' entities: things which cannot be entirely 
classified into one of the traditional ontological classifications 
but which have aspects of both. His example was 'informational 
objects', meaning physical things which carry information. Its easy 
to think of examples: scripts, notes, letters, email messages, 
magnetic tapes, movie film, etc. . What makes this a useful category, 
according to Fritz, is precisely that they do NOT fit wholly under 
one of the traditional classifications, which tend to make a sharp, 
high-level distinction between 'abstract' and 'concrete', and then 
put anything to do with information or structure under the former and 
anything physical under the latter. In other words, the traditional 
high-level classifications are useful, but they are most useful not 
as ways of categorising things, but as ways of classifying *aspects* 
of things, in some sense: and the most interesting things to focus on 
are those that have more than one aspect.  I found this a very 
interesting and compelling observation, and one that might have deep 
implications for the SUO.  In particular, many of the Sowa 
classifications are pretty dreadful if thought of as classifying 
things into disjoint categories, but they might be much more useful 
thought of as classifications of 'aspects' of things.

Anyway, I would like to just get this issue on the table for now as 
something to discuss.

&gt;The proposed changes are as follows.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Simplify the tip of the ontology so that it has the following structure.

Certainly this simplification is a great improvement, but it retains 
many of the most worrisome and misleading confusions of the original.

&gt;(subclass-of Individual Entity)
&gt;(subclass-of Relation Entity)
&gt;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)

The continuant/occurrent distinction, while popular, has many 
problems. Many things can be seen in either way, and indeed for many 
ordinary reasoning processes *must* be thought of in both ways: an 
ocean wave and a flame are two of my favorite examples, but others 
include weather phenomena, many chemical and biochemical processes, 
and various dynamic aspects of working industrial machinery 
(especially those involving moving liquids, such as combustion or 
hydraulics). If we are forced into a rigorous high-level distinction 
between 'things' and 'processes' as mutually exlcusive, then this in 
turn forces our practical ontologies to make many artificial 
distinctions which just get in the damned way, eg between a 
cloud-as-a-thing and a cloud-as-a-process, or between things and 
their lifetimes in a 4-d ontology. There is no need to do this, other 
than to satisfy a rather naive philosophical doctrine which is based 
on very shaky linguistic intuitions.

&gt;(subclass-of Object Physical)
&gt;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt;(subclass-of Process Physical)
&gt;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)

I have a serious problem with the following (I was preparing a longer 
document about this, but I can cover the essential point in this 
message:)

&gt;(subclass-of Schema Abstract)
&gt;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)

This conflation of 'abstract' and 'continuant' doesn't seem to make 
sense. An 'abstract' is something which stands outside time: it has 
no temporal aspect or dependence at all; it doesnt even make sense to 
ask temporal questions about it.  (From the Sowa explanation: " Forms 
can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects such 
as sets and relations, but instances of forms cannot exist at a 
particular place and time without some physical encoding or 
embodiment. Whitehead called them "eternal objects" because they are 
independent of space and time." )
But a continuant is defined to be something that retains its identity 
during some time-interval. (Sowa again: "A continuant is an entity 
whose identity continues to be recognizable over some extended 
interval of time." )

So this notion of 'schema' seems incoherent; and since a lot of 
rather important stuff is classified under it, none of that makes 
sense either. This seems to me to be the single most central 
conceptual bug in the entire scheme, and one that must be repaired 
before the ontology can be of any real use.

Similar objections apply to "Script", for the same reason, since 
'occurrent' means something that has a temporal location.

&gt;(subclass-of Script Abstract)
&gt;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)

I have a similar problem understanding the following categories. In 
any sense of 'relation' I understand, it doesnt make sense to say 
that a relation is either a continuant or an occurent. Relations 
don't exist through time, they hold between entities. So what do 
these categories even mean?

&gt;(subclass-of Structure Relation)
&gt;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt;(subclass-of Situation Relation)
&gt;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt;
&gt;For reference, the original upper-level class hierarchy, as proposed by John
&gt;Sowa, is as follows.
&gt;
&gt;;;(subclass-of Independent Entity)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Relative Entity)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Mediating Entity)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt;
&gt;;;(subclass-of Actuality Independent)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Actuality Physical)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Form Independent)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Form Abstract)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Prehension Physical)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Prehension Relative)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Proposition Relative)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Proposition Abstract)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Nexus Physical)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Nexus Mediating)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Intention Abstract)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Intention Mediating)
&gt;
&gt;;;(subclass-of Object Actuality)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Process Actuality)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Schema Form)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Script Form)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Juncture Prehension)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Juncture Continuant)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Participation Prehension)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Participation Occurrent)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Description Proposition)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Description Continuant)
&gt;;;(subclass-of History Proposition)
&gt;;;(subclass-of History Occurrent)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Structure Nexus)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Situation Nexus)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Reason Intention)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Reason Continuant)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Purpose Intention)
&gt;;;(subclass-of Purpose Occurrent)
&gt;
&gt;2.  Recast the docu-strings for the high-level concepts in non-philosophical
&gt;language (so that their meaning is clear to engineers without a
&gt;philosophical background).

A noble ambition, but I doubt if it can be done. These are, after 
all, philosophical distinctions. Certainly these revisions don't cut 
it; and in fact I don't think they really make sense, in places.

&gt; The revised docu-strings follow.
&gt;
&gt;(documentation Abstract "Pure information as distinguished from any
&gt;particular encoding of the information in a physical medium.

It is potentially misleading to refer to 'information' here. I doubt 
if many philosophers of mathematics or even working mathematicians 
would agree that the integers, for example, consisted of information. 
Suppose an engineer were to ask, reasonably enough, how many bytes 
were needed to encode the platonic ideal sphere?

&gt; Instances of
&gt;Abstract can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects

Again, the term 'mathematical object' is potentially misleading.

&gt;such
&gt;as sets and relations, but they cannot exist at a particular place and time
&gt;without some physical encoding or embodiment.")
&gt;
&gt;(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do not have spatial
&gt;dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, grammars, and the data
&gt;structures of computer science.  All the syntactic forms in natural
&gt;languages, programming languages, and versions of symbolic logic are
&gt;included under Arrangement.")

I honestly do not follow this. In my world, the forms of a language 
DO have spatial dimensions. The notion of a font size makes sense, 
for example, and data structures occupy physical memory. Linguistic 
forms are not mathematical abstractions (which is why the type/token 
contrast makes sense.)

And why say only that mathematical abstractions don't have *spatial* 
dimensions? They also don't have temporal dimensions, or physical 
attributes, etc.; in fact there is quite a lot that they don't have.

But there's a deeper problem here in any case. This notion reflects a 
particular philosophy of mathematics which , while it is popular 
among pure mathematicians, isn't very useful in the real world. On 
this view, mathematics talks about a purely platonic world of 
"mathematical objects", in contrast to the physical world. I think 
this is a popular but fundamental mistake: mathematics in fact talks 
about anything, and this abstract 'platonic' world is a fictional way 
of refusing to commit oneself as to what particular thing one is 
talking about. Take the natural numbers, for example. When a shepherd 
stands counting his sheep, is he in fact talking about an abstract 
world of numbers which is in 1:1 correspondence with his sheep? No: 
he is talking about his sheep, and counting *them*. The philosophical 
need to postulate a world of 'pure numbers' arises when one wants to 
analyse the act of counting 'in the abstract', ie unencumbered by 
saying what particular things are being counted. But most of our 
ontologizing in practice is going to be about actual things; about 
sheep, not integers.

&gt;(documentation Assembly "A CorpuscularObject whose discrete parts are
&gt;completely separable.

What does 'completely separable' mean? (I can have the paint 
sandblasted off my car: is it therefore completely separable?)

This kind of distinction is like that between 'big' and 'small'. It 
is meaningful only in context, or as a comparative. One assembly 
might be more separable than another, in some sense, but nothing is 
either completely separable or completely inseparable. With enough 
energy input, you can probably take a quark apart.

The rest of this explanation (below) is an extended riff on the theme 
of just how completely useless this distinction is for making any 
kind of classification. Apparently, a car can flip from being an 
assembly to not being one just by a shift in the intentions (or 
attentions) of the people who are thinking about what to do with it. 
OBVIOUSLY this isn't a useful way to classify things.

&gt;Whether something is considered an unstructured
&gt;collection or a structured assembly depends on some agent's intention.  A
&gt;car in working order is a highly structured assembly.  But if the parts were
&gt;disassembled and spread out on some surface, it would be called a
&gt;collection.  Yet if the parts were arranged to spell the word 'CAR', they
&gt;would again form an assembly, although not one that could be used for
&gt;transportation. Conversely, if a car were towed to the junk yard, the junk
&gt;dealer might consider it a collection, even though the parts were in the
&gt;same order they had been in while it was running.")
&gt;
&gt;(documentation Attribute "Primitive schemas, i.e. schemas that cannot be
&gt;defined in terms of other schemas.  Some examples are:  colors, tastes,
&gt;intensities, etc.")

In what sense is a taste or a color a 'schema'? Color is a physical 
property of a surface (it has to do with the structure of the 
reflectance spectrum of the surface); it isnt a 'schema' in any sense 
I am aware of. It certainly isnt an "abstract form that has the 
structure of a continuant".  'intensity' seems to be, if anything, 
some kind of measuring scale (or maybe a class of such scales); 
again, I wouldnt put it into the same class as a taste or a color. 
(For example, tastes themselves might be more or less intense, so it 
would seem that intensity is something that *applies* to tastes, 
rather than being in the same category as tastes.)

I find this category completely without utility. I would never be 
inclined to use it in any ontological heirarchy, and if it was there 
it would just get in my way. Why, for example, should an attribute 
not be definable in terms of other attributes? Is sweet/sour not an 
attribute, if sweet and sour are?

&gt;(documentation CaseRole "The class of predicates relating the spatially
&gt;distinguished parts of an occurrent. Case roles include the agent, patient
&gt;or recipient of an action, the flammable substance in a burning process, or
&gt;the water that falls in rain.")

Another useless category. 'case role' is a LINGUISTIC idea, not an 
ontological one. (And it is only meaningful within one approach to 
describing linguistic structure which in any case isn't in the 
theoretical mainstream.)

More generally, almost all the categorisations in this ontology which 
depend on the occurrent/continuant distinction are fundamentally 
linguistic rather than ontological. They reflect ways of *talking* 
about the world, rather than ways the world in fact is. Since the 
very same thing can often - usually - be described as either a 
continuant or an occurrent, these pseudo-categories reflect an 
attitude rather than an objective structure. For example, take the 
'water that falls in rain' example (which ought really to say the 
*drops* of water that fall in rain). If a rain is an event (or 
process) then the raindrops might be said to be its spatial parts, 
but then they could also be the spatial parts of the rainstorm 
considered as a continuant (rainstorms retain their identity through 
time, and even move across the landscape at measurable velocities. 
Some rainstorms even have been given proper names.); and moreover, 
since a raindrop is falling, it can itself be considered to be an 
occurrent, which is a part (in a different 'subprocess' sense) of a 
larger occurrent, and also a part (in yet another sense, if we are 
forced into making the high-level distinction between things and 
processes) of a continuant. In fact, one can take almost any 
reasonably well-defined and connected chunk of space-time and split 
it into pieces along spacelike boundaries (to get 'case roles') or 
along time-like boundaries (to get some other category of 'pieces') , 
but one can also split it along other, more complex, planes of 
division. If some piece of a machine starts to move, one can split 
the space-time of the machine so as to focus on, say, the leading 
edge of the moving part during the movement (is this an occurrent or 
a continuant? Why should I give a damn?)

&gt;(documentation ComponentRelation "An umbrella class for any binary relation
&gt;that relates an Object to an aspect of that object.  The three elements of
&gt;ComponentRelation are part-of, property-of, and stage-of.")

What on earth does that mean? What is an aspect? (What isn't an 
aspect, better question.) How can a binary relation have three 
'elements'?

&gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is an entity whose identity
&gt;continues to be recognizable over some extended interval of time.")

This is a very poor definition, by the way, since almost *anything* 
physical has an identity which extends over *some* period of time. 
Also, it is a mistake to introduce the essentially epistemic notion 
of 'recognizable' into what ought to be a clearly non-epistemic 
notion. The classical definition of continuant is something which is 
such that all its parts are wholly present whenever it is present, 
which means essentially that its parts are considered to be spatial 
rather than temporal. So a human body, say, is a continuant, while a 
race or a football match are not, since they have temporal 'parts' 
like beginnings and endings or first and second halves.

&gt;(documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is indefinitely divisible to
&gt;the limits of perception by the available sense organs or measuring
&gt;instruments.")

How do we classify things which are partly continuous and partly not? 
(You know, like almost any complicated piece of machinery, say; or a 
company, for example.)
Again, it is poor strategy to introduce epistemic notions like 
perception into the explanation.

&gt;(documentation ContinuousProcess "A process in which incremental changes
&gt;take place continuously.  This is the normal kind of physical process.")
&gt;
&gt;(documentation CorpuscularObject "An Object that has separable parts.")

See earlier comments on 'separable'.

&gt;(documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which is typical of
&gt;computer programs or idealized approximations to physical processes, changes
&gt;occur in discrete steps called events, which are interleaved with periods of
&gt;inactivity called states.")

This is a neat idea, but very hard to get right. The problem is to 
say just what a period of inactivity is. That seems obvious until you 
try to axiomatize it. For example, consider someone who falls asleep 
while leaning on a door, thereby preventing the door from opening. In 
a sense he isnt doing anything, just being there in an inactive 
state; but if someone is trying to open the door, he IS doing 
something: he is preventing them opening the door. (Under the right 
surrounding circumstances he could be accused of negligent homicide.) 
In computers we do have a fairly clear criterion for this notion of 
'inactivity', but computers are carefully crafted to make that 
possible. On the other hand, there are plenty of examples of physical 
processes which are best described as discrete, eg the motion of a 
shuttle in a loom, or the action of a valve tappet; but these are not 
interleaved with complete inactivity.

&gt;(documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals.  This is the root
&gt;node of the ontology.")
&gt;
&gt;(documentation HomogeneousObject "A ContinuousObject in which every part is
&gt;similar to every other in every relevant respect, e.g., temperature,
&gt;chemical constitution, density, etc.  An example would be a beaker of pure
&gt;distilled water in a controlled environment.")

This depends crucially on what you consider to be a 'relevant' 
aspect. See later comments on variableObject.

&gt;(documentation Individual "An entity that can be characterized independently
&gt;of any relationships it may have to other entities.")
&gt;
&gt;(documentation KineticForm "Includes the information in a reel of motion
&gt;picture film or the patterns and equations for generating motion in virtual
&gt;reality.")

See comments on 'script' later.

&gt;(documentation Object "A Physical Continuant which retains its identity over
&gt;some interval of time. Although no physical entity is ever permanent, an
&gt;object can have stable properties over its lifespan. The type Object
&gt;includes ordinary physical objects as well as the instantiations of classes
&gt;in object-oriented programming languages.")

That last sentence is in direct opposition to the notion that 
datastructures are 'arrangements' (see above), since in that case 
they are not physical objects. You can't have it both ways. (I think 
this an extremely silly idea, and amounts to basing a primary 
ontological classification on a simple pun. It would be like claiming 
that subatomic particles should be classified with fruit because they 
both have colors.)

&gt;(documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a stable identity
&gt;during any interval of time. Formally, Occurrent satisfies the following
&gt;conditions:
&gt;   * The temporal parts of an occurrent exist at different times.
&gt;   * The spatial parts of an occurrent may exist at the same time, but an
&gt;occurrent may have 	different spatial parts at different times
&gt;   * There are no identity conditions that can be used to identify two
&gt;occurrents that are 	observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions.
&gt;A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different stages of a
&gt;life cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant, such as the
&gt;person's fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable identity conditions
&gt;at each stage. Even then, the identification depends on an inference that
&gt;presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")

The above is highly incoherent. I will just make a few obvious comments.
1. the temporal parts of ANYTHING exist at different times, by 
definition of 'temporal part'. (What you ought to have said is that 
occurrents HAVE temporal parts, in contrast to continuants.)
2. A continuant can also have different spatial parts at different 
times: your body, for example, renews itself almost completely during 
an average year.
3. There ARE identity conditions which can be used to identify 
occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping spacetime regions. For 
example, one can identify the two halves of a soccer match.
4. Or, to take the other example, one CAN recognize two different 
stages in someone's life. And, contrary to Aristotle and his 
followers, this does NOT always require that a continuant be 
identified 'at each stage'. That might indeed be a sound basis for 
legal rules of evidence, but it is not a philosophical requirement. 
The basic identity condition for being two stages of one life are 
that there is a life of which the stages are stages, and that is all. 
Whether this 'life' is a continuant or an occurrent is irrelevant to 
the basic rule of identity.  Now, how one *recognizes* this identity 
is another matter, and a potentially very complicated one, requiring 
a detailed analysis of what it takes to perform an act of recognition 
and many other arcane and complex issues in psychology: but this is 
all COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to ontological classification.

&gt;(documentation OrganicObject "A CorpuscularObject such as a tree or flower
&gt;that has parts that are not completely separable, even though there are
&gt;discontinuities.")

Being organic is simply a matter of how well-connected your parts are 
to one another? It has nothing to do with carbon-based chemistry, or 
an elan vital, or nothing like that at all?

&gt;(documentation Physical "An entity that has a location in space-time.")

A technical question: do spaces and times themselves have a location 
in spacetime? (My own preference is to say not, but Cyc takes a 
different view. But either way, we need a clear answer to avoid 
rapidly descending into muddled axioms.)

&gt;(documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent specification of
&gt;actions and events: including: computer programs, finite-state machines,
&gt;Petri nets, robot commands, cooking recipes, musical scores, conference
&gt;schedules, driving directions, and the scripts of actions and dialog in
&gt;plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent a dynamic
&gt;process, it may have static parts.  In a movie film, for example, the
&gt;sequence of images is a script that determines the motion, but each frame is
&gt;a schema of a static image.")

See comments below on 'schema' and 'script'. Also this list is very 
confusing, since some of the things in it are linguistic in nature 
(computer programs), others are mathematical abstractions (Petri 
nets) and others are physical (musical scores and movie film). In 
what sense is a movie film a 'specification' ?

&gt;(documentation Process "A Physical Occurrent during the interval of
&gt;interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail, the same actual
&gt;entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic process. Even an entity
&gt;as stable as a diamond could be considered a process when viewed over a long
&gt;time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")

Quite. So there is no useful categorical distinction to be made, as I suggest.
(BTW, what is the 'interval of interest', exactly?)

&gt;(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In logic, the assertion
&gt;of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds to some aspect
&gt;or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an example, the
&gt;statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat characterizes the
&gt;entity named Yojo.")

This doesnt seem to distinguish the sentence from the proposition 
expressed by that sentence. Exactly what a proposition is, is a 
matter of controversy, but in at least one view, it isnt anything at 
all like a sentence. BTW, what exactly is the word "Cat" supposed to 
indicate in that last sentence?

&gt;(documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some other entity.")

? The relation is an entity in a relationship to some other entity? 
So if (R a b), R is not the relation, but a and b are? This is just 
nonsense.

&gt;(documentation Schema "An Abstract form that has the structure of a
&gt;Continuant and, thus, does not specify time or timelike relationships.
&gt;Examples include geometric forms, the syntactic structures of sentences in
&gt;some language, or the encodings of pictures in a multimedia system.")
&gt;
&gt;(documentation Script "An Abstract form that has the structure of an
&gt;Occurrent and, thus, represents time sequences.

Both of these (and 'kineticForm') are muddled ideas. They confuse the 
structure of the form with the structure of what the form describes. 
First, as noted earlier, abstract forms simply do not (cannot) have 
spatiotemporal properties such as being continuants or occurrents; 
but even if we were to somehow allow them to have such aspects, there 
is no connection between the structure of the form and the structure 
of what the form describes.  We are all intimately familiar with 
various notations which give spatial renderings of temporal 
relationships, and many of us have seen temporal representations of 
spatial relationships (a slow pan in a movie, for example). More 
acutely, there are many, many abstractions throughout mathematics 
which are entirely neutral as to the spatial or temporal aspects of 
their interpretation. The widespread Allen algebra of timeintervals 
for example is in fact a theory of intervals, and can be applied to 
spatial intervals just as well as to temporal ones.

&gt; Examples include computer
&gt;programs, a recipe for baking a cake, a sheet of music to be played on a
&gt;piano, or a differential equation that governs the evolution of a physical
&gt;process. A movie can be described by several different kinds of scripts: the
&gt;first is a specification of the actions and dialog to be acted out by
&gt;humans; but the sequence of frames in a reel of film is also a script that
&gt;determines a process carried out by a projector that generates flickering
&gt;images on a screen.")

A movie film, it seems, is many things at once. It is a continuant 
which is also a procedure which is also a script.

&gt;(documentation Sign "A Sign is considered as representing something to some
&gt;agent.")

Just a quibble, but I think that it might be more use to characterise 
a sign as something intended by one agent to represent something for 
another agent (or agents). People often find meaning in things that 
arent usually categorised as signs (except in a metaphorical sense), 
cf. many folk sayings about smoke and fire.

&gt;(documentation Situation "A Relational entity considered as an Occurrent. A
&gt;situation relates the participants in some process, whose stages may involve
&gt;different participants at different times.")
&gt;
&gt;(documentation Structure "A Relational entity considered as a Continuant. A
&gt;structure relates multiple objects whose connections constitute the
&gt;structure.")

Both the above are clumsy because of the awkwardness of the 
occurrent/continuant contrast. Rainstorms have a dynamic structure, 
for example, and cells (in biology) are structures which consist of 
interlocking processes. The very idea of 'dynamic equilibrium' 
couldnt be considered in this overly simplistic ontological 
classification.

&gt;(documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject that nonetheless varies
&gt;in, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, etc.  An example
&gt;would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")

Consider a homogenous object which has the same chemical consituency, 
temperature, etc., throughout; like a cube of pure gold. It is as 
unVariable as one could possibly achieve, let us suppose. 
Nevertheless, it does vary in some ways. Parts of it, for example, 
are further north than other parts, and again, some parts of it are 
higher in the gravity field than other parts. So its parts can be 
distinguished from each other. Now, is it therefore a VariableObject? 
I suspect you will want to say not, but on what basis? You cannot 
claim that *every* property of all its parts are shared by all its 
other parts. What I suspect you want to say is that all its parts 
have the same *intrinsic* properties, maybe, or maybe the same 
*physical* properties. Or maybe you could say that the object is made 
of the same *stuff* throughout. But in any case, you do need to say 
what it is you actually do mean.

&gt;3.  The third proposed change is to eliminate the axioms of the "Theory of
&gt;Holes".  As I see it, these axioms are very interesting, but they are also
&gt;controversial and probably more relevant in a philosophical context than an
&gt;engineering one like the SUO.

Well, engineering is largely concerned with holes, as a matter of 
fact (see any history of machine tools: all the great manufacturing 
advances were based on new ways to remove metal, usually so as to 
make holes with greater precision. Modern auto manufacturing began 
with the centerless precision grinder. ) So we will almost certainly 
need *some* ontology of holes. In fact, I think that this is likely 
to be a lot more use to engineering than all that stuff about scripts 
and situations and signs.
