&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	I am considering making three major changes to the 
&gt; version of the
&gt; &gt;merged ontology document that I sent out on January 12th, 
&gt; and I would like
&gt; &gt;to solicit comments.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me make a general comment, which arises from a recent discussion 
&gt; with Fritz Lehmann. He made the interesting observation that Cycorp 
&gt; have found that many of the most useful areas for writing axioms can 
&gt; be identified as those concerned with what might be called 
&gt; 'conceptually mixed' entities: things which cannot be entirely 
&gt; classified into one of the traditional ontological classifications 
&gt; but which have aspects of both. His example was 'informational 
&gt; objects', meaning physical things which carry information. Its easy 
&gt; to think of examples: scripts, notes, letters, email messages, 
&gt; magnetic tapes, movie film, etc. . What makes this a useful category, 
&gt; according to Fritz, is precisely that they do NOT fit wholly under 
&gt; one of the traditional classifications, which tend to make a sharp, 
&gt; high-level distinction between 'abstract' and 'concrete', and then 
&gt; put anything to do with information or structure under the former and 
&gt; anything physical under the latter. In other words, the traditional 
&gt; high-level classifications are useful, but they are most useful not 
&gt; as ways of categorising things, but as ways of classifying *aspects* 
&gt; of things, in some sense: and the most interesting things to focus on 
&gt; are those that have more than one aspect.  I found this a very 
&gt; interesting and compelling observation, and one that might have deep 
&gt; implications for the SUO.  In particular, many of the Sowa 
&gt; classifications are pretty dreadful if thought of as classifying 
&gt; things into disjoint categories, but they might be much more useful 
&gt; thought of as classifications of 'aspects' of things.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I would like to just get this issue on the table for now as 
&gt; something to discuss.

MW: We spent some 18 months to 2 years exploring this concept, and the
results are in the EPISTLE Core Model V3.1 - the latest publicly available
version, see:
<A  HREF="http://www.posccaesar.org/prodserv/epistle3.1/epistle.htm">http://www.posccaesar.org/prodserv/epistle3.1/epistle.htm</A>.
It has aspect as an explicit concept. So you can have a temperature aspect
of something, or an ownership aspect of something, or as you suggest an
information aspect of something. These aspects would then be classified to
tell you about them.

MW:  Considering aspect was something we found very useful as a catalyst
between our old 3D models with temporal associations, and the current 4D
view in Version 3.2. In the end we found that aspects introduced
considerable complexity. For example, how do you manage the change in the
temperature aspect of something? Is an aspect a 4D object? If not what is
it? 

MW: We found increasingly that what we were using were states, something for
a period of time. This could be classified as containing some particular
information, or as possessing a particular temperature. States can have
sub-states. We are satisfied that the current model can represent anything
that an aspect based model can represent, but in a simpler way.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The proposed changes are as follows.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1.  Simplify the tip of the ontology so that it has the 
&gt; following structure.
&gt; 
&gt; Certainly this simplification is a great improvement, but it retains 
&gt; many of the most worrisome and misleading confusions of the original.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Individual Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Relation Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; 
&gt; The continuant/occurrent distinction, while popular, has many 
&gt; problems. Many things can be seen in either way, and indeed for many 
&gt; ordinary reasoning processes *must* be thought of in both ways: an 
&gt; ocean wave and a flame are two of my favorite examples, but others 
&gt; include weather phenomena, many chemical and biochemical processes, 
&gt; and various dynamic aspects of working industrial machinery 
&gt; (especially those involving moving liquids, such as combustion or 
&gt; hydraulics). If we are forced into a rigorous high-level distinction 
&gt; between 'things' and 'processes' as mutually exlcusive, then this in 
&gt; turn forces our practical ontologies to make many artificial 
&gt; distinctions which just get in the damned way, eg between a 
&gt; cloud-as-a-thing and a cloud-as-a-process, or between things and 
&gt; their lifetimes in a 4-d ontology. There is no need to do this, other 
&gt; than to satisfy a rather naive philosophical doctrine which is based 
&gt; on very shaky linguistic intuitions.

MW: Couldn't agree more.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Object Physical)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Process Physical)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; 
&gt; I have a serious problem with the following (I was preparing a longer 
&gt; document about this, but I can cover the essential point in this 
&gt; message:)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Schema Abstract)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; 
&gt; This conflation of 'abstract' and 'continuant' doesn't seem to make 
&gt; sense. An 'abstract' is something which stands outside time: it has 
&gt; no temporal aspect or dependence at all; it doesnt even make sense to 
&gt; ask temporal questions about it.  (From the Sowa explanation: " Forms 
&gt; can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects such 
&gt; as sets and relations, but instances of forms cannot exist at a 
&gt; particular place and time without some physical encoding or 
&gt; embodiment. Whitehead called them "eternal objects" because they are 
&gt; independent of space and time." )
&gt; But a continuant is defined to be something that retains its identity 
&gt; during some time-interval. (Sowa again: "A continuant is an entity 
&gt; whose identity continues to be recognizable over some extended 
&gt; interval of time." )
&gt; 
&gt; So this notion of 'schema' seems incoherent; and since a lot of 
&gt; rather important stuff is classified under it, none of that makes 
&gt; sense either. This seems to me to be the single most central 
&gt; conceptual bug in the entire scheme, and one that must be repaired 
&gt; before the ontology can be of any real use.
&gt; 
&gt; Similar objections apply to "Script", for the same reason, since 
&gt; 'occurrent' means something that has a temporal location.
&gt; 
MW: I concur.

&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Script Abstract)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; 
&gt; I have a similar problem understanding the following categories. In 
&gt; any sense of 'relation' I understand, it doesnt make sense to say 
&gt; that a relation is either a continuant or an occurent. Relations 
&gt; don't exist through time, they hold between entities. So what do 
&gt; these categories even mean?

MW: Well I agree that is how relations should be used, but take the
relation:
(married Matthew Lydia)
This does not hold for all time. Of course the problem is that people are
modelling the wrong thing, but what some people do (and I have done - not
now recommended) is to add some temporal information to the relation, so
something like:

(married Matthew Lydia 3-Jul-1976 present) (yes 25 years coming up)

So what is this? You could call it a temporal relationship. There are
(believe me) worse things that people do.

(Of course it really represents the state of Matthew and the state of Lydia
from 3-Jul-1976 to the present, and a timeless relation between them, but
that is several steps away from what is represented here, which seems to be
a relationship that is also a spatio-temporal extent.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Structure Relation)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Situation Relation)
&gt; &gt;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For reference, the original upper-level class hierarchy, as 
&gt; proposed by John
&gt; &gt;Sowa, is as follows.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Independent Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Relative Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Mediating Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Actuality Independent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Actuality Physical)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Form Independent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Form Abstract)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Prehension Physical)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Prehension Relative)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Proposition Relative)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Proposition Abstract)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Nexus Physical)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Nexus Mediating)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Intention Abstract)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Intention Mediating)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Object Actuality)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Process Actuality)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Schema Form)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Script Form)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Juncture Prehension)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Juncture Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Participation Prehension)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Participation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Description Proposition)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Description Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of History Proposition)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of History Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Structure Nexus)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Situation Nexus)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Reason Intention)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Reason Continuant)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Purpose Intention)
&gt; &gt;;;(subclass-of Purpose Occurrent)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2.  Recast the docu-strings for the high-level concepts in 
&gt; non-philosophical
&gt; &gt;language (so that their meaning is clear to engineers without a
&gt; &gt;philosophical background).
&gt; 
&gt; A noble ambition, but I doubt if it can be done. These are, after 
&gt; all, philosophical distinctions. Certainly these revisions don't cut 
&gt; it; and in fact I don't think they really make sense, in places.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The revised docu-strings follow.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Abstract "Pure information as distinguished from any
&gt; &gt;particular encoding of the information in a physical medium.
&gt; 
&gt; It is potentially misleading to refer to 'information' here. I doubt 
&gt; if many philosophers of mathematics or even working mathematicians 
&gt; would agree that the integers, for example, consisted of information. 
&gt; Suppose an engineer were to ask, reasonably enough, how many bytes 
&gt; were needed to encode the platonic ideal sphere?

MW: I agree.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Instances of
&gt; &gt;Abstract can be said to exist in the same sense as 
&gt; mathematical objects
&gt; 
&gt; Again, the term 'mathematical object' is potentially misleading.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;such
&gt; &gt;as sets and relations, but they cannot exist at a particular 
&gt; place and time
&gt; &gt;without some physical encoding or embodiment.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do 
&gt; not have spatial
&gt; &gt;dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, grammars, and the data
&gt; &gt;structures of computer science.  All the syntactic forms in natural
&gt; &gt;languages, programming languages, and versions of symbolic logic are
&gt; &gt;included under Arrangement.")
&gt; 
&gt; I honestly do not follow this. In my world, the forms of a language 
&gt; DO have spatial dimensions. The notion of a font size makes sense, 
&gt; for example, and data structures occupy physical memory. Linguistic 
&gt; forms are not mathematical abstractions (which is why the type/token 
&gt; contrast makes sense.)
&gt; 
&gt; And why say only that mathematical abstractions don't have *spatial* 
&gt; dimensions? They also don't have temporal dimensions, or physical 
&gt; attributes, etc.; in fact there is quite a lot that they don't have.
&gt; 
&gt; But there's a deeper problem here in any case. This notion reflects a 
&gt; particular philosophy of mathematics which , while it is popular 
&gt; among pure mathematicians, isn't very useful in the real world. On 
&gt; this view, mathematics talks about a purely platonic world of 
&gt; "mathematical objects", in contrast to the physical world. I think 
&gt; this is a popular but fundamental mistake: mathematics in fact talks 
&gt; about anything, and this abstract 'platonic' world is a fictional way 
&gt; of refusing to commit oneself as to what particular thing one is 
&gt; talking about. Take the natural numbers, for example. When a shepherd 
&gt; stands counting his sheep, is he in fact talking about an abstract 
&gt; world of numbers which is in 1:1 correspondence with his sheep? No: 
&gt; he is talking about his sheep, and counting *them*. The philosophical 
&gt; need to postulate a world of 'pure numbers' arises when one wants to 
&gt; analyse the act of counting 'in the abstract', ie unencumbered by 
&gt; saying what particular things are being counted. But most of our 
&gt; ontologizing in practice is going to be about actual things; about 
&gt; sheep, not integers.

MW: Oh this is rather interesting. I am having just this sort of discussion
with one of my colleagues about adding some mathematical concepts to the
EPISTLE Core Model. I will pass your reflections on to him.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Assembly "A CorpuscularObject whose discrete parts are
&gt; &gt;completely separable.
&gt; 
&gt; What does 'completely separable' mean? (I can have the paint 
&gt; sandblasted off my car: is it therefore completely separable?)

MW: OK here I will come to Ian's defence. I am sure what Ian means is
something that can be taken apart and put back together again repeatedly
without damage.

So the paint is not separable from your car, because it can't be reassembled
(or at least only with extreme difficulty).
&gt; 
&gt; This kind of distinction is like that between 'big' and 'small'. It 
&gt; is meaningful only in context, or as a comparative. One assembly 
&gt; might be more separable than another, in some sense, but nothing is 
&gt; either completely separable or completely inseparable. With enough 
&gt; energy input, you can probably take a quark apart.

MW: This is of course true in a general sense, but this is rather different
than things that are designed to be assembled and dissassembled, as many
artifacts are.

MW: Of course the definition could be improved to make this clear.
&gt; 
&gt; The rest of this explanation (below) is an extended riff on the theme 
&gt; of just how completely useless this distinction is for making any 
&gt; kind of classification. Apparently, a car can flip from being an 
&gt; assembly to not being one just by a shift in the intentions (or 
&gt; attentions) of the people who are thinking about what to do with it. 
&gt; OBVIOUSLY this isn't a useful way to classify things.

MW: Well I have used pretty much just this example to explain the difference
between a collection (sense of fusion) and an assembly relation between a
whole and its parts. I'm not sure if this is Ian's sense here. He seems to
be talking about the wholes, rather than the relations but the distinction
is much the same. The key is that with a collection (fusion) the whole is
precisely the sum of the parts, with an assembly the whole is something more
than the sum of the parts. It is quite interesting just how many sorts of
whole/part there are (and which ones really are distinct and useful).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Whether something is considered an unstructured
&gt; &gt;collection or a structured assembly depends on some agent's 
&gt; intention.  A
&gt; &gt;car in working order is a highly structured assembly.  But 
&gt; if the parts were
&gt; &gt;disassembled and spread out on some surface, it would be called a
&gt; &gt;collection.  Yet if the parts were arranged to spell the 
&gt; word 'CAR', they
&gt; &gt;would again form an assembly, although not one that could be used for
&gt; &gt;transportation. Conversely, if a car were towed to the junk 
&gt; yard, the junk
&gt; &gt;dealer might consider it a collection, even though the parts 
&gt; were in the
&gt; &gt;same order they had been in while it was running.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Attribute "Primitive schemas, i.e. schemas 
&gt; that cannot be
&gt; &gt;defined in terms of other schemas.  Some examples are:  
&gt; colors, tastes,
&gt; &gt;intensities, etc.")
&gt; 
&gt; In what sense is a taste or a color a 'schema'? Color is a physical 
&gt; property of a surface (it has to do with the structure of the 
&gt; reflectance spectrum of the surface); it isnt a 'schema' in any sense 
&gt; I am aware of. It certainly isnt an "abstract form that has the 
&gt; structure of a continuant".  'intensity' seems to be, if anything, 
&gt; some kind of measuring scale (or maybe a class of such scales); 
&gt; again, I wouldnt put it into the same class as a taste or a color. 
&gt; (For example, tastes themselves might be more or less intense, so it 
&gt; would seem that intensity is something that *applies* to tastes, 
&gt; rather than being in the same category as tastes.)
&gt; 
&gt; I find this category completely without utility. I would never be 
&gt; inclined to use it in any ontological heirarchy, and if it was there 
&gt; it would just get in my way. Why, for example, should an attribute 
&gt; not be definable in terms of other attributes? Is sweet/sour not an 
&gt; attribute, if sweet and sour are?

MW: I agree.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation CaseRole "The class of predicates relating 
&gt; the spatially
&gt; &gt;distinguished parts of an occurrent. Case roles include the 
&gt; agent, patient
&gt; &gt;or recipient of an action, the flammable substance in a 
&gt; burning process, or
&gt; &gt;the water that falls in rain.")
&gt; 
&gt; Another useless category. 'case role' is a LINGUISTIC idea, not an 
&gt; ontological one. (And it is only meaningful within one approach to 
&gt; describing linguistic structure which in any case isn't in the 
&gt; theoretical mainstream.)
&gt; 
&gt; More generally, almost all the categorisations in this ontology which 
&gt; depend on the occurrent/continuant distinction are fundamentally 
&gt; linguistic rather than ontological. They reflect ways of *talking* 
&gt; about the world, rather than ways the world in fact is. 

MW: I particularly agree with this. I find to much of what we do here is
analysing how we talk, and not what we talk about.

&gt; Since the 
&gt; very same thing can often - usually - be described as either a 
&gt; continuant or an occurrent, these pseudo-categories reflect an 
&gt; attitude rather than an objective structure. For example, take the 
&gt; 'water that falls in rain' example (which ought really to say the 
&gt; *drops* of water that fall in rain). If a rain is an event (or 
&gt; process) then the raindrops might be said to be its spatial parts, 
&gt; but then they could also be the spatial parts of the rainstorm 
&gt; considered as a continuant (rainstorms retain their identity through 
&gt; time, and even move across the landscape at measurable velocities. 
&gt; Some rainstorms even have been given proper names.); and moreover, 
&gt; since a raindrop is falling, it can itself be considered to be an 
&gt; occurrent, which is a part (in a different 'subprocess' sense) of a 
&gt; larger occurrent, and also a part (in yet another sense, if we are 
&gt; forced into making the high-level distinction between things and 
&gt; processes) of a continuant. In fact, one can take almost any 
&gt; reasonably well-defined and connected chunk of space-time and split 
&gt; it into pieces along spacelike boundaries (to get 'case roles') or 
&gt; along time-like boundaries (to get some other category of 'pieces') , 
&gt; but one can also split it along other, more complex, planes of 
&gt; division. If some piece of a machine starts to move, one can split 
&gt; the space-time of the machine so as to focus on, say, the leading 
&gt; edge of the moving part during the movement (is this an occurrent or 
&gt; a continuant? Why should I give a damn?)

MW: Quite - not that I would use such language :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation ComponentRelation "An umbrella class for any 
&gt; binary relation
&gt; &gt;that relates an Object to an aspect of that object.  The 
&gt; three elements of
&gt; &gt;ComponentRelation are part-of, property-of, and stage-of.")
&gt; 
&gt; What on earth does that mean? 

MW: It isn't that obscure a word.

&gt; What is an aspect? (What isn't an 
&gt; aspect, better question.) 

MW: Well I would generally recon a temporal whole thing (e.g. me for the
whole of my life) was not an aspect. This was one of the primary
distinctions we made in EPISTLE Core Model 3.1, between aspect and whole.
This gets a little muddied when you think of states as aspects (as we did)
since you can get the situation where a whole is a state of something else
(like a vase being a state of a piece of clay).

&gt; How can a binary relation have three 
&gt; 'elements'?

MW: Good point.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is an entity whose identity
&gt; &gt;continues to be recognizable over some extended interval of time.")
&gt; 
&gt; This is a very poor definition, by the way, since almost *anything* 
&gt; physical has an identity which extends over *some* period of time. 
&gt; Also, it is a mistake to introduce the essentially epistemic notion 
&gt; of 'recognizable' into what ought to be a clearly non-epistemic 
&gt; notion. The classical definition of continuant is something which is 
&gt; such that all its parts are wholly present whenever it is present, 
&gt; which means essentially that its parts are considered to be spatial 
&gt; rather than temporal. So a human body, say, is a continuant, while a 
&gt; race or a football match are not, since they have temporal 'parts' 
&gt; like beginnings and endings or first and second halves.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is 
&gt; indefinitely divisible to
&gt; &gt;the limits of perception by the available sense organs or measuring
&gt; &gt;instruments.")
&gt; 
&gt; How do we classify things which are partly continuous and partly not? 
&gt; (You know, like almost any complicated piece of machinery, say; or a 
&gt; company, for example.)
&gt; Again, it is poor strategy to introduce epistemic notions like 
&gt; perception into the explanation.
&gt; 

MW: This is also a matter of scale. If I have a glass of water, I can easily
divide it up until I get to a single water molecule, but then division is
impossible withou deconstructing the water molecule (and there are certainly
instruments that can perceive a water molecule). The same thing happens with
sand. However, a football crowd could just as easily be treated as something
continuous, or traffic, or a galaxy. Something being continuous really says
that you are only interested in properties at an aggregate level relative to
the scale of the objects that make up the thing that is continuous.

MW: Treating something as continuous is something we do - usually for
mathematical convenience, but it is not what anything is. (You might have
some discussion  about this at the sub-atomic scale, but that is largely a
reflection of this being where the boudaries of knowledge lie at present.)

&gt; &gt;(documentation ContinuousProcess "A process in which 
&gt; incremental changes
&gt; &gt;take place continuously.  This is the normal kind of 
&gt; physical process.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation CorpuscularObject "An Object that has 
&gt; separable parts.")
&gt; 
&gt; See earlier comments on 'separable'.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which 
&gt; is typical of
&gt; &gt;computer programs or idealized approximations to physical 
&gt; processes, changes
&gt; &gt;occur in discrete steps called events, which are interleaved 
&gt; with periods of
&gt; &gt;inactivity called states.")
&gt; 
&gt; This is a neat idea, but very hard to get right. The problem is to 
&gt; say just what a period of inactivity is. That seems obvious until you 
&gt; try to axiomatize it. For example, consider someone who falls asleep 
&gt; while leaning on a door, thereby preventing the door from opening. In 
&gt; a sense he isnt doing anything, just being there in an inactive 
&gt; state; but if someone is trying to open the door, he IS doing 
&gt; something: he is preventing them opening the door. (Under the right 
&gt; surrounding circumstances he could be accused of negligent homicide.) 
&gt; In computers we do have a fairly clear criterion for this notion of 
&gt; 'inactivity', but computers are carefully crafted to make that 
&gt; possible. On the other hand, there are plenty of examples of physical 
&gt; processes which are best described as discrete, eg the motion of a 
&gt; shuttle in a loom, or the action of a valve tappet; but these are not 
&gt; interleaved with complete inactivity.

MW: We have found this somewhat problematic. We have a rather broad view of
what a state is, which interestingly includes activities. So a state for us
is any piece of space time where the time dimension is non-zero (though it
may be vanishingly small). The useful ones are those for which some
predicate is true, e.g. being a person, being at 20C, being a husband, being
a football match etc. Some states are a temporal part of others. So being a
husband is a temporal part of being a person. Being a quarterback in a
particular footbal match is a temporal part of the football match AND a
temporal part of a person.

MW: It really is possible to represent accurately quite complex ideas with
some very simple basic concepts - but this is what 4D is all about.

MW: Oh the changes (timeless events) are the temporal boundaries of states.
They are when a state starts or stops. Generally we think of activities as
causing events, at some level.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals.  
&gt; This is the root
&gt; &gt;node of the ontology.")

MW: How can this be? If it is only the class of individuals, what are
classes a member of? If classes are a member of something else, then this is
not the root of the ontology.

MW: If the ontology has a root (and I would certainly suggest it should
have) then it needs to be the class of all things (individuals, relations,
classes, and anything else you have).

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation HomogeneousObject "A ContinuousObject in 
&gt; which every part is
&gt; &gt;similar to every other in every relevant respect, e.g., temperature,
&gt; &gt;chemical constitution, density, etc.  An example would be a 
&gt; beaker of pure
&gt; &gt;distilled water in a controlled environment.")
&gt; 
&gt; This depends crucially on what you consider to be a 'relevant' 
&gt; aspect. See later comments on variableObject.

MW: Homogeneous is another relative term, like continuous. It is convenient
to consider something homogeneous for some purpose (usually to make an
approximation). Issues of scale arise again. It is not fundamentally what
something is.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Individual "An entity that can be 
&gt; characterized independently
&gt; &gt;of any relationships it may have to other entities.")

MW: This definition could apply to classes as much as individuals.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation KineticForm "Includes the information in a 
&gt; reel of motion
&gt; &gt;picture film or the patterns and equations for generating 
&gt; motion in virtual
&gt; &gt;reality.")
&gt; 
&gt; See comments on 'script' later.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Object "A Physical Continuant which retains 
&gt; its identity over
&gt; &gt;some interval of time. Although no physical entity is ever 
&gt; permanent, an
&gt; &gt;object can have stable properties over its lifespan. The type Object
&gt; &gt;includes ordinary physical objects as well as the 
&gt; instantiations of classes
&gt; &gt;in object-oriented programming languages.")
&gt; 
&gt; That last sentence is in direct opposition to the notion that 
&gt; datastructures are 'arrangements' (see above), since in that case 
&gt; they are not physical objects. You can't have it both ways. (I think 
&gt; this an extremely silly idea, and amounts to basing a primary 
&gt; ontological classification on a simple pun. It would be like claiming 
&gt; that subatomic particles should be classified with fruit because they 
&gt; both have colors.)

MW: This gives two definitions of object. One as a physical object, one as
an instance of a class (which can be a class and hence not a physical
object). These are two different concepts. You either need to use name
spaces, or different names for these concepts.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a 
&gt; stable identity
&gt; &gt;during any interval of time. Formally, Occurrent satisfies 
&gt; the following
&gt; &gt;conditions:
&gt; &gt;   * The temporal parts of an occurrent exist at different times.
&gt; &gt;   * The spatial parts of an occurrent may exist at the same 
&gt; time, but an
&gt; &gt;occurrent may have 	different spatial parts at different times
&gt; &gt;   * There are no identity conditions that can be used to 
&gt; identify two
&gt; &gt;occurrents that are 	observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions.
&gt; &gt;A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different 
&gt; stages of a
&gt; &gt;life cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant, 
&gt; such as the
&gt; &gt;person's fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable 
&gt; identity conditions
&gt; &gt;at each stage. Even then, the identification depends on an 
&gt; inference that
&gt; &gt;presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")
&gt; 
&gt; The above is highly incoherent. I will just make a few 
&gt; obvious comments.
&gt; 1. the temporal parts of ANYTHING exist at different times, by 
&gt; definition of 'temporal part'. (What you ought to have said is that 
&gt; occurrents HAVE temporal parts, in contrast to continuants.)
&gt; 2. A continuant can also have different spatial parts at different 
&gt; times: your body, for example, renews itself almost completely during 
&gt; an average year.
&gt; 3. There ARE identity conditions which can be used to identify 
&gt; occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping spacetime regions. For 
&gt; example, one can identify the two halves of a soccer match.
&gt; 4. Or, to take the other example, one CAN recognize two different 
&gt; stages in someone's life. And, contrary to Aristotle and his 
&gt; followers, this does NOT always require that a continuant be 
&gt; identified 'at each stage'. That might indeed be a sound basis for 
&gt; legal rules of evidence, but it is not a philosophical requirement. 
&gt; The basic identity condition for being two stages of one life are 
&gt; that there is a life of which the stages are stages, and that is all. 
&gt; Whether this 'life' is a continuant or an occurrent is irrelevant to 
&gt; the basic rule of identity.  Now, how one *recognizes* this identity 
&gt; is another matter, and a potentially very complicated one, requiring 
&gt; a detailed analysis of what it takes to perform an act of recognition 
&gt; and many other arcane and complex issues in psychology: but this is 
&gt; all COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to ontological classification.

MW: I agree.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation OrganicObject "A CorpuscularObject such as a 
&gt; tree or flower
&gt; &gt;that has parts that are not completely separable, even 
&gt; though there are
&gt; &gt;discontinuities.")
&gt; 
&gt; Being organic is simply a matter of how well-connected your parts are 
&gt; to one another? It has nothing to do with carbon-based chemistry, or 
&gt; an elan vital, or nothing like that at all?

MW: Quite.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Physical "An entity that has a location in 
&gt; space-time.")
&gt; 
&gt; A technical question: do spaces and times themselves have a location 
&gt; in spacetime? (My own preference is to say not, but Cyc takes a 
&gt; different view. But either way, we need a clear answer to avoid 
&gt; rapidly descending into muddled axioms.)

MW: Interstingly we see spaces and times as having a location in space time.
So a point in time is a plane through all space at a point in time (to keep
square with relativity, you have to add from some viewpoint - for which the
Earth is convenient). Similarly, a space is a 4D solid of some space for all
time (again relative to what is important). Things like 3pm, or January, or
sphere, are classes of time or shape.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent 
&gt; specification of
&gt; &gt;actions and events: including: computer programs, 
&gt; finite-state machines,
&gt; &gt;Petri nets, robot commands, cooking recipes, musical scores, 
&gt; conference
&gt; &gt;schedules, driving directions, and the scripts of actions 
&gt; and dialog in
&gt; &gt;plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent 
&gt; a dynamic
&gt; &gt;process, it may have static parts.  In a movie film, for example, the
&gt; &gt;sequence of images is a script that determines the motion, 
&gt; but each frame is
&gt; &gt;a schema of a static image.")
&gt; 
&gt; See comments below on 'schema' and 'script'. Also this list is very 
&gt; confusing, since some of the things in it are linguistic in nature 
&gt; (computer programs), others are mathematical abstractions (Petri 
&gt; nets) and others are physical (musical scores and movie film). In 
&gt; what sense is a movie film a 'specification' ?

MW: Agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Process "A Physical Occurrent during the interval of
&gt; &gt;interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail, 
&gt; the same actual
&gt; &gt;entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic 
&gt; process. Even an entity
&gt; &gt;as stable as a diamond could be considered a process when 
&gt; viewed over a long
&gt; &gt;time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")
&gt; 
&gt; Quite. So there is no useful categorical distinction to be 
&gt; made, as I suggest.
&gt; (BTW, what is the 'interval of interest', exactly?)

MW: agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In 
&gt; logic, the assertion
&gt; &gt;of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds 
&gt; to some aspect
&gt; &gt;or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an 
&gt; example, the
&gt; &gt;statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat 
&gt; characterizes the
&gt; &gt;entity named Yojo.")
&gt; 
&gt; This doesnt seem to distinguish the sentence from the proposition 
&gt; expressed by that sentence. Exactly what a proposition is, is a 
&gt; matter of controversy, but in at least one view, it isnt anything at 
&gt; all like a sentence. BTW, what exactly is the word "Cat" supposed to 
&gt; indicate in that last sentence?

MW: Why is this a subclass of assembly? Propositions would appear to be
abstract. I expect things that are assembled to be things I can touch.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some 
&gt; other entity.")
&gt; 
&gt; ? The relation is an entity in a relationship to some other entity? 
&gt; So if (R a b), R is not the relation, but a and b are? This is just 
&gt; nonsense.

MW: Quite. I would be inclined to say "A class of tuples", but in KIF the
relation stands as a predicate, and I have never quite got to the bottom of
whether predicate and class are synonyms (for which I find as yet no
contrary evidence).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Schema "An Abstract form that has the structure of a
&gt; &gt;Continuant and, thus, does not specify time or timelike 
&gt; relationships.
&gt; &gt;Examples include geometric forms, the syntactic structures 
&gt; of sentences in
&gt; &gt;some language, or the encodings of pictures in a multimedia system.")

MW: These for me would be classes that have axioms that define the
relationship between components of members of those classes. There is quite
a lot of analysis to doto get to the bottom of many of these examples.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Script "An Abstract form that has the structure of an
&gt; &gt;Occurrent and, thus, represents time sequences.

MW: Again, this is just some class of activity whose members have components
that are arranged in a particular 4D pattern.

&gt; 
&gt; Both of these (and 'kineticForm') are muddled ideas. They confuse the 
&gt; structure of the form with the structure of what the form describes. 
&gt; First, as noted earlier, abstract forms simply do not (cannot) have 
&gt; spatiotemporal properties such as being continuants or occurrents; 
&gt; but even if we were to somehow allow them to have such aspects, there 
&gt; is no connection between the structure of the form and the structure 
&gt; of what the form describes.  We are all intimately familiar with 
&gt; various notations which give spatial renderings of temporal 
&gt; relationships, and many of us have seen temporal representations of 
&gt; spatial relationships (a slow pan in a movie, for example). More 
&gt; acutely, there are many, many abstractions throughout mathematics 
&gt; which are entirely neutral as to the spatial or temporal aspects of 
&gt; their interpretation. The widespread Allen algebra of timeintervals 
&gt; for example is in fact a theory of intervals, and can be applied to 
&gt; spatial intervals just as well as to temporal ones.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Examples include computer
&gt; &gt;programs, a recipe for baking a cake, a sheet of music to be 
&gt; played on a
&gt; &gt;piano, or a differential equation that governs the evolution 
&gt; of a physical
&gt; &gt;process. A movie can be described by several different kinds 
&gt; of scripts: the
&gt; &gt;first is a specification of the actions and dialog to be acted out by
&gt; &gt;humans; but the sequence of frames in a reel of film is also 
&gt; a script that
&gt; &gt;determines a process carried out by a projector that 
&gt; generates flickering
&gt; &gt;images on a screen.")
&gt; 
&gt; A movie film, it seems, is many things at once. It is a continuant 
&gt; which is also a procedure which is also a script.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Sign "A Sign is considered as representing 
&gt; something to some
&gt; &gt;agent.")
&gt; 
&gt; Just a quibble, but I think that it might be more use to characterise 
&gt; a sign as something intended by one agent to represent something for 
&gt; another agent (or agents). People often find meaning in things that 
&gt; arent usually categorised as signs (except in a metaphorical sense), 
&gt; cf. many folk sayings about smoke and fire.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation Situation "A Relational entity considered as 
&gt; an Occurrent. A
&gt; &gt;situation relates the participants in some process, whose 
&gt; stages may involve
&gt; &gt;different participants at different times.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(documentation Structure "A Relational entity considered as 
&gt; a Continuant. A
&gt; &gt;structure relates multiple objects whose connections constitute the
&gt; &gt;structure.")
&gt; 
&gt; Both the above are clumsy because of the awkwardness of the 
&gt; occurrent/continuant contrast. Rainstorms have a dynamic structure, 
&gt; for example, and cells (in biology) are structures which consist of 
&gt; interlocking processes. The very idea of 'dynamic equilibrium' 
&gt; couldnt be considered in this overly simplistic ontological 
&gt; classification.

MW: Quite.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;(documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject that 
&gt; nonetheless varies
&gt; &gt;in, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, etc.  
&gt; An example
&gt; &gt;would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")
&gt; 
&gt; Consider a homogenous object which has the same chemical consituency, 
&gt; temperature, etc., throughout; like a cube of pure gold. It is as 
&gt; unVariable as one could possibly achieve, let us suppose. 
&gt; Nevertheless, it does vary in some ways. Parts of it, for example, 
&gt; are further north than other parts, and again, some parts of it are 
&gt; higher in the gravity field than other parts. So its parts can be 
&gt; distinguished from each other. Now, is it therefore a VariableObject? 
&gt; I suspect you will want to say not, but on what basis? You cannot 
&gt; claim that *every* property of all its parts are shared by all its 
&gt; other parts. What I suspect you want to say is that all its parts 
&gt; have the same *intrinsic* properties, maybe, or maybe the same 
&gt; *physical* properties. Or maybe you could say that the object is made 
&gt; of the same *stuff* throughout. But in any case, you do need to say 
&gt; what it is you actually do mean.

MW: And this is true of an ocean as much as a bar of gold anyway. This is
again a distinction based on perception and scale, rather than what
something is.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;3.  The third proposed change is to eliminate the axioms of 
&gt; the "Theory of
&gt; &gt;Holes".  As I see it, these axioms are very interesting, but 
&gt; they are also
&gt; &gt;controversial and probably more relevant in a philosophical 
&gt; context than an
&gt; &gt;engineering one like the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, engineering is largely concerned with holes, as a matter of 
&gt; fact (see any history of machine tools: all the great manufacturing 
&gt; advances were based on new ways to remove metal, usually so as to 
&gt; make holes with greater precision. Modern auto manufacturing began 
&gt; with the centerless precision grinder. ) So we will almost certainly 
&gt; need *some* ontology of holes. In fact, I think that this is likely 
&gt; to be a lot more use to engineering than all that stuff about scripts 
&gt; and situations and signs.

MW: Yes (with my engineers hat on) What would a pipe be without the hole in
the middle?
