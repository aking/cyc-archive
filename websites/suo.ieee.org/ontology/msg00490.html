Dear Martin,

An aspect I think you are missing below is the distinction between what
exists in the real world, and a representation of it in a database or
knowledge base. I infer that in all cases below you are refering to
representations.

Regards

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree John Sowa's suggestion is a good one.  The words Relation and
&gt; Relationship have been used in different contexts by 
&gt; different people which
&gt; make it quite clear they are attaching incompatible meanings. 
&gt;  For example,
&gt; many of the contexts in which Matthew West has used Relation are not
&gt; compatible with Ted Codd's definition.   To eliminate these 
&gt; conflicting
&gt; uses sufficiently will probably require more detail than John 
&gt; gave, and
&gt; comment on several of the responses.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have time now to treat the subject to this depth, but 
&gt; I will just
&gt; comment on the suggestion that Relation and Relationship are 
&gt; synonymous.  I
&gt; disagree with John Velman that John Sowa's discussion supports the
&gt; conclusion that they are synonymous.  I recommend strongly that we do
&gt; distinguish them (which I know from long past experience may be
&gt; particularly difficult for French speakers because that 
&gt; language only has
&gt; the word Relation but not Relationship).  I suggest there are at least
&gt; three importantly different (but closely related!) concepts 
&gt; we may wish to
&gt; refer to at different times:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. A generic relationship concept (e.g. Customer), sometimes called
&gt; relationship type
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A specific instance of a relationship concept (e.g. Martin 
&gt; King is a
&gt; customer of Singapore Airlines)
&gt; 
&gt; 3. A population of relationship instances (e.g. all customers 
&gt; of Singapore
&gt; Airlines), close to the concept of class
&gt; 
&gt; I believe Ted Codd's use of Relation clearly corresponds with 3.  In
&gt; natural language, Relationship often means 1. and often means 
&gt; 2. and most
&gt; of the time it is so obvious from the context which it means, 
&gt; that neither
&gt; the utterer nor the interpreter realises there is any 
&gt; potential ambiguity.
&gt; In natural language it is possible to choose to always 
&gt; qualify Relationship
&gt; as Relationship type or Relationship instance, but this gets 
&gt; so clumsy most
&gt; of the time we don't.  Only when we get into more precise 
&gt; languages do we
&gt; find the problem and struggle to resolve it.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line is I recommend we use Relation as Ted Codd and John Sowa
&gt; suggest, and Relationship for 1. and 2., defining qualified 
&gt; terms if we
&gt; find this essential.  French and English both have the word 
&gt; Association,
&gt; which I find a very acceptable synonym for Relationship; this 
&gt; may assist
&gt; some French speakers.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; John's suggestion is a good one.    However, whether
&gt; "relation" and "relationship" are to be synonymous seems to
&gt; be left open.    It seems to me that we should read them
&gt; synonymously (a conclusion based both on John's discussion and
&gt; my prior vunderstanding).  As WordWeb says:
&gt; 
&gt; "('relationship' is often used where 'relation' would serve 
&gt; (as in "the
&gt; relationship between inflation and unemployment")) preferred usage
&gt; of 'relationship' is for human relations or states of relatedness."
&gt; 
&gt;  It seems that in logic, math, and database talk we often use
&gt; "relationship" where "relation" would serve just to make our 
&gt; prose less
&gt; boring.
&gt; 
&gt; Another issue that was raised in the prior correspondence
&gt; is the question of "what is a  predicate (or relation)" versus what is
&gt; an entity or thing.   There was some discussion of reification earlier
&gt; (that I didn't read because...).      I don't know a simple way to
&gt; explain this --- as a mathematician (or at least a former 
&gt; mathematician)
&gt; I don't think I need a 'real' explanation, just some rules to operate
&gt; by.   Nonetheless, when converting natural language statements into
&gt; FOL, there can be a lot of confusion, and more than one way to do it.
&gt; The fact that many predicates and events have names that are
&gt; related in natural language makes  explaining the difference more
&gt; difficult.     For example,  (at least in one possible 
&gt; ontology )   "wet"
&gt; (as in "the street is wet from the rain") is a predicate, while
&gt; "the wetting of the street" describes a "wetting" event whose
&gt; "patient" is "the street", That is, "wetting" is  a thing, 
&gt; while "wet" is
&gt; a predicate.   (Yes, it was raining when I drove to work this 
&gt; morning.)
&gt; 
&gt; I recently read a paper on deontic logic that made significant use of
&gt; mapping back and forth between the domain of quantification 
&gt; (the wetting
&gt; of the street) and the available predicates (the wetness of 
&gt; the street),
&gt; but,
&gt; unfortunately, I can't find the reference right now.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Graham and Pat,
&gt; 
&gt; To avoid endless problems caused by mismatched definitions,
&gt; I suggest that we adopt the following equivalences between
&gt; terms:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. The terms "relation" and "relationship" in ordinary
&gt;     English have multiple meanings.  But the use in both
&gt;     symbolic logic and in relational databases is firmly
&gt;     established.  I recommend that we restrict all uses
&gt;     of those two words to the meanings in logic and RDBMS.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. In RDB, a relation is defined by a table.  The number
&gt;     of columns in the table is critical:  a binary or dyadic
&gt;     relation has two columns, a ternary or triadic relation
&gt;     has three columns, etc.  Each row of the table is
&gt;     called a tuple or a relationship.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. In ordinary language, a relationship (row of a table)
&gt;     normally relates two or more entities.  But for generality,
&gt;     it is convenient to allow tables with just one column.
&gt;     To avoid saying that a one-column table defines a relation,
&gt;     some people prefer to call them properties or attributes.
&gt; 
&gt;  4. In logic, the terms predicate and relation are normally
&gt;     used as synonyms.  For those people who feel uneasy about
&gt;     calling a one-column table a relation, one could say that
&gt;     it defines a monadic or unary predicate.  Then the term
&gt;     predicate can be used to represent tables with 1 or more
&gt;     columns.
&gt; 
&gt;  5. The terms property and attribute tend to get very confusing
&gt;     and people keep arguing about whether attributes are
&gt;     entities.  To avoid such arguments, it is best to use a
&gt;     single word such as predicate, with an additional adjective
&gt;     to specify the number of arguments:  monadic, dyadic,
&gt;     triadic, or n-adic, if you count in Greek; or unary,
&gt;     binary, ternary, or n-ary, if you count in Latin.
&gt; 
&gt; Many people have different preferences in their use of
&gt; terminology, and I don't want to limit anybody's stylistic
&gt; preferences.  But for ease of communication, I would recommend
&gt; that we use the word "predicate" with a qualifier to specify
&gt; the number of arguments as the base term.  To visualize the
&gt; values of a predicate, you can think of it as a table in an
&gt; RDBMS (but with the option of having infinitely many rows, in
&gt; the case of predicates defined over the integers or even the
&gt; real numbers).
&gt; 
&gt; The words "property" and "attribute" have been used in many
&gt; confusing ways.  I suggest that we use them only as synonyms
&gt; for monadic (or unary) predicate.
