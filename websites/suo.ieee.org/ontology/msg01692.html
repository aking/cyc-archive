&gt; &gt; Hopefully not to muddy the water too much further,
&gt; &gt; I'd like to bring to the group's attention two
&gt; &gt; additional perspectives on situations, processes,
&gt; &gt; etc., to see if anyone has any comments about how
&gt; &gt; they relate to approaches already discussed --
&gt; &gt; perhaps they are subsumed, or considered irrelevant,
&gt; &gt; invalid, etc., though to me they each seem to have
&gt; &gt; some merit -- in any case, I'd be very interested
&gt; &gt; in anyone's insights.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The first is the approach presented by Robert C. Moore:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | We really need to say little more than
&gt; &gt; | (1) that situations are part of the causal order
&gt; &gt; | of the world rather than an abstraction of it, and
&gt; &gt; | (2) that situations are in one-to-one correspondence
&gt; &gt; | with true propositions. ... a situation is a piece of
&gt; &gt; | reality that consists of an n-tuple of entities having
&gt; &gt; | an n-ary property or relation ... a proposition is simply
&gt; &gt; | an abstraction of a situation ... a true proposition is one
&gt; &gt; | that is the abstraction of an actual situation.
&gt; &gt; | -- Robert C. Moore, "Logic and Representation",
&gt; &gt; | Moore, CSLI Publications, Stanford, p. 164-5.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Moore then suggests that an event should be considered as consisting
&gt; &gt; of a set of interrelated situations happening over some time period.
&gt; &gt; Thus the motion of an object from A to B over a time period consists
&gt; &gt; of a collection of situations where the object is located at different
&gt; &gt; points at different times.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The second perspective is presented by the linguist Bernard Comrie:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | ... a situation may be either a state, or an event, or a process.
&gt; &gt; | states are static, i.e. continue as before unless changed, whereas
&gt; &gt; | events and processes are dynamic, i.e. require a continual input of
&gt; &gt; | energy if they are not to come to an end; events are dynamic situations
&gt; &gt; | viewed as a complete whole (perfectively), whereas processes are dynamic
&gt; &gt; | situations viewed in progress, from within (imperfectively).
&gt; &gt; | -- Bernard Comrie (1976), "Aspect: An Introduction to the Study of
&gt; &gt; | Verbal Aspect and Related Problems", Cambridge University Press, p. 13.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Richard K. Harrison's website on artificial natural languages
&gt; &gt; gives a summary of Comrie's analysis of aspect and tense:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | In the sentence 'she was singing when I entered', the verb 'entered'
&gt; &gt; | presents its action as a single event with its beginning, middle, and
&gt; &gt; | end included;  this is an example of the perfective aspect.  The verb
&gt; &gt; | 'was singing', on the other hand, refers to an internal portion of her
&gt; &gt; | singing, without any reference to the beginning or end of her singing;
&gt; &gt; | this is an example of imperfective aspect.  In other words, the perfective
&gt; &gt; | treats a situation as a single shapeless whole, similar to the concept of
&gt; &gt; | a 'point' in geometry, while the imperfective looks at the situation from the
&gt; &gt; | inside out and admits the possibility that the situation has a temporal shape.
&gt; &gt; | 'Situation' refers to anything that can be expressed by a verb:  a 'state'
&gt; &gt; | (a static situation that will remain the same unless something changes it),
&gt; &gt; | an 'event' (a dynamic situation considered as a complete, single item) or
&gt; &gt; | a 'process' (a series of dynamic transactions viewed in progress).

&gt; Phil,
&gt; 
&gt; It would be such a joy if some of these folks would
&gt; just go visit their local campus bookstore, pick up
&gt; a math, stat, physics, engin, ops-research text and
&gt; read a few definitions of "event", "process", "state",
&gt; and so on, the sort of stuff that people have slaved
&gt; away at for umpteen generations to achieve even a bit
&gt; of clarity about, before they start cooking up their
&gt; own melanges and meringues of commonsense notions --
&gt; not that they would have to stick to the conventions,
&gt; heaven knows how gulity I am on that score! -- but
&gt; at least they would be able to provide some hint of
&gt; awareness as to why they chose their particular form
&gt; of deviance.
&gt; 
&gt; Just for instance:  If we want probability-&amp;-statistics-minded
&gt; people to keep talking to us, we should be aware that they use
&gt; the word "event" to refer, not to an isolated happening, which
&gt; they call an "instance", "occurrence", or "outcome", as in the
&gt; sample space &lt;Omega&gt;, but to a whole class, collection, or set
&gt; of such occurrences -- but more importantly we should be aware
&gt; of the reasons for this usage, to wit, that what is happening
&gt; is known as anything definite only insofar as it haps to find
&gt; itself depicted, and it is only in the most ideally fictional
&gt; case that its depiction contains enough information to pin it
&gt; down to the "individual" instance, the "isolated" occurrence,
&gt; or the "point" outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been assured once or twice already
&gt; that everybody understands this already.
&gt; Alright already.  Still, I wonder.

Phil,

I wrote that last comment in a bit of a rush, and probably should
have waited until I had the time, and the wits, to mince my words
just a little more finely -- it is something of a sore point with
me, precisely because I would like so much to see any progress on
these questions before I loose these surly bonds, whenever I find
people not taking the trouble to fully exploit the few good ideas
that other people have been blessed with the luck, the skill, and
given their lives to pass on to us.  So when we come to questions
of "process", and the whole host of conceptions that are gathered
around it, like 'event', 'instant', 'instantaneous description",
'occurrence', 'outcome', 'point', 'position', 'proposition', 
'reference frame', 'relation', 'relativity', 'situation',
'state', 'time', and so on, and so forth, all which have
a considerable history that we ought to consider before
we go about repeating the same old mistakes in the name
of some illusion of creativity -- well, like I said, it
is a bit of a sore point with me, and especially because
I think that there is still plenty of room for things that
would be new under this tyred old sun that we hallow as Apollo.

So, in the name of some illusion of creativity, I will arrogate
to change the title, in the hopes that I might remind myself to
try to say something more positive, more constructive, and that
could only be, for my part, to emphasize a position that I have
been trying to make since I first washed up on these SUO shores.
Therefore, let me strive to highlight the focus of my "insight",
if such it be, by essaying a new essay toward a maximally pithy
saying, to wit, this maxim:

| Given a language that is pretty good
| at describing the states of anything,
| a pretty good start in the direction
| of depicting its changes lies in the
| language's "differential extensions".

I will try to explain this maxim later on --
not to say that I've been doing much else,
but never mind all that now, I am nothing
if not Peirce-istent, when I decide to be.

Jon Awbrey
