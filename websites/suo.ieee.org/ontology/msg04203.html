no revelation required, bill.  it's called doing your homework.
i did my homework in set theory and topology many years ago.
anybody else who had done the analogous work in sumo would
have been able to answer my questions in a routine manner
without even hardly thinking about it.  it's the sort of
thing that any reviewer of a paper would ask, the sort
of thing that anyone proposing a standard for others
should be happy to answer.  the next time that you
have a paper come back with comments, try telling
the reviewers to &quot;put up or shut up&quot;, try asking
them to write for you the paper that you should
have written.  let me know how that works out.
and yet that is the kind of snappy comeback
that we get from the sumo team every time
we take the time to review their proposal.
what i see is a lot of people who are
happy to dish out criticism but who
are incapable of taking it, and do
everything they can behind the
scenes to prevent it from
being heard.

&gt; &gt; So go ahead and call yourself an &quot;Ontological Knowledge Engineer&quot;,
&gt; &gt; print up those business cards, attach the prefixes &quot;ontology of this&quot;
&gt; &gt; or &quot;mereo-that&quot; to every subject in sight as a way of wiping it clean
&gt; &gt; of all the work that has gone before and claiming it for your own to
&gt; &gt; start over from scratch -- what does it it matter if mereo-topology
&gt; &gt; looks like a cartoon version of the state of topology 250 yrs ago?
&gt; &gt; Just don't go saying that stuff in front of people who really
&gt; &gt; engineer the knowledge, the hard way, if you are not prepared
&gt; &gt; for a lot of laughing, and not up their sleeves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And this is thanks I get for trying to save you that embarrassent.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, Jon...
&gt; 
&gt; At least I'm capable of being embarrassed.  Comes with the territory when
&gt; one realizes that one doesn't know everything.  It is through such things
&gt; that one grows and learns.
&gt; 
&gt; And as far as your background is concerned, I would not be so quick
&gt; to judge others in that they have not had the magically enlightening
&gt; experiences you have had.  Your background and mine are more similar
&gt; than you think.  And the same is true of many others on this list --
&gt; you do not own the magic key to the truth any more than the rest of
&gt; us do.  The difference is I and others are humble enough to admit
&gt; this and you are not.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, who is it that is saying &quot;ontology of this&quot; and &quot;mereo-that&quot;,
&gt; wiping what has been done before away and claiming the work as one's
&gt; own?  That's a serious charge, don't you think?  Shouldn't you name the
&gt; individuals you are accusing of such behavior and provide evidence that
&gt; they are doing so?
&gt; 
&gt; So again, I repeat what I have said many times before on this list --
&gt; it is incumbent upon you to &quot;put up or shut up&quot;.  Anyone with as much
&gt; insight as you claim into the real nature of things should be capable
&gt; of miraculous deeds.  Let's see them.  Of course nobody can make you
&gt; either put up or shut up, but then again, nobody has to listen to you.
&gt; That's what /dev/null is for.
