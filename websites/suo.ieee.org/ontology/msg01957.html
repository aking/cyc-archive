&gt; &gt; every time I read the words "predicate" and "proposition" I hear
&gt; &gt; them shouting "spoken before" and "placed before", respectively,
&gt; &gt; each of which literally screams "syntactic entity ahead" to me
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but those words were not intended to be read literally,
&gt; even in Latin.  A predicate, like a category, is an accusation
&gt; asserted in a court of law, and a proposition is similarly
&gt; posited before the learned assembly as something to consider.
&gt; I would claim that the court or the learned assembly would be
&gt; more concerned with its meaning (intension) than its syntax.

Yes, those are precisely the other readings that I had in mind.
But those were just (or unjust) Latin translations of the prior
Greek terms -- I do not have the time to dig out my 'Analytics'
and 'Categories' right now, but I do recall that Aristotle used
two different words and schemata here -- hyparcho?  hypokeimai? --
oh, what the heck, what else do I have to do today!? ...

| or found as its parts are contained in a whole;  I mean that it cannot exist as
| apart from the subject referred to.
|
| Aristotle, 'Categories', 2, page 15.

| asserted ('hypokeimenou').
|

|
| Aristotle, 'Prior Analytics', 1.2, page 203.

Anyway, when Aristotle got around to using schematic symbols, the
premisses would be written in either one of two fashions, but most
often, I believe, as "AB" for what we barbarians now write "B=&gt;A".

So, the predicate ('kategoria') in this modal (most common)
scheme is quite literally "written before" the subject term.
Now, I do not know the whole history here, nor am I likely,
soon or ever, to be in receipt of the complete information,
but that "Just So Story" about putting a proposition before
a court or a public assembly sounds a little bit to my ears
like a later Latin folk etymology, or even a Roman lawyers' 
post hoc rationalization.  Just my guess.

&gt; Re proposition as "meaning of a sentence":
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and I am just not sure how you mean it,
&gt; &gt; as you appear to have yet again shifted
&gt; &gt; from using it for a thing in a sign role
&gt; &gt; to using it for a thing in an object role.
&gt; &gt; All in all, over time, I cannot tell which.
&gt; 
&gt; But that is one of Peirce's points:  signs can be used
&gt; at every node of the triad.  In his various enumerations,
&gt; he had thousands of different ways in which signs could
&gt; be related to other signs.

Not the issue here.  It issues from the relational nature
of being a sign, or its interpretant, or its object, that
any thing can potentially be in any one of the O, S, I roles,
and can even be in all of them at once.  In fact, it has always
semed like a very good bet to me, letting the "Whole Universe"
be signified as "WU", that the following triple of the form
&lt;o, s, i&gt; is perfectly plausible:  &lt;WU, WU, WU&gt;  -- thereby
making Daffy Duck the most profound of all our philosophers.

Like I said, not the issue.  The more pertinent question,
from the standpoint of a pragmatic theory of signs is:
"Exactly what roles does the given thing play within
a given moment (= elementary relation = triple) of
the relevant sign relation?"  So, of course, signs
can be objects -- no sooner do we talk about them
than they become objects of discussion, if others
would say "potential objects" (PO's), reserving
the honorific title "object" for the PO of some
consistent style of discussion and predication.

But doing this properly, or without getting totally tongue-tied,
requires the introduction of "higher order" (HO) sign relations.

&gt; I agree, however, that I should clarify
&gt; exactly how I interpret that relation
&gt; between a sentence and a proposition.
&gt; 
&gt; John Sowa

I believe that the general idea of a "meaning-preserving translation" (MPT)
is very important, and it fits in with some of the ideas that I have been
exploring about the "qualitative uses of manifolds" (QUOM's), so I think
that it is not a bad thing to spend some time on it and to get it right.
