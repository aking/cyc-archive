Hi Matthew,

	I think we already have or are in the process of creating the
documents you want.  See my comments below.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear James and Colleagues,
&gt; 
&gt; Let me set out some of the documents (or types of document) I 
&gt; think we need:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Architecture and Principles

How would this differ from the Standard and Purpose of the SUO?

&gt; 
&gt; 2. Languages (KIF)
&gt;     - Requirements
&gt;     - Language Reference Manual
&gt; 

Isn't this embodied in the SUO-KIF reference manual (a work in progress):
<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/suo-kif.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/suo-kif.html</A>

&gt; 3. Methodology for ontology development
&gt;     - Usage of KIF
&gt;     - Ontology Structuring Principles
&gt;     - Ontology Integration Principles and Methodology
&gt;     - Ontology Mapping Principles and Methodology

I've inserted (at the end of this message) my statement of the methodology
regarding merging/aligning ontologies.  Are you saying that we need
something more than this?

&gt; 
&gt; 4. Ontology Parts
&gt;     - A series of parts, each probably quite small 
&gt;       (smaller than the Ian Niles document) that 
&gt;       can be used in groups together for particular
&gt;       purposes.

Actually, the "Merged Ontology" is comprised of nine relatively
self-contained sections, viz. "Structural Ontology", "General Classes and
Axioms", "Agent Hierarchy", "Number Hierarchy", "Units of Measure",
"Organism Hierarchy", "Temporal Definitions/Axioms", "Mereotopological
Definitions/Axioms", and "Positional Relations".  Are you saying that we
need a more fine-grained division that this?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	"As with several other people, I also believe that much

&gt; &gt; a good improvement). Despite this fact, I think this group 
&gt; has to keep
&gt; &gt; working on the "general picture" before focussing on (this or 
&gt; &gt; other) base
&gt; &gt; documents. I understand that concrete results would speed up 
&gt; &gt; the process,
&gt; &gt; but at this early stage I see it as a mistake."

=========================================
Procedure for Merging/Aligning Ontologies
=========================================

The procedure I used in merging aligning ontologies is as follows.  The
first step was to convert all of the ontologies listed on the SUO Candidate
Content web page (<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>) into SUO-KIF.  Once
this was accomplished, I selected the most general ontology (John Sowa's
upper level ontology) as the base ontology.  I then mapped concepts/axioms
from the remaining ontologies into the base ontology.  In this mapping
process, there were two possible cases, each in turn with two subcases.

1.  New content (Nothing in the merged ontology corresponds with the
concept/axiom to be mapped)

  	a. Useful/Relatively Noncontroversial content.  In this subcase, the
new concept/axiom is deemed to 	be useful and not to violate any cherished
philosophical principles.  Once I decided that the new 	concept/axiom should
be included, it was simply a matter of finding a place for it in the
ontology.  	In some cases, this required creating some intermediate
levels of concepts between existing 	concepts and new content.  These
intermediate levels were identified in an earlier email directed 	at
John Sowa on "trouble spots" in the merged ontology.  An example of this
subcase is the 	subhierarchy of numbers that was taken from the KIF-Numbers
ontology on the Ontolingua server. 

	(subclass-of RealNumber Number)
	(subclass-of RationalNumber RealNumber)
	(subclass-of PositiveRealNumber RealNumber)
	(subclass-of NegativeRealNumber RealNumber)
	(subclass-of Integer RationalNumber)
	(subclass-of EvenInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of OddInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of NaturalNumber Integer)
	(subclass-of NonnegativeInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of NegativeInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of PositiveInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of PositiveNumber Number)
	(subclass-of NegativeNumber Number)
	(subclass-of ComplexNumber Number) 

	b. Useless/Controversial content.  In this subcase, the new
concept/axiom is judged (by me) to be 	either not useful or too
controversial for incorporation into a schema that we hope will have both
broad application and wide acceptance.  This is of course a very subjective
judgement, but ontology 	merging/alignment is probably much more of
an art than a science.  An example of content that was 	thought to be too
controversial for inclusion is the following hierarchy of normative notions
developed by myself.  It is too controversial, because there are many ways
of categorizing such 	notions, and some have suggested that a version of
Deontic Logic would be more appropriate for 	capturing the required
connections.

	;; (subclass-of Normative Entity)
	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Normative)
	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Proposition)
	;; (subclass-of Obligation NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of Agreement NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of JudgementOfEtiquette NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of AestheticJudgement NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of InstitutionalObligation Obligation)
	;; (subclass-of PersonalObligation Obligation)
	;; (subclass-of ReligiousObligation InstitutionalObligation)
	;; (subclass-of LegalObligation InstitutionalObligation)

2.  Old Content (There is some degree of overlap between the merged ontology
and the concept/axiom to be     mapped)

	a.  Perfect Overlap.  In this case, the terms may differ but the new
concept has the same semantic 	content as a concept already in the merged
ontology or, with respect to axioms, there is a logical 	equivalence
between the new axiom and an existing axiom.  An example of this sort of
case occurs in 	the various mereotopological theories.  Some philosophers
use 'part-of' as the primitive notion to 	frame their axioms, some use
'overlaps', and still others use some notion of 'connection'.  	However, in
many cases, axioms across these different systems are logically equivalent.

	b.  Partial Overlap.  In this case, there is some overlap in meaning
between the new content and 	existing concepts or axioms in the merged
ontology.  An example of this is the case role hierarchy.  	Although
John Sowa's system of case roles was part of the base ontology (and, hence,
the original 	merged ontology), I tried to simplify it somewhat to make it
more like other systems of case roles.  	Both systems follow:

	John Sowa's Subhierarchy under 'Role':

	;;(subclass-of PrehendingEntity Role)
	;;(subclass-of PrehendedEntity Role)
	;;(subclass-of Composite PrehendingEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendingEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendedEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Component PrehendedEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Whole Composite)
	;;(subclass-of Substrate Composite)
	;;(subclass-of Part Component)
	;;(subclass-of Property Component)
	;;(subclass-of Piece Part)
	;;(subclass-of Participant Part)
	;;(subclass-of Stage Part)
	;;(subclass-of Attribute Property)
	;;(subclass-of Manner Property)
	;;(subclass-of Determinant Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Source Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Product Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Immanent Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Initiator Determinant)
	;;(subclass-of Initiator Source)
	;;(subclass-of Resource Source)
	;;(subclass-of Resource Immanent)
	;;(subclass-of Goal Determinant)
	;;(subclass-of Goal Product)
	;;(subclass-of Essence Product)
	;;(subclass-of Essence Immanent)
	;;(subclass-of Agent Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Recipient Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Beneficiary Recipient)
	;;(subclass-of Completion Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Destination Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Duration Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Effector Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Experiencer Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Instrument Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Location Essence)
	;;(subclass-of Matter Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Medium Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Origin Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Path Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Patient Essence)
	;;(subclass-of PointInTime Essence)
	;;(subclass-of Result Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Start Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Theme Essence)

	The Revised Case Roles (the version that appears in the latest
release of the merged ontology):

	(subclass-of Predicate Role)
	(subclass-of ComponentRelation Predicate)
	(instance-of part-of ComponentRelation)
	(subclass-of component-of part-of)
	(subclass-of external-covering component-of)
	(subclass-of internal-component-of component-of)
	(instance-of property-of ComponentRelation)
	(subclass-of BinaryRelation Predicate)
	(subclass-of TernaryRelation Predicate)
	(subclass-of VariableArityRelation Predicate)
	(subclass-of CaseRole BinaryRelation)
	(subclass-of IntentionalRelation BinaryRelation)
	(subclass-of IntentionalRelation IntentionalEntity)
	(subclass-of PropositionalAttitude IntentionalRelation)
	(subclass-of ObjectAttitude IntentionalRelation) 
	(instance-of stage-of ComponentRelation)
	(subclass-of attribute-of property-of)
	(subclass-of manner-of property-of)
	(instance-of source-of CaseRole)
	(instance-of agent CaseRole)
	(instance-of recipient CaseRole)
	(instance-of beneficiary CaseRole)
	(instance-of completion CaseRole)
	(instance-of destination CaseRole)
	(instance-of duration CaseRole)
	(instance-of effector-of CaseRole)
	(instance-of experiencer CaseRole)
	(instance-of instrument CaseRole)
	(instance-of located-at CaseRole)
	(instance-of matter CaseRole)
	(instance-of medium CaseRole)
	(instance-of origin CaseRole)
	(instance-of path CaseRole)
	(instance-of patient CaseRole)
	(instance-of exists-at CaseRole)
	(instance-of result CaseRole)
	(instance-of theme CaseRole)
