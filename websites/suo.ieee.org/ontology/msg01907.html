<PRE>

It seems to me that the proposal below, with the amendments suggested by
John Sowa, has several advantages:

1) It goes on the record making it clear that SUO is open to actively
considering multiple "working documents" / "expert contributions", etc., at
this time. As Chris Partridge noted in his recent post, this is something
that Jim Schoening had previously written, but I think it is good to get
this issue clearly resolved and established, once and for all.

2) It also provides a way in which a working document can have some degree
of formal acknowledgement and status as being under consideration by SUO,
without having precedence over other working documents. This is different
from what it seemed that Bob Spillers had previously requested, that there
be no "formality" whatsoever attached to the status of something being a
working document. Yet some formality without preeminence may be acceptable
to all.

The only potential disadvantages and/or issues I can see are the following:

A) Does SUO need some kind of "filter" to ensure that not just any document
can be submitted and automatically accepted as a working document / expert
contribution, and thereby gain the patina of preliminary status with IEEE
SUO? For example, suppose there is a "crank" who happens to be reading the
postings of this group, who would like to submit a document that virtually
everyone else would say is outlandish and not worth considering as a working
paper? Even under the additional terms proposed below, if Mr. Crank waits
six months and becomes a voting member, then he can submit a document and
tell the world it has been accepted as a working document by IEEE. One
remedy for this (hopefully unlikely)potential problem is to require that
anything submitted for status as a working document must receive at least a
plurality of votes in favor of acceptance, by voting members of SUO.

B) Separately, Matthew West has raised the question whether anything needs
to be, or merits being, a formal working document at this point. It seems to
me that if the Merged Ontology has the status of a Working Document, yet the
majority of the group either abstained or voted against it, then this
indicates that the Merged Ontology has sufficient limitations that it would
be a good idea at this point to try to get some other contenders recognized
as having at least the same, preliminary status, e.g. EPISTLE, OpenCyc, etc.
In saying this I do not prejudge the Merged Ontology's chances of eventually
being selected as the final SUO standard.

C) We may have multiple working documents, but their relation to the final
SUO standard is completely open, as it should be at this point. The final
standard may be one of these working documents, chosen as best by the group.
Or it may be a "merger" of multiple working documents. Or conceivably it
might be a "metaontology" describing other ontologies. Or it might be some
framework for translating between ontologies, or some kind of "library of
ontologies" or "assembly of ontologies", with references to member
ontologies, etc. Whatever the final standard is, it seems that at some point
it would have to become a working document itself.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Bob,
&gt; 	.	Having looked at the website, and seem the pre-eminent
&gt; status given a "Document being worked on by this Working Group",
&gt; I see valid
&gt; reasons for your concern.
&gt;
&gt; 	.	Naturally, many of us want to encourage Ian Niles, Matthew
&gt; West and Robert Kent, as well as the prospect of somehow including the Cyc
&gt; ontology. However, that doesn't mean any one of them will necessarily turn
&gt; out to be either the core, or even necessarily part, of the final product
&gt; that turns out to have the robust structure we need. I suggest,
&gt; for the best
&gt; product to result from this project, we have to maximise the
&gt; opportunity for
&gt; highest quality, robust and generic ontology to emerge. This requires due
&gt; and balanced consideration be given all candidates, and so pre-eminence is
&gt; not appropriate.
&gt;
&gt; 	.	I have always wondered why there is a need to have a
&gt; pre-eminent document at such an early stage. NONE of us can possibly
&gt; adjudicate, at this stage, which candidate structure will finish
&gt; up with the
&gt; necessary soundness to constitute an appropriate final product.
&gt;
&gt; 	.	As a result I now support your move to remove the formal
&gt; pre-eminent status of any particular product(s).
&gt;
&gt; 	.	Furthermore, I think it is generally agreed that the ballot
&gt; caused a lot of unnecessary acrimony, and was hardly decisive in its
&gt; outcome. I think many feel it shouldn't have occurred at such an
&gt; early stage
&gt; (even Jim acknowledged that). Up to now I was happy to live with
&gt; it, but now
&gt; I see the risk of the current outcome swaying the long-term prospects for
&gt; the project settling on the best final product.
&gt;
&gt; 	.	For these reasons, I support your call for a ballot to
&gt; resolve the contentious situation that evidently exists.
&gt;
&gt; 	.	Personally, I would be happy that such a ballot require a
&gt; 2/3rds majority, since I feel that demonstrates an adequately substantial
&gt; direction of opinion.
&gt;
&gt; 	.	I also support the sort of careful additional considerations
&gt; John has suggested for the motion below. I feel this is an opportunity to
&gt; set up a sound ontology candidacy structure, and such additional controls
&gt; can assist that aim.

&gt;
&gt; Bob,
&gt;
&gt; I like that proposal, and I would vote for it.  But I would suggest two
&gt; clarifications:  (1) decide on some name for the submissions, such as
&gt; "working paper" or "expert contribution"; and (2) clarify the status of
&gt; "member".  Right now, there are three categories of people who have been
&gt; participating:
&gt;
&gt;  1. People who have attained voting rights in the SUO process.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Those who are on the waiting list for voting rights.
&gt;
&gt;  3. Those who have been occasionally reading the messages,
&gt;     occasionally submitting a comment, but not yet sure what
&gt;     level of participation they would like to commit to.
&gt;
&gt; I would suggest that:
&gt; *	Anyone in group #1 should be able to submit such a document and/or
&gt; serve as the technical editor.
&gt; *	Anyone in group #2 could be the technical editor of such a document,
&gt; but would have to get someone in group #1 to submit it.
&gt; *	Anyone in group #3 would have to apply for #2 status and get someone
&gt; in #1 to submit it.
&gt;

&gt; _______________________________________________________________
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Motion:  Request for adoption by general (unanimous) consent.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Resolved: Any member of the IEEE SUO Working Group may post a document
&gt; &gt;to the SUO web page as a "Document being worked on by this Working
&gt; &gt;Group."  The member who posts a document is presumptively the technical
&gt; &gt;editor of the document and by posting agrees to perform this role or
&gt; &gt;alternatively name another member who agrees to perform the role of
&gt; &gt;technical editor.  No vote will be required to post a document or name
&gt; &gt;an editor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The statement  "All documents posted are deemed to have equal status and
&gt; &gt;no document has any preferred position over any other document." will
&gt; &gt;precede the list of documents.
