Dear Pat and Chris,

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - A little something about rationale, approach and 
&gt; choices, e.g. why
&gt; &gt; &gt;  did you introduce @arg,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You mean, why did I introduce row variables?  Well, there's four
&gt; &gt;paragraphs on row variables there, including an explicit 
&gt; semantics for
&gt; &gt;them, but the simple answer is that they give KIF a great deal of
&gt; &gt;additional expressive power (noted at various points in the
&gt; &gt;documentation statements).
&gt; 
&gt; Also, to be fair, Chris didnt *introduce* row variables: they are in 
&gt; the original KIF spec, and all we have done is to provide them with a 
&gt; decent semantics.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why did you stop short of extensional classes?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Because people often talk about classes in a way that does not
&gt; &gt;presuppose extensionality.  Seems to me to be a good methodological
&gt; &gt;principle not to force a relatively simple issue when you 
&gt; don't have to.
&gt; 
&gt; Chris is being slightly disingenuous here. There are actually two 
&gt; distinct issues. First, Chris has a philosophical taste for a 
&gt; non-extensional view of classes and relations. I disagree with him 
&gt; about that. 

MW: Me too, but there are different ways of looking at things.

&gt; But there is another, technical, reason for keeping the 
&gt; relation/extension distinction in the KIF semantics, which is that it 
&gt; provides an elegant semantic mechanism for interpreting a logic with 
&gt; a 'free syntax', in which for example expressions like
&gt; (R R) can be written and are meaningful. 

MW: Sorry, I don't understand what your getting at here. I don't see what
saying (R R) has to do with extensionality or not. Please explain further.

&gt; This is a compelling reason 
&gt; for maintaining the distinction in the logic; particularly as anyone 
&gt; who wishes to assert that relations are to be understood 
&gt; extensionally can say that with a single simple axiom, eg by 
&gt; asserting:
&gt; (=&gt; (forall (@x) (&lt;=&gt; (?rel1 @x)(?rel2 @x)))
&gt;       (= ?rel1 ?rel2))
&gt; ......
MW: I'm struggling with this KIF. It seems to say:

If nothing, for all tuples @x
  (If rel1 @x implies rel2 @x and vice versa)
  then rel1 = rel2

OK that seems to make sense, but I don't get the connection I'm afraid.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm afraid this does not compute with me. I was also 
&gt; not aware of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; demand for this (whose requirement is this? what are 
&gt; the benefits?)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one wants to develop an ontology that embodies 
&gt; a conception
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of time on which the future is not determinate, and 
&gt; hence on which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are past and present objects, but no determinate future
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objects.  (Such a conception might be useful, say, in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manufacturing system that has to calculate on the fly 
&gt; the number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kind of objects it is going to produce during any given run
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depending on demand.)  On such a conception, the class of humans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grows moment by moment with each birth (or conception, 
&gt; or whatever
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your criterion is for being human).  But if classes are 
&gt; extensional,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they don't "grow"; `human' picks out a different class with each
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; birth.  Now, maybe that's ok with you; maybe it's the 
&gt; way it should
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be.  But there are, it seems to me, intuitions that 
&gt; warrant saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that membership in the class of humans can change over time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Extensionality is omitted simply to for allow such a 
&gt; conception of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class.  Add extensionality if you don't like it.
&gt; 
&gt; Chris' view of 'existence', class-membership and time is 
&gt; idiosyncratic and I think woefully confused, and it is not forced on 
&gt; one by non-extensionality or by assuming that the future is 
&gt; indeterminate. And as I said, this isn't the only, or in my view the 
&gt; main, reason why the KIF model theory is the way it is:certainly one 
&gt; should not think of KIF as endorsing these positions.  But his final 
&gt; point is the main one: the logic makes no committment to 
&gt; extensionality one way or the other. It does not assume it, but it 
&gt; also doesn't deny it. The fewer philosophical assumptions imposed by 
&gt; the underlying language, the better.

MW: Yes I agree. But I thought this was already a basic bit of ontology
on top of the language. A rather good bit actually.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: OK - of course one of the benefits of a 4D approach 
&gt; is that all this
&gt; &gt; &gt; comes out in the wash, so extensional classes don't have 
&gt; a problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;At the cost of loss of generality.  Your 4D approach forces 
&gt; a conception
&gt; &gt;of time on which one has to view the future as determinate.
&gt; 
&gt; No, Chris, it doesn't force that conception. The following might be 
&gt; the same misunderstanding, in a different form:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's
&gt; &gt;exactly the kind of decision I don't think should be forced 
&gt; on users in
&gt; &gt;an ontology meant for general use, and I suspect that is likely to be
&gt; &gt;problematic in certain contexts.  Furthermore, your 4D 
&gt; approach doesn't
&gt; &gt;allow for the possibility that there could have been other things --
&gt; &gt;other humans, say -- than the ones that actually exist at 
&gt; some time or
&gt; &gt;other, since, by definition, the class HUMAN comprises just 
&gt; the actual
&gt; &gt;humans.
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn't restrict one to considering only the actual humans. In 
&gt; fact, by providing a uniform notion of 'enclosing' spatiotemporal 
&gt; plenum, it actually elegantly supports an ontology of alternative 
&gt; world-lines. The issues of 4d/3d, and of representing nondeterminate 
&gt; futures or alternative possible worlds, are almost completely 
&gt; orthogonal.

MW: Yes, this is actually the approach I think I have ended up with.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So if you ever need to add modality, your 4D extensional
&gt; &gt;classes are once again likely to be problematic.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe if you wanted to add modality, but that is another issue. Modal 
&gt; languages are not the only way to talk about nondeterminate futures 
&gt; or alternative possiblities.

MW: At some point we should have a discussion about these alternatives
(are they alternatives?) but perhaps not now.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If classes are non-extensional then I presume 
&gt; membership can also
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change over time.  There needs to be something that 
&gt; explains how you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get to the membership at some point in time.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The presumption is unwarranted. There may be many reasons for wishing 
&gt; to have non-extensional classes other than temporal considerations. 
&gt; For one example: it can be argued that since not all sets are 
&gt; classes, 

MW: Can you give an example please? I'm not quite sure what this means.

&gt; there must be something more to a class other than simply 
&gt; the set comprising its extension. (I don't think much of this 
&gt; argument, but I've heard it made.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure I understand the question, but it's 
&gt; irrelevant until
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you add a temporality to the axioms somehow, either by 
&gt; introducing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporal operators and an appropriate extension to the 
&gt; semantics or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an explicit theory of time.  If you do, then presumably 
&gt; you'd have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to add something like a temporal parameter to all predicates,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including instance-of, so that talks instead of being 
&gt; an instance-of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class C *at some time* t.
&gt; 
&gt; You wouldnt HAVE to add such a temporal parameter to relations. That 
&gt; is one way to proceeed, but there are others.

MW: Yes, as I said "something like ..."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: I keep struggling with it, but I know from experience 
&gt; with data
&gt; &gt; &gt; models that languages like this are often missread by 
&gt; non-experts such
&gt; &gt; &gt; as myself.  Also the introducion of (to me) new elements 
&gt; like @args
&gt; &gt; &gt; means I have a new struggle to come to terms with what 
&gt; they mean and
&gt; &gt; &gt; how they can be used.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I devote a fair amount of informal discussion to the semantics of row
&gt; &gt;variables, and state their formal semantics explicitly.  How they are
&gt; &gt;used is illustrated throughout the document.
&gt; 
&gt; We do plan to provide more 'tutorial' material on row variables, 
&gt; however, in future documents. The idea is not actually very hard, but 
&gt; it is sometimes hard to *believe* until one gets used to it. Think 
&gt; about a normal variable ?x as standing for a single term, and a row 
&gt; variable @x as standing for any row of terms, ie something like t1 
&gt; .... tn, except that n might be zero. (Including the zero row is a 
&gt; technical device that makes things work better.)

MW: I'm sure this would be very useful. Though I admit to already getting
used 
to the idea, you probably realise that I am a bit of a missionary, so I
try always to have those outside the current circle in mind so that we
make the barriers to entry as low as possible.
