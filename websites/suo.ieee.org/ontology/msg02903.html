DM:  I do see that you've changed the subject of this thread,
     but I don't think of myself as particularly audacious,
     in this particular discussion.  At this late stage of
     my career, I feel particularly humbled that there is
     apparently something so very fundamental and important
     that I can't get a grasp on.

Oh, my allusion to "Irreducible Audacity" was an echo of two other sources --
in fact, I did not even think to change the subject until after my rather
sudden and late-breaking recognition that the "Dialogue In Nature" (DIN)
was in the offing here, even though this is one my most persistent images
about the nature of communication, and why we even bother to communicate
at all -- and second, though a fainter and more distant inspiration,
is one of my favorite coinages from Matthew West's messages, to wit,
of using the word "adacity" to signify the valency of relations.

DM:  I'm not trying to solve the riddle of the Sphinx, as John Sowa has pointed
     out as one of Peirce's great contributions.  I'm just hoping to facilitate
     better communication among people, particularly in a commercial environment,
     by using conceptual and technological tools to reduce the levels of ambiguity
     that otherwise would exist without that effort.

DM:  I don't know if it helps to dwell on my thoughts, but I'll answer
     your questions below, for what it's worth.  My main goal is not to
     defend what I have written, but to use something that I do understand
     (because I've written it) to come at something I don't understand, from
     the point of view of how this is useful for the purpose I've expressed of
     facilitating clearer and less ambiguous communication.

     *********** Begin sign instance ***********

     Sign:  "rose"

     Referent:
     Imaginary color (expressed in the French language)
     of an imaginary (plastic?) disc, imagined to be used
     as one of number of game pieces in an imaginary game
     of Tower of Hanoi.

JA:  When you say "imaginary color", which aspect of that
     is the most important to you, the color or the image?

DM:  Neither.  What's important is the disc.  But it's also important that this
     is not an actual disc, in the context of a manufacturing process, physics
     experiment, etc., but that it is an image of a disc being used in a thought
     experiment of some kind.

Okay, the disk is an object, too, a sign of which is the word "disk".
Since I have actually played this game, in several isomorphic variants,
I think of the various real objects that I have known at different times.
As it turns out, my favorite game was played with boxes instead of disks,
but I can easily perform the imaginary metamorphosis of one into the other.
Now, I started out talking about properties, merely as an illustration of
some basic issues in the theory of signs, but you are free to change the
subject if you wish -- it's just all the work I would have to do by way
of redrawing what was after all an arbitrary but adequate example that
makes me resist it.

JA:  If you want to talk about the property of a thing
     that we call its color, then I would call this
     property an "object", merely because it is an
     object of discussion and thought, and thus
     an object of the signs that go into this
     process of talking and thinking.

JA:  If you want to talk about the impression of a color
     that we have in our minds, then I would call this
     mental impression an "image", and I would tend to
     treat it, in the first instance, as a type of "sign",
     one that resides or flits through the minds of creatures
     like us -- though, of course, anything at all, even this
     image, becomes an object of discussion and thought as soon
     as anybody talks or thinks about it, like we are now.

DM:  This brings up exactly one of my points of confusion about Peirce.
     You have used the phrase "discussion and thought" a couple of times,
     in a way that seems to want to conflate them.  In an earlier stab at
     understanding sign vs. interpretant, I stated that I thought sign was
     about utterance and interpretant (sign) was about bringing the sign,
     and the object of discussion together in the mind of the interpreter.
     Notice that I didn't say "human mind" just then, nor did I on that
     other occasion, though more than one reader interpreted me to have
     done so.  Before I could correct that impression, a cascade of
     signs washed over the bow.

But this is very typical of the brand of misunderstanding that arises
in a particular sort of discussion and has very little to do with any
peculiar difficulties that might be imagined to affect the subject or
the theory of sign relations.  So let us try to address it in generic
terms.  The problem comes up whenever we have to discuss a subject by
way of examples, based on whatever scattering or smattering of points
we can toss in the ring of discussion to illustrate its circumference,
rather than fully discursively, by painting the ring itself in bright
glowing colors of linguisitic contingencies.  I guess that a familiar
case is provided by a teacher who picks up a piece of chalk and draws
the figure of a triangle on the slate before our eyes, speaking words
to the effect:  "Consider an arbitrary triangle."  Now we know better
than to think that the teacher intends us to contemplate this special
arrangement of chalkdust on the board, nor even a particular abstract
object that has the same exact shape, but that the dust and the image
are intended only to remind us of an abstract object which is insofar
as we know it a triangle and nothing more.

Likewise, in discussing the pure form of a sign relation,
the sort of thing that lies some distance from our human,
all too human imagination, I am 'faute de mieux' obliged
to begin with materiel that is more akin to our concrete,
all too concrete senses and sensibilities.  Consequently,
given our familiarity, intimate if not always reflective
or critical, that we have with the conduction of our own
streams of consciousness and the local motion of our own
trains of thought, our own thinking processes afford the
study of signs in general with an ample and ready supply
of fuel.  But these ample examples never outrun or leave
behind their purely exemplary features, and however well
they do indeed inform the subject, they only inscribe it
from the inner side, and never define its outer boundary.

JA:  Now, I use the word "referent" in conformity
     with a whole user community -- and this is
     an army somewhat larger than the paltry
     platoon of Peirceans -- so take your pick,
     and pay the consequences of doing so.
     (Do as we say -- and nobody will get hurt?)

DM:  I understand about reserved words, and I'm careful to use them carefully
     in reserved contexts.  Which is why, for instance, I can't bring myself
     to use "object" or "interpretant" just now, since I can't seem to get
     them clear enough to make practical use of them in my area of concern.

In the pragmatic theory of signs, the words "object", "sign", "interpretant"
are defined as three roles that things may take up in a 3-adic sign relation.
In extensional terms, they are just the column headings on a specified type
of 3-column data table, one that satisfies the specs of a certain definition.
The guy who set this theory on its merry way did have a certain respect for
ancient traditions, and so the term "object", derived from the typical Latin
translation for the Greek word "pragma", with all of its echoes of "praxis",
was not your average newfangled whim.  (By the way, "newfangled" is as old
as Chaucer, at least).

DM:  Please note that I did not use "pragmatic", for the same reason.
     I like to use that word as a close synonym to practical, which
     does not seem to be the philosophical definition.

It's an old saw of pragmatic thinkers
that the low road and the high road
meet in the end.

Get it?  Pragma = end.

DM:  In any event, I am using "referent" exactly in accordance with the definition
     from my humble Webster, lying close to hand:  "one that is referred to;  esp:
     the thing that a symbol (as a word or sign) stands for" (a definition apparently
     established in 1884).

That's just the army that I had in mind.
Of course, there is a residual ambiguity
that abides in some minds about the scope
of the word "thing", as it is used in this
form of definition.  So it would help me to
know if some of the things that you read this
to be can be activities and properties, or not.

DM:  Sign emitter:  Josiane Caron-Pargue

JA:  It is a popular option to parameterize signs
     by the various sorts of agents that bear them
     in various sorts of ways, where "agent" can mean
     a community, a person, an animal, a machine, a divinity,
     and so on.  I have just sought to transmit to you what
     I consider to be the benefit of my experience, and the
     benefit of what my experience has taught me is a quantum
     of good advice from Peirce, that this particular way of
     doing things will ultimately lead to despair, but then,
     I did not take Peirce's advice either until after I had
     gone out and personally experienced some of this despair.
     So it goes.  At any rate, you may consider the fact that
     the particular role of transmitter or receiver is of
     secondary importance here, since people are always
     talking to themselves as they to talk to others,
     if you catch my drift.

DM:  I'm not sure about this despair.  Again, from a practical point of view,
     I'm not really concerned with how we think, internal dialogs, etc. in
     my own dialog with the SUO study group.  It is my opinion that we can
     make progress on certain practical objectives without resolving whether
     the brain is actually processing signs.  For this purpose, my personal
     preference would be that we should reserve "sign" to mean externalized
     utterance, where utterance is generalized to include verbal, graphic,
     alphabetic, etc.  With a special emphasis on utterance captured and
     transmitted via computer-based networks for the purpose of amplifying
     and directing communication among human beings.

By this "despair" I mean the futility that comes from not being able
to solve the problems that we want to solve, by virtue -- or vice? --
of having chosen the wrong representation for the problem.  It's just
the sort of thing that one usually discovers the hard way, and I have
no desire to see anybody else go through all the pain of that future
futility -- still, I know the probabilities that affect the chances
of any such attempt at communication.  Still, let no one say that
I did not try the best I could, and thus have met my human, all
too human responsibilities.  And, of course, I could be wrong.

DM:  Given this last paragraph, I should also stop using the word "sign"
     on this list, because it clearly has a reserved meaning for some
     that doesn't match the meaning I tend to assign.

Well, it's not like this usage prevails or anything.
And the world is rife with examples where technical
uses of words like "class", "group", "object", "set",
and so on, have to be marked out from ordinary uses.
Somehow we get by, in spite -- by virtue? -- of all
this dastardly dangerous duplicity.

DM:  Purpose:  Illustration of a technique for analyzing
     certain kinds of discourse (??)

JA:  Purpose is good.  But consider this, for a pragmatic thinker
     "purpose" is a synonym for "object", that is, "objective"
     (aim, business, concern, end, goal, intention, interest,
     'pragma').  All of which raises an interesting question:
     What is the relationship of this "big object", that is
     to say, the "big idea", the overall objective that an
     agent is directed toward, to the "bit object", in the
     present case, the property that is being talked or
     thought about at the moment in question?

JA:  In this connection, one of the reasons why 3-adic relations
     are so important is that they are what it takes for you to
     focus on a "little object" without losing track of the
     "big object" of which it forms a part, in other words,
     to put your effort into getting from A to B without
     forgetting that you were doing this order to get
     from A to Z.

DM:  This is what I thought, but it has tended to get obscured
     (in my opinion) in the long debates about reduction of
     triads to dyads.  Maybe to say it another way, an issue
     of communication has tended to get lost in a discussion
     of representation.  I don't know if this is true, it just
     strikes me as possible.

I did not pick this particular battle, but it is necessary to
clear up the confusions that people actually have, and I think
it is necessary, however grueling, because it has to do with
the "mininal adequate resource base" (MARB) that is required
to build models of all sorts of complex processes, including
communication, concept formation, learning, reasoning, and
ontology building -- yes, we build them, they do not come
for free.

DM:  It seems to me that expression of the big object is important
     to provide context for the bit stream, but then would not have
     to be repeated for every bit that is subsequently emitted.
     This, of course, is an oversimplification, since in real
     communication the context continuously emerges as the
     bit stream(s) emerge and interact.

This is remarkable characterization of the "Big Idea To Actualize" (BITA),
and so I will reserve my many forthcoming remarks about it to another time.

But consider this possibility, that there may be no such thing
as the unique universal context that will resolve all dubities.

DM:  Occasion of emission:
     E-mail message on a discussion list of a working group
     of an international standards body, distributed to the
     list on 18 May, 2001.

JA:  You may, of course, add as many additional parameters as you wish.
     But are they necessary to the programme, or merely excess baggage?
     That is, what is the appropriate level of abstraction for what we
     are trying to get at here?

DM:  Again, I'm not aiming at the riddle of the Sphinx here,
     or any grand psychological or philosophical theory.
     Just probing with some blunt prods to see what
     connection I can make with my way of seeing
     the problem.  I'll be so callow as to admit
     that I had hoped to express my concerns in
     six dimensions, so that I could begin the
     thread with the catchier subject line
     "Irreducible Sexadicity".

It was a practical question.

DM:  But, I do think that when a sign is emitted
     is a critical aspect of context.  Just take
     a look back through the Peircean scholarship
     to see how often there are discussions of
     *when* he said what he said, shedding light
     because it was either before or after he said
     something else, in a certain stage of various
     debates with his contemporaries.  In business
     emission of externalized utterance (my ugly
     term for what I really can't mean as "sign"),
     the order and timing of emission is very much
     of the essence of meaning and communication.

Oh, okay, I am not saying that this factor, context of utterance,
is not a factor in communication and interpretation.  I am only
trying to tell you what I worked out about this aspect of the
situation at a younger age, when I was so much sharper than
I am now, and what I eventually discovered, like so many
of my best ideas, to be already written down by Peirce.
And that is just that 3-adic sign relation itself is
the main repository of all the effects of context,
that context is just one of the many factors that
can be conceived to affect what the interpretant,
of a sign with respect to an object, actually is.
In sum, the sign relation itself affords us with
a minimal adequate representation of the data that
we need for any investigation of contextual effects.

DM:  Medium:
     E-mail, including multiple servers,
     software protocols, screen display, etc.

JA:  Ditto.

DM:  Relatively ditto from me back atcha.
     Though not in the sense of something
     that needs to be explicitly stated.
     The medium, whether billboard,
     magazine page, or screen pixels,
     while important, is also self-evident.

I am not so sure what we are talking about here, so I'll make a guess.
In a "formal study", a structure-oriented investigation, of signs, the
medium is an incidental parameter, and I suspect that it is vastly more
transparent than truly self-evident, just as we, in employing what we so
airily and summarily describe as "This Medium", are barely aware of even
a zillionth of the variety of information-preserving transformations that
intervene between the transmission and the reception of any stream of bits.

DM:  Understanding:
     The symbol "rose" standing metonymously
     for a pink imaginary disc in an imaginary game.

JA:  Now I used to think I knew what "metonymy" meant.
     Toward what purpose do you purpose the word here?
     According to the correspondence between my sight
     and my understanding this very word "rose" marks
     a hue that by any other name would blush as pink.

DM:  Again, I'm using it in the standard sense of "a figure of speech
     consisting of the use of the name of one thing for that of another
     of which it is an attribute or with which it is associated".  I'm
     not talking about the correspondence between "rose" and "pink" here,
     but rather my belief that rose or pink are being used as a shorthand
     reference to the disc of that color in the imaginary Tower of Hanoi
     game under discussion.

Okay, I get a part of it.  You take it that the flower came first,
whose name was "rose", and whose color, of some variety, was pink,
and that it is metonymy to call anything else of that color "rose".
Modulo the assumption that the "Name of the Rose" came first, that
accords with my understanding of metonymy.  I will check this guess
with the Army of Websters, but later.

What I do not get is why it is such a problem
to talk about a property as an object, since
your pent-up-manship of 8 over 3 shows that
you are certainly no dogmatic ockhamist.

DM:  Intended recipient(s) of sign:
     Participants in the e-mail list of a working group
     of an international standards body.

JA:  Does this affect the meaning of the French word "rose"?

DM:  It absolutely affects the big and bit object of that word
     in the instance of use.

JA:  Then let me suggest that we account for the factor
     of the intended audience in terms of these effects.

DM:  *********** End sign instance ***********

DM:  Notice that this example is created from the point of view
     of the sign emitter, rather than the sign recipient.  I am
     just now realizing that this may be a major disconnect between
     what you are trying to do and what I hope to accomplish through
     participation in SUO.  Your work seems to be centered on inquiry,
     where my concern is communication.

JA:  If you never reach a point in the process of communication
     where disagreement, misunderstanding, or uncertainty arises,
     or even has the future prospect of arising, then the topic
     of inquiry will not have any relevance to you.  Otherwise,
     you will find yourself soon engaged in a problematic that
     has a remarkable formal similarity to that covered under
     the heading of "inquiry", whatever name you call it by.

DM:  I agree that inquiry is intrinsic.  My only point is that you seem
     to working from the position of the inquirer, who is trying to make
     sense of an otherwise undifferentiated field of sign impressions, ...

I start out from the blocks of one who is annoyed by doubts and
irritated by uncertainties, and who endeavors to clear these up.
The subsequent proceeding of clarification is, by dint of a long
tradition, conveniently summed up under the heading of "inquiry".
The relation of this enterprise to the business of constructing
ontologies is a matter that I have addressed on many occasions,
and no doubt will again, but the phrase that most frequently
comes to mind is this one from John Dewey's 'How We Think':

| In any event, it is desirable that the teacher
| should rid himself of the notion that "thinking"
| is a single, unalterable faculty;  that he should
| recognize that it is a term denoting the various ways
| in which things acquire significance.
|
| <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg05116.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg05116.html</A>

This idea, that "thinking" -- for which I read "inquiry", in accord with
the context of the utterance and of its applications, both here and there --
is "a term denoting the various ways in which things acquire significance",
is a key to the evolving relationships among things as we come to call them
and the process by which we arrive at all of our concepts and terms, which,
as I keep trying to remind people, are not invented out of whim and do not
fall from the sky in some Adamaic/Mosaic manner, but need to be shaped to
fit the situation of their instigation, thus to find or to make a solution
to some very old problem or some very new question.  Without understanding
the process by which concepts are actually conceived we can only continue
in a host of false conceits.

DM:  ... where I'm working in an area of situated purposeful communications,
     where a lot of the context is known by all parties, but further progress
     stands to be made via the conceptual and technological tools I alluded
     to above.  This harks back to our earlier discussion of the Pynchon
     references to philately, which I agreed were interesting to think
     about, but not likely to cause problems of ambiguity in the
     context of the example provided by Matthew West (I think).

DM:  For the kind of issues I am trying to address e.g. commercial
     transactions among humans, using computer and telecommunications
     networks) I think that it is much more possible to address the problem
     from the point of view of what's going on with emitters than recipients
     of signs.  We're much more likely to be able to identify them, and to
     actually inquire into what is going on in their minds with respect
     to purposes and understandings.

JA:  I am tempted not to answer at this point.
     That would teach you not to consider the
     recipient.  Instead I will emit this bit
     of a reply to remind you how dialectical
     are these entangled aspects of dialogues.

DM:  Again, I think this is a manifestation of the difference between
     your more general, and my more specific domains of concern for
     this particular work effort (IEEE SUO).

In this man's army, the specialist must obey the general.

DM:  *  In a very real sense every sign is irreducible with respect to these
        eight aspects (sign, referent, emitter, recipient, occasion, medium,
        purpose understanding).

JA:  Proof?

DM:  Not now, and probably not ever, in the sense of proof
     I've come to understand you to require.

It's a dirty job, I know, but somebody's got to do it.
This business will soon be bankrupt without its funds.

DM:  *  Some of the aspects may be unknown at various points in time,
        or unknowable external to an individual sign emitter or recipient.

     *  The medium tends to be common between emitter and recipient
        (sound waves, magazine page, billboard, etc., with more
        variation possible in the instance of computer networks).

     *  There is complexity within each of these aspects, but most
        especially with respect to purposes and understandings.

     *  Correspondence among understandings has a lot to do with
        correspondence (or symmetry) among purposes.

     *  The general purpose for efforts like SUO, in my opinion,
        has to do specifically with helping to line up understandings
        between emitters and recipients.  It is because of the ambiguity
        of signs based on implicit and mismatched understandings that we
        want to devise schemes for making dimensions of understanding
        explicit, so that signs will be interpreted identically (or
        at least similarly) by multiple recipients, and in
        correspondence with the purpose of the emitter.

DM:  For instance, the Tower of Hanoi is not really a discussion
     of the spectral analysis of color, but rather imaginary discs
     that are distinguished by color, such that the dimensions of
     understanding will not line up properly without placing them
     in the ontology of imagined molecular objects, rather than
     the ontology of color terms.

JA:  I think that you may have forgotten about the "Dialogue In Nature" (DIN),
     that we have so much less ability to shout down and to gain control over.

DM:  I would say it's not so much forgotten, as it is that
     I simply have a less ambitious objective.  I'm willing
     to assume that virtually all of the din of the universe
     of signs has been filtered, ...

Assumptions are things that need to be tested.
Do you have in mind how you would go about testing this,
or would you prefer to maintain it as a soothing fiction,
anyway, no matter what may happen to really be the case?

DM:  ... and that I aspire merely to provide incremental clarity to
     those business emissions of externalized utterance that are
     somewhat, but not infinitely, problematic at the current time.

I guess I believe that even humble business-persons -- maybe even
especially humble business-persons -- recognize that there is more
to effective communication and doing business in the real world than
simply "keeping our stories straight" among ourselves -- that would be
tantamount to the philosophical position that is called "coherentism" --
that it requires a never-ending quest to understand what the worlds
of inner and outer Nature are trying to get through our thick heads.

DM:  Maybe an extracted essence of Charles Sanders Peirce
     may in the end prove helpful to me in this limited
     (but challenging) objective.  Or not.

Do you really want to find out in hardest way possible,
by dint or by stint of the worst case scenario?  Not I.
