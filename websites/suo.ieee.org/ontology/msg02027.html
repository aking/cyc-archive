&gt;Pat, Jon, et al.,
&gt;
&gt;This confusion of terminology is inevitable in any project,
&gt;report, or standard that involves multidisciplinary
&gt;collaboration.
&gt;
&gt;PH&gt;Sorry, we are getting our communication wires crossed by a pun on
&gt; &gt;"class". Mathematicians use the word in a very particular way, which
&gt; &gt;in its full form is written "proper class", to refer to things that
&gt; &gt;anyone but a mathematican (and even some of them) would call a set,
&gt; &gt;except they are so big that if they are accepted into the
&gt; &gt;set-theoretic universe they would give rise to paradoxes.
&gt;
&gt;This use is known only to the subgroup of mathematicians who
&gt;are working on logic and foundations.  Working mathematicians
&gt;in algebra, topology, differential equations, etc., may be
&gt;aware of the term, but they almost never use improper classes.

True. But category theorists often have a sharpened sense of classes 
in this sense, and are aggressive about using them.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; In the
&gt; &gt;wider word, however, the term "class" is used in a sense which is
&gt; &gt;closely linked to "classification", to refer to (the extension of) a
&gt; &gt;named category in some kind of classification heirarchy. Such classes
&gt; &gt;all have sets as their extension (or, maybe, ARE sets), but not every
&gt; &gt;set would normally be dignified with the title of 'class(ification)'
&gt;
&gt;This is another common use.  But in the programming language
&gt;community (which now includes almost every computer science
&gt;major and almost everybody who has ever used or heard about
&gt;object-oriented programming languages) a class has a very
&gt;specific meaning:  it is a kind of data type that has
&gt;associated methods.

That isn't incompatible with the CLASSIC/LOOM usage, however.

&gt; &gt;Im afraid that this sense of 'class' has already been in widespread
&gt; &gt;use throughout at least one of the broader technical ontology
&gt; &gt;communities for about a decade now. Check out the literature on
&gt; &gt;description logics and such ontological 'standards' as LOOM and
&gt; &gt;CLASSIC.
&gt;
&gt;Essentially all AI languages, from LISP and Prolog to LOOM,
&gt;Classic, CLIPS, etc., are almost unknown among the overwhelming
&gt;majority of programmers in the world.  For computer science
&gt;majors and working programmers today, a class is a data type
&gt;with methods.

True, but programmers are not our only (or even intended primary) 
audience here, I would judge.

&gt;When you have a word, such as "class", with so many different
&gt;meanings to so many different people who are potential users
&gt;of the SUO, I believe that it is tainted beyond all usefulness.
&gt;
&gt;Recommendation:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Use the word "set" in its purely extensional sense, as
&gt;    in "naive" set theory and its more axiomatized versions.

I agree, and always try to do this.

&gt; 2. Do not use the word "class" as a technical word in KIF
&gt;    or the SUO.

Take this up with Adam and Chris. I have been simply following their 
usage; though I note that it is also ubiquitous in the DAML community.

&gt; 3. Select some term from the set {"type", "sort", "category"),
&gt;    and use it for both the KIF sorts and the things in the
&gt;    SUO hierarchy.

I agree, and chose the word "sort". But as you know, this has some 
usage baggage associated with it in the logical world.

&gt; 4. Define a denotation operator, which for any domain of
&gt;    discourse, maps the things in point #3 to sets.

well...except we don;t want to call it 'denotation', since by and 
large it doenst relate signs to their denotata so much as denoted 
things to their extensions. Modulo this, I agree: this is Chris 
Menzel's ASSOC function (part of his model theory.)

&gt; 5. Avoid making a commitment whether the things mentioned
&gt;    in point #3 are or are not identical to their denotations,
&gt;    since we may want to talk about multiple universes or
&gt;    domains of discourse at some time in the future.

We have already made that decision: Chris Menzel's semantics embody 
the required agnosticism very precisely.
