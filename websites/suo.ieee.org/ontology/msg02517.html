&gt; &gt; The last time I met Doug (about 6 months ago) I talked to him about
&gt; &gt; the SUO, briefly. I asked him whether it wouldnt make sense to simply
&gt; &gt; remove the 'upper ontology' from CYC altogether, and have an
&gt; &gt; inheritance hierarchy which simply had a large number of top nodes
&gt; &gt; (which would be, roughly, the tips of the upper ontology
&gt; &gt; classification.) He agreed, and said that he had in fact seriously
&gt; &gt; suggested making that change some years earlier, but that his
&gt; &gt; customer base all protested that they preferred to have a single top
&gt; &gt; node. He shrugged, with the implication that if thats what they want,
&gt; &gt; he was willing to let them keep it. So I think that your and Doug's
&gt; &gt; viewpoints are not quite identical; he thinks the upper levels of the
&gt; &gt; ontology are irrelevant and distracting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;   Unfortunately, Doug Lenat is also of the opinion that there should
&gt;be only **one** middle ontology, namely CYC.  OF course, if we have only
&gt;one middle ontology, then any upper ontology consistent with it
&gt;will be as good as any other, and no upper is in fact needed.  But
&gt;if we have **more than one** middle or domain ontology, the concern
&gt;is that there will be incompatible concepts defined in the disparate
&gt;ontologies,

Suppose there were. What would be the problem? Presumably, the need 
to translate between them. For example, if you think of time 
intervals as sets of timepoints, and I think of them as intervals 
lying between meeting-places, our ontological assumptions will 
occassionally clash and cause our reasoners to draw opposite 
conclusions. Right?

&gt;and the only way to avoid that is to construct an upper
&gt;ontology from the top levels down; if lower ontologies are defined in
&gt;terms of the upper levels, some interoperability should result.

Now suppose that the higher-level agreed ontology simply refers to 
'intervals' as a category and makes no committment to the nature of 
those intervals. Then both these conflicting ontologies will fit 
under it happily, but that fitting will not produce any new agreement 
or interoperability. Such mutual agreement could only arise if the 
'upper' level imposed enough structure on the 'interval' category to 
insist that one or both of these clashing ontologies were to be 
altered so as to produce agreement. Which means, in turn, that the 
'upper' ontology has to reach down, as it were, far enough to iron 
out the details that give rise to the clash. It has to make a genuine 
ontological committment to one as opposed to the other view, and rule 
one of them out a priori.

The overall point being that if an ontology is high-level enough to 
be genuinely high-level, a kind of ecumenical standard under which a 
variety of alternatives can be fitted, then it is not going to 
produce or impose interoperability. The clashes that spoil 
interoperability only arise at a certain level of detail.

The same kind of story can be told at almost any level. We have 
already seen examples at a rather 'high' level in the debates about 
4-d versus continuant ontologies, and to find similar problems at a 
very 'low' level one has only to go into the database literature.

&gt;This seems a priori like a methodology far more likely to result
&gt;in interoperability than to hope that by some fortuitous coincidence
&gt;two separately developed ontologies can be reduced to common terms.

That is not the suggestion: rather, it is to seek for methods which 
can be used to resolve conflicts, rather than impose ad-hoc arbitrary 
'standard' choices.

&gt;I thought it was precisely the inability to make a common logical
&gt;system from separately developed ontologies that was the motivation
&gt;for work on a SUO.  It is certainly my motivation.
&gt;
&gt;[Pat Hayes]
&gt; &gt; I might add that this methodology is supported to some extent by
&gt; &gt; empirical work on concept mining, where a key strategy in identifying
&gt; &gt; useful conceptual dimensions is to find the ways that concepts can be
&gt; &gt; teased apart, ie how they differ as well as the ways they are
&gt; &gt; similar. The key question to ask is, given three concepts A, B and C:
&gt; &gt; in what way would B be closest to A and furthest from C? The point
&gt; &gt; being that this kind of analysis requires a level of detail which
&gt; &gt; only becomes apparent when one has a reasonable amount of particular
&gt; &gt; detailed knowledge to apply it to.
&gt;    This is certainly a useful method to discover precisely what
&gt;different
&gt;people intend when they formalize their conceptualizations, but I was
&gt;under the impression that:
&gt;(1) there is no easy way to make one formal ontology to communicate with
&gt;another
&gt;developed separately; the kind of analysis that Pat Hayes suggests is
&gt;very
&gt;time-consuming and at the end, the two different ontology builders need
&gt;to come to some agreement as to which common set of concepts can be used
&gt;to allow interoperability; but
&gt;(2) doing it this way is no faster, and probably a lot slower than
&gt;building a common upper ontology of defining concepts and then
&gt;having users build their specialized ontologies in those terms.

That has all the advantages of fascism over democracy. What must 
someone who wants to use an ontological framework different from the 
'standard' do? Who will do this 'having' that makes sure users will 
conform? For example, both Matthew West and I will not be willing to 
move to a continuant style ontology over a 4-d one, and others feel 
just as strongly the other way. The right way to go, surely, is to 
find ways that genuine  alternatives can coexist and communicate with 
each other (as I tried to do using 'flickerbook sets') rather than 
having a couple of people decide on one alternative, on unknown 
grounds, using an unknown method, for no visible reason, and then 
declare that to be an international standard by default.

&gt;(3)  There has already been a lot of "concept mining" from middle-level
&gt;ontologies, but in the absence of a coordinated project to share
&gt;these insights and integrate them into a logically consistent whole,
&gt;they remain largely unusable in systems other than those in which
&gt;they were developed.
&gt;
&gt;  I agree that this is an important issue for the SUO, but I thought
&gt;that
&gt;the whole project of the SUO was predicated on at least the first two
&gt;assertions
&gt;above.  If Pat Hayes is aware of successful examples of merger of
&gt;middle-level ontologies, it could be very helpful to study and learn
&gt;from
&gt;such cases.

Ironically, the central heiriarchy used in the merged ontology is an example.
