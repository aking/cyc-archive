Subject:  &quot;Laws &amp; Models&quot;, EKA (Erstwhile Known As):

| Abstraction, Analogy, Arrow, Epitome, Example,
| Icon, Law, Metaphor, Model, Morphism, Paradigm,
| Prototype, Rule, Simulacrum, Simulation, Theory.

Arisbeans, OCAsionals, Brand X Ontologists:

Exercise for the reader.
Divide the congeries of terms in the extended title above into a couple of
subtitles, consisting of terms that are more consistently alike each other.

I see myself getting into another discussion of laws, models, paradigms, and theories,
but before I dare to do that, rational procedure dictates that I do a duty of autopsy
on the lingering discourse of a previous discussation in the very same topics as this,
that I was shocked to discover in which I persisted through a sevenmonth of last year.

Perhaps some observer here can help me
to sort out exactly where I went wrong.

I keep coming back to the following two pictures or configurations:

1.  There is that A-frame construction in Aristotle's discussion
    of reasoning by way of Analogy, Example, or Paradigm, which
    he articulates as a combination of Induction and Deduction.

|                           Atrocious Adversity
|                                    A
|                                    o

|                                 /  *  \
|                                /   *   \
|                               /    *    \
|                              /     *     \
|                             /   R u l e   \
|                            /       *       \
|                           /        *        \
|                          /     Bellicose     \
|                         /       Battles       \
|                     F a c t        B        F a c t
|                       /         Between         \
|                      /        Bordermates        \
|                     /        *           *        \
|                    /       *               *       \
|                   /   C a s e             C a s e   \
|                  /     *                       *     \
|                 /    *                           *    \
|                /   *                               *   \

|              / *                                       * \
|             o                                             o
|            C                                               D
|         Contest:                                        Debacle:
|   Athens versus Thebes                            Thebes versus Phocis
|
| Figure 2.  Aristotle's &quot;War Against Neighbors&quot; Example
|
| A  =  Atrocious, Adverse to All, A bad thing.
| B  =  Belligerent Battle Between Brethren.
| C  =  Contest of Athens against Thebes.
| D  =  Debacle of Thebes against Phocis.
|
| A is a major term,
| B is a middle term,
| C is a minor term,
| D is a minor term, similar to C.

Note on Terminology:  I am using the terms &quot;Case&quot;, &quot;Fact&quot;, &quot;Rule&quot;
in the medieval manner that was added to the classical treatment
of syllogism at a somewhat later time, but predating our present
usage by several hundered years.  Under this schematization, one
enumerates the following three forms of reasoning:

Abduction:  Fact + Rule ---&gt; Case,
Deduction:  Case + Rule ---&gt; Fact,
Induction:  Case + Fact ---&gt; Rule.

The cardinal- or hinge-point to note about Aristotle's example
of reasoning by example is that the middle term B serves as an
explanation of 'why' the major term A should be considered as
applicable to the contemplated instances of conflict, C and D,
instance C a future contingent whose advisability of rendering
actual was presently, at that time in Athens, being disputed,
instance D already a part of the discussants' previous history,
from which they might reasonably be expected to have learned.

2.  The other picture is John Sowa's World-Model-Theory Triptych:

Well, it took me so much time to find the loose ends of this thread
that I have plumb forgot what I was going to say, but I remember
that I saw some kind of analogy between these two pictures --
(Between Analogy Analogy Triptych)? -- and so I am sure that
if I take a little break it will all come back to me, soon.

JA: Well, it took me so much time to find the loose ends of this thread
    that I have plumb forgot what I was going to say, but I remember
    that I saw some kind of analogy between these two pictures --
    (Between Analogy Analogy Triptych)? -- and so I am sure that
    if I take a little break it will all come back to me, soon.

PJ: One way to construct an analogy might be along the lines:

    &quot;The world is all that is the case&quot;,
    as Wittgenstein said at one time.

JA: I am taking a bit of a risk trying to preserve these antic notions
    of &quot;Case&quot;, &quot;Fact&quot;, &quot;Rule&quot;, and their relationships to various forms
    of inference, both demonstrative and otherwise, especially alongside
    of the more finely geared up and more sharply tooled up instrumental
    senses that we have become accustomed, in modern times, to be using --
    and so I genuinely fear exceeding my margin of tolerance by trying
    to bring that &quot;Master of those Games that are Played with Stones&quot;,
    Ludovico Wittgenstein, into the mix of my concrete foundations.

JA: If you wish to do this, then we will have to make sure that
    we carefully examine the assembled tokens and playing pieces,
    for instance, these little bitty words, &quot;case&quot;, &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;,
    to see if all of the puzzle pieces really do belong in, or even
    ever came from, the same box, otherwise I fear that we will soon
    become the mercilessly strained victims of a hopelessly scrambled
    and inescapably dis-integral picture.

PJ: A model (of a theory) may be considered as a collection of facts.

JA: Well, you are stealing some of my most portentous rumbling here,
    but one of my aims in stringing out this thread is to introduce
    a &quot;trial&quot; notion of what constitutes a &quot;model&quot;.  Up until a few
    days ago, I would have said &quot;dual&quot; notion, but as every good
    Peircean (and every good Freudian) eventually must, I am
    beginning to e-spy the spectre of thirdness raising its
    three urly heads.

JA: I used to think that a &quot;model&quot; was &quot;anything about which
    a statement or a theory holds&quot;, thereby putting it into
    close relationship with the notion of a semantic object,
    that is, anything that a sign denotes.  Moreover, I was
    used to thinking -- or was that just my imagination? --
    that this was the sense of it that currently prevailed
    in the logical subject that we know as &quot;model theory&quot;,
    and yet, I am beginning to have my doubts about that.

JA: So let me distinguish this sense of the word &quot;model&quot; from
    whatever it is that does presently dominate the thinking
    of those who currently practice this &quot;theory of models&quot;,
    and let me give it a name, that nobody else will desire,
    dubbing it the &quot;naive&quot; or the &quot;natural&quot; sense of &quot;model&quot;.

JA: Let me re-capitulate the triune heads of this dogma:

    1.  The naive meaning or the natural sense of the term &quot;model&quot;.

    2.  The logical meaning of &quot;model&quot; that we find, or hope to find,
        in the customary conduct and the standard practices of that
        formal subject that is called, by convention, &quot;model theory&quot;.

    3.  The analogical meaning of &quot;model&quot;, wherein it is related to
        a whole host of notions like &quot;analogue&quot;, &quot;avatar&quot;, &quot;copy&quot;,
        &quot;facsimile&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;, &quot;image&quot;, &quot;likeness&quot;, &quot;representation&quot;,
        &quot;reproduction&quot;, &quot;simulacre&quot;, &quot;simulation&quot;, and so on.

PJ: A theory may be considered as a collection of rules.

JA: Well, I usually consider a theory to be a collection of sentences,
    or, perhaps, the abstract propositions, the hypostatic statements,
    or the &quot;logical equivalence classes&quot; (LEC's) of signs that may be
    thought to correspond with these expressions, formulae, sentences.

PJ: These statements are open to further discussion, of course.

PJ: Patrick Grim's book &quot;The Incomplete Universe&quot; presents a collection of arguments
    against &quot;The world is all that is the case&quot;.  We could (indeed, must) accept
    incompleteness and talk in terms of &quot;everything we know that is the case&quot;,
    while granting that the world is larger than what we know.

PJ: Viewing a model as a collection of facts which satisfies a theory,
    is not the same as viewing a model as something that explains or
    emulates some phenomenon or situation.  This second concept of
    model is closer to the concept of a scientific theory ...
