FOO SIG,

(The preposition "OF" is a very significant word to me.)

Woke up with a few additional thoughts
on Jim's reading of John's comment --
see below:

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This posting follows up on four recent postings to the SUO
&gt; &gt; list concerning the foundations of ontology, basic terminology,
&gt; &gt; the nature of modeling, and the roles of syntax and semantics
&gt; &gt; in first-order logic. These four postings are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02304.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02304.html</A>
&gt; &gt; (November 22, 2000; John Sowa),
&gt; &gt; which deals with a suggested approach to the foundations of ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02398.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02398.html</A>
&gt; &gt; (November 29, 2000; John Sowa),
&gt; &gt; which deals with basic terminological distinctions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02412.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02412.html</A>
&gt; &gt; (November 29, 2000; John Sowa),
&gt; &gt; which discusses supervaluation and which refers to a figure at
&gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/mthworld.gif</A>. This figure
&gt; &gt; depicts relationships among World, Model, and Theory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02449.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg02449.html</A>
&gt; &gt; (December 1, 2000; Robert Kent),
&gt; &gt; which supplies a PDF file describing "various syntactic and semantic
&gt; &gt; components of 1st order logic."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In posting 1, John Sowa considers the
&gt; &gt; topic "foundations of ontology" to be:
&gt; &gt; "a critical examination of the principles for
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     (1) analyzing a subject domain,
&gt; &gt;     (2) identifying and classifying critical aspects, and
&gt; &gt;     (3) specifying them in a way that some formalization
&gt; &gt;         in a language such as KIF would be possible."
&gt; 
&gt; I went back and read John's note again in the light of your remarks.
&gt; The business of identifying assumptions and distinctions is a very
&gt; important step for me.  I often find myself describing it under the
&gt; three rubrics of "articulation", "reflection", and "relativization".
&gt; By this I mean the kind of reflection on our autonomous experience
&gt; and automatic conduct that allows us to articulate and express in
&gt; explicit signs the sorts of beliefs which we just a moment before
&gt; were taking for granted, perhaps never before even conscious of
&gt; them, and thus to re-express formerly absolute beliefs as being
&gt; contingent or relative beliefs.  This reminds me of what we do
&gt; in logic when we shift from "A |- B" to "|- A =&gt; B", that is,
&gt; if you consider the statements before the turnstile as being
&gt; analogous in a way to unexamined or taken for granted ideas.
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment when I start to reflect, I usually find that
&gt; I have been engaged in some stream of unthinking conduct,
&gt; and what it is that ripples this stream and causes me to
&gt; reflect is almost always one of two types of alteration,
&gt; change, difference, dissatisfaction, disturbance, jolt,
&gt; shift, shock, or strife that occurs within my experience.
&gt; Notice that all of these things have in common the aspect
&gt; or the idea of a "difference", and it is only here that we
&gt; pass from a sense of all-pervading confluence in experience
&gt; to a sense of boundaries, definitions, domains, and limits.
&gt; 
&gt; But I said that I could see these experiences of difference
&gt; falling mainly into a couple of types.  There is what I call
&gt; a "surprising phenomenon", which involves a difference between
&gt; what one expects and what one observes.  There is what I call
&gt; a "problematic situation", which involves a difference between
&gt; what one intends and what one observes.  Each of these serves
&gt; as a spur to a different sort of action.
&gt; 
&gt; A surprising phenomenon leads to a search for the sort
&gt; of theoretical statement that will serve as an explanation
&gt; for the phenomenon, thereby decreasing the disparity between
&gt; the actual and the expected events and reducing the affective
&gt; sense of surprise that accompanies the phenomenon.
&gt; 
&gt; A problematic situation leads to a search for the sort
&gt; of practical policy that will serve a plan of action
&gt; for resolving the problem, by bringing the actual
&gt; and the desired states back into accord.
&gt; 
&gt; These are the themes that come to mind when I think
&gt; of the nature, the occasion, and the springs of the
&gt; kind of reflection that is needed to fund a critical
&gt; examination of the automatic assumptions, the basic
&gt; beliefs, the concepts, and the distinctions in our
&gt; experience that constitute what we commonly call
&gt; a "domain".
&gt; 
&gt; That's (1).  But now I must break for today.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for throwing some interesting lights on this subject.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey

Jim, John, Robert, &amp; All,

I just realized what it is that John is talking about,
at least, as I think that I would be able to classify
it from within the frame of my own thinking (mostly
adapted from the pragmatic framework of Peirce).

I think he is asking, in different words, the same
question that I often ask about the relationship
of deductive reasoning to reasoning in general,
as to how we ought to reason before we have
the sorts of axioms and definitions that
it takes to get deduction started.

| What form of reasoning should we use to argue
| 'toward' a definition or 'toward' an axiom? --
| certainly not the manner of reasoning that
| requires axioms and definitions to start!

In pragmatic thinking these other types of inference,
these other brands and stamps of logical procedure,
aside from the "demonstrative" style of reasoning
that we enjoy with deductive logic, are classified
as "abductive" and "inductive" forms of reasoning,
which together make up the "non-demonstrative" ilk
of inference, and are thus never guaranteed of any
sort of apodictically certain result.

The typical cycle of inquiry proceeds through these
types of reasoning in the order Ab-/De-/In-Duction,
where abduction has more to do with the discovery
phase and where induction has more to do with the
critical, probative, or testing phase of research.

I have discussed an elementary example of this "cycle of inquiry",
to the extent that its structure could be captured within a purely
propositional and syllogistic form of representation, several times
before, for instance, at these loci:

Gotta run, many put-off chores to do today --
