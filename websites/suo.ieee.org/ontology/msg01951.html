Scanning ahead, I can see that we need some kind of work-around for
the proposition-as-object versus proposition-as-sign quasi-problem.
What can we do?  It a source of some bemusement to me that I lost
this particular battle -- it would be easy, all too easy for me
to go back to the way that I spoke ten years ago and the way in
which I wrote the first couple of drafts of my dissertation --
maybe you get more respect in your circle than I get in mine --
every time I read the words "predicate" and "proposition" I hear
them shouting "spoken before" and "placed before", respectively,
each of which literally screams "syntactic entity ahead" to me,
and I know that these are Latin residuals of the Greek schemata
in which the predicate letter was placed in front of the subject,
and I have written several whole diatribes to various discursion
tribes on the subject of "apophansis", all to no avail, and then,
to be fair, there are indeed other sensible readings of what these
terms mean.  I am also content to leave the term ambiguous, if you
want to be my champion on the lists for that, perhaps to challenge
each and every appearance of this interloping nit-errant to bear
a token of its type on its sleeve, like "Prop:Obj" &amp; "Prop:Sig",
or devices of that order.

&gt; and explain the primary implication of my definition of "proposition",
&gt; which is, I believe, of extreme importance to many practical problems
&gt; having to do with the SUO, the semantic web, and many related issues
&gt; in computational semeiotic.
&gt; 
&gt; On the SUO list, we have been discussing the KIF language,
&gt; the CG language, various versions of controlled natural
&gt; languages, such as ACE, and various stripped-down versions
&gt; of logic designed for the WWW, such as RDF, OIL, DAML, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Each of these languages has its own peculiar syntax, but
&gt; it is a highly desirable, even the primary purpose of the
&gt; SUO to facilitate the transfer of information ...

Information?  There again, twenty or thirty years ago
that was a Holy Word, and people had a bit of respect
for its definition -- now it just means "string", or
something even more tangled.

&gt; from one to the other that satisfies the following four requirements:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Invertible:  If sentence s1 expressed in language L1 is
&gt;     translated to a sentence s2 in language L2, it should be
&gt;     possible to translate s2 to a sentence s3 in L1.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Proof preserving:  The sentence s3 in language L1 should
&gt;     either be identical to the original sentence s1 or it
&gt;     should be provably equivalent (in the sense of "if and
&gt;     only if") according to whatever rules of inference are
&gt;     used in language L1.

Do you not foresee any potential problem here,
forcing semantics, or model-theory, to lean 
too much on syntactics, or proof-theory?

&gt;  3. Vocabulary preserving:  The nonlogical vocabulary (i.e.,
&gt;     the "content" terms) of the sentences s3 and s1 should be
&gt;     the same or synonymous (i.e., if t1 in s1 is replaced by
&gt;     t3 in s3, there should be some definition in L1 that says
&gt;     that t1 is a synonym for t3).
&gt; 
&gt;  4. Structure preserving:  When s1 and s3 are converted to
&gt;     Peirce Normal Form (with negation, conjunction, and the
&gt;     existential quantifier as the only logical operators),
&gt;     the number of negations and quantifiers is the same,
&gt;     and they are nested in isomorphic syntactic patterns.
&gt; 
&gt; These are the four requirements for what
&gt; I called "meaning-preserving translations".
&gt; For a refresher, following is the excerpt
&gt; from Ch 5 of my KR book in which I define
&gt; and illustrate the definitions:
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/logic/meaning.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/logic/meaning.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; The purpose of those translations is to enable us to give
&gt; a formal and efficiently computable definition of what it
&gt; means for two sentences in different formal languages to
&gt; "mean the same thing".  For the sake of the traditional use
&gt; in logic over the past 700 years (see, for example, Peirce's
&gt; comments about the ethics of terminology), I call that "thing"
&gt; a proposition.  So far, nothing you have said has indicated
&gt; to me that there is anything wrong with either (1) the goal
&gt; that needs to be addressed or (2) my proposed way of reaching
&gt; that goal.

There were several different religions on the scene before him,
and whole lot a variety in their understandings of this stuff.

&gt; Your primary objection seems to be to my choice of the
&gt; word "proposition" for the "meaning of a sentence".

No, it's not.  That is what I also say.
But I mean it as a denotative meaning,
and I am just not sure how you mean it,
as you appear to have yet again shifted
from using it for a thing in a sign role
to using it for a thing in an object role.
All in all, over time, I cannot tell which.

&gt; However, nothing you have said convinces me that there
&gt; is anything wrong with my choice.  Nor have you showed
&gt; how anything that you are doing would satisfy the four
&gt; requirements that I was trying to address.
&gt; 
&gt; Some comments:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is, of course, far more efficient to carry out all
&gt; &gt; of the needed transformations on the pointer-structure
&gt; &gt; rather than on the text string, so it is convenient for
&gt; &gt; practical purposes to recognize the resulting parse-graphs,
&gt; &gt; much like the function of diagrams in mathematical thinking,
&gt; &gt; as a theoretically respectable species, family, clan of signs.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.  I would say that the graphs represent just one more
&gt; formal language, which could be added to the list mentioned
&gt; in the second paragraph of my note above.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, just the way I see things, and was able to teach a computer to do so,
&gt; &gt; a name like "g", an expression like "((p(q))(q(s))((pq(rs))))", and a graph
&gt; &gt; like the one shown above are all just as capable, given a suitable interpreter
&gt; &gt; to bring them to life, of being the signs of this sort of more or less abstract,
&gt; &gt; formal, ideal, logical, mathematical object that most folks ...
&gt; 
&gt; Which folks?  I use the term "proposition" in the way I defined above.
&gt; If there are any folks who need education, please ask them to read my
&gt; KR book.

I will dig up citations if you want.  People who consider themselves to be
experts already can be very hard to educate, as Frank Lloyd Wright remarked.

&gt; &gt; 1.  p = paitrick, q = quail,   r = rooster,   s = sandpiper.
&gt; &gt; 2.  p = particle, q = quantum, r = radiation, s = static.
&gt; &gt; 3.  p = person,   q = quorum,  r = rule,      s = standard.
&gt; 
&gt; Please note requirement #3 of vocabulary preserving.
&gt; When you translate from L1 to L2, the words may change,
&gt; but when you translate back to L1, you must recover exactly
&gt; the same vocabulary (or something defined to be synonymous).

Had to write this in a rush before dinner,
so if it sounds terse, that's mostly why,
will try a second pass later on tonight.
