Phil,
   I take John's comments not to suggest that we should avoid semiotics per 
se, but that our inclusion of such concepts in the SUO should be motivated 
by practical representational needs rather than an infinite philosophical 
regress that might result from considering the SUO itself as a set of signs 
(although it certainly is that).
   In a long ago thread, I suggested that the SUO need to support stating 
things such as

Hamlet the fictional character
Hamlet an edition of the printed play
A performance of Hamlet
A performance of Hamlet captured on video and encoded as a bit stream
The text of Hamlet as character strings
What Fritz Lehmann has called a "conceptual work" - the timeless 
informational content of the play

These notions require a well worked out theory of semiotics but this would 
have a practical focus rather than being an academic exercise.

&gt;Jon,

&gt;I have changed the subject of this email thread to note that it is about a
&gt;specific subtopic, the role of semiotics in SUO, while my original email
&gt;thread was about more general topics, i.e. the need for requirements
&gt;specifications, requirements traceability, etc. in SUO.
&gt;
&gt;To summarize your message, there seem to be at least the following
&gt;alternative perspectives:
&gt;
&gt;1) semiotic concepts have no place in SUO, since ontologies are supposed to
&gt;be about things that exist, while semiotics is about signs for things that
&gt;exist.
&gt;
&gt;2) signs are things, and so semiotic concepts could be included in an
&gt;ontology, as "yet another subject matter" of the ontology.
&gt;
&gt;3) a theory of signs is fundamental to logic and to the language for the
&gt;ontology. So the language, and perhaps the ontology also, needs to be
&gt;developed based on a theory of signs.
&gt;
&gt;The first two perspectives may easily be translated to a requirements
&gt;question: Should signs (and related concepts) be included in or excluded
&gt;from the ontology?
&gt;
&gt;Can the third perspective be phrased in terms of concise, well-defined
&gt;requirements for either the ontology or its language? If so, what are these
&gt;proposed requirements? This is a question which everyone can address as they
&gt;choose, of course...
&gt;
&gt;One answer to this question might be that KIF is already adequately based on
&gt;a theory of signs, since there is a mapping between KIF and Conceptual
&gt;Graphs, which are based largely on Peirce's existential graphs. It would be
&gt;interesting to hear some specific thoughts pro or con this point of view.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Phil,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Long time no see!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for helping me to pin down the locations
&gt; &gt; of some of the tenter-hooks that we are hung-up
&gt; &gt; and hanging-on here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will just interject, within your text,
&gt; &gt; the first things that come into my mind.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Jim, and all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Once again I will jump into the fray with a few
&gt; &gt; &gt; comments and suggestions for how to proceed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that SUO has been making progress,
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet three central issues are unresolved:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) What are the objectives for use of the SUO?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) What are the requirements for the SUO?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What are the requirements for the language(s)
&gt; &gt; &gt;    in which the SUO will be represented?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Before we can decide what language to use we
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to agree on the requirements for the language.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The requirements for the language depend on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirements for the SUO, which depend on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; objectives for the SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Much of the discussion in SUO seems to involve these issues
&gt; &gt; &gt; while trying to make progress on theoretical questions related
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the SUO itself.  There needs to be a consensus on these issues
&gt; &gt; &gt; before people can agree about the value of any proposed candidate
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the SUO, or any proposed elements of an SUO, though efforts
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as Ian Niles' "merged ontology" are valuable at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; as strawmen to help identify issues.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The objectives of the SUO are addressed briefly at the SUO website,
&gt; &gt; &gt; in sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, though questions
&gt; &gt; &gt; still arise about the objectives.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there
&gt; &gt; &gt; are questions that are unresolved about the requirements.
&gt; &gt; &gt; E.g. the Scope discussion says "an upper ontology is
&gt; &gt; &gt; limited to concepts that are meta, generic, abstract,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ontology should include "semiotic concepts" or should
&gt; &gt; &gt; only include things that "really exist" in the world.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay, this seems to identify one of the main sticking points
&gt; &gt; for me personally, and I have only recently been able to get
&gt; &gt; enough of a pers-pective on it to barely begin to figure out
&gt; &gt; what the matter actually is.  It seems to be a bit like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I initially began participating in the various threads that have been
&gt; &gt; more or less dedicated to "Semiotics Formalization" (SF), I did not at all
&gt; &gt; realize the difference in perspective that existed between me and the rest
&gt; &gt; of the participants who were apparently quite interested in the
&gt; &gt; same topic.
&gt; &gt; In its critical points, as best I can see right now, after a long spell of
&gt; &gt; extremely puzzled reflection, the difference appears to be a bit
&gt; &gt; like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  One POV (that I am now guessing is the outlook of most KIF^n Cousins,
&gt; &gt;     Parolees of La Logique FOLie, and other participants in this e-agora)
&gt; &gt;     views the whole divided subject-matter of semiology/semiotics as not
&gt; &gt;     a whit more than "yet another subject matter" (YASM) for rolling up
&gt; &gt;     in the Universal Wrapper of their favorite Logic, whether the Goodies
&gt; &gt;     be candied, cyclamated, diet, filled, "lite",
&gt; &gt; NP-hard-or-soft-centered,
&gt; &gt;     saccharin, sugared, or whatever variety of confection they may confect
&gt; &gt;     to be wrapped-up in their bag.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  One POV (mine, perhaps other Perseans, byzantine, canonical,
&gt; &gt; or otherwise)
&gt; &gt;     quite literally views this semeiotic/semitotic zygote, the
&gt; &gt; homunculus of
&gt; &gt;     all future sense to be borne in time, as a more general
&gt; &gt; subject than logic --
&gt; &gt;     though perhaps more "primitive", more "rudimentary", more
&gt; &gt; "savage" (in the
&gt; &gt;     sense of 'La Pensée Sauvage' by Claude Levi-Strauss) would be
&gt; &gt; better words
&gt; &gt;     to use for its relationship to what we think "in" and "of" as
&gt; &gt; Formal Logic.
&gt; &gt;     In this light, this tool, or the brand of it that I
&gt; &gt; personally prefer to
&gt; &gt;     call the "pragmatic theory of signs" (PTOS) is the prior
&gt; &gt; instrument, the
&gt; &gt;     precursive methodology, the proto-organon that I use in order to study
&gt; &gt;     the more evolved dynamics and the more formalized implementations of
&gt; &gt;     logic itself, in whatever "language of the month" that it may happen,
&gt; &gt;     for the moment, to find itself flavored and wrapped up in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Have To Break Now,
&gt; &gt;
