standard-upper-ontology@ieee.org<BR><B>Subject:</B> SUO: Vote on Merged 
Ontology<BR><BR></DIV></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <BR>I vote NO. 
<P>Before commenting on the proposed ontology, I think it worth while to point 
out that, in my view, this vote is unnecessary and divisive.&nbsp; I think it is 
poor judgment on the part of the chair to call for votes on his own initiative 
and without discussion of the wisdom and timing of such a vote.&nbsp; It puts 
people in the difficult position of wanting to be supportive of work being done 
but having to say the work is not a satisfactory basis for a long term effort. 
<P>This situation could have been avoided by first determining that a vote was 
desired by the participants and before calling for a vote,&nbsp; clearly stating 
how the vote will be counted.&nbsp; I mean basic things like how many people are 
eligible to vote (at this particular time), who the eligible voters are (name), 
how the votes will be counted (e.g. does ABSTAIN count as NO), is a super 
majority (60%, 75%, etc.) required and how will a percent YES (or&nbsp; NO) be 
determined - as a percent of those voting or as a percent of those eligible to 
vote - is a quorum required, if so how large a quorum. 
<P>Standards organizations have carefully defined rules about voting.&nbsp; The 
rules vary among organizations and situations, but whatever they may be they are 
clearly stated.&nbsp; In many cases the rule is 75% of those eligible to vote 
and 75% of those actually voting must vote YES (ABSTAIN does not count as 
YES).&nbsp; This may or may not be appropriate for this group, but some clearly 
stated procedure is required. 
<P>Since there have been several statements that the IEEE is silent about voting 
procedures in this type of group, as a separate matter I will propose a set of 
voting rules for the group's consideration, comments, revision, etc. If the 
group can come to a general agreement on a particular procedure, then I will 
move that they be formally 
adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>I agree with the technical criticisms offered by Pat Hayes, John Sowa, Nicola 
Guarino and others about the specifics of this particular ontology.&nbsp; I also 
believe the technique of alignment / merger will not produce an ontology that 
will be widely accepted.&nbsp; This is in large measure the approach taken by 
Cyc and they have done it reasonably well.&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar approach, if 
done well, is likely to produce an ontology that is different , but about as 
useful as Cyc.&nbsp; If it is done well it will be costly and it&nbsp; seems to 
me this would be a waste of considerable resource. 
<P>I am not arguing that Cyc be accepted as "the" standard upper level ontology 
- Cyc already is the "standard" to the extent there is one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Doug Lenat (Cyc's CEO) offered his co-operation in one of the first messages 
posted to this list (I couldn't find this message in the archives).&nbsp; The 
Cyc upper level is not what I would prefer as an upper level ontology.&nbsp; It 
is what I recommend to clients that need one -- for commercial purposes, it 
really is the only game in town.&nbsp; It also has the considerable advantage of 
working with Cyc's lower level ontologies. 
<P>Doug is willing to convert to a "Standard" if a reasonable one is 
developed.&nbsp; I will quote a paragraph from a note I submitted to the list in 
May that I am also unable to find in the archives. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>In previous discussions with Doug, he has been willing to adopt 
  a standard reference ontology should one emerge.&nbsp; The caveats are (1) 
  that it is well constructed (2) that it enables Cyc to do things that it 
  currently cannot or cannot without great difficulty (3) that the expense of 
  adopting a new upper level be reasonable (4) and that the discernible 
  advantages to Cyc from (1),(2) &amp; (3) above are not marginal. (-- Doug, I 
  hope this is an accurate representation of your views.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe 
  this is reasonable and also sets a default as to what is worth doing.&nbsp; 
  Another upper level ontology about as good as Cyc or somewhat better would not 
  be</I> <BR><I>worth the scale of investment that I think will be 
required.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>The approach that I believe will produce a 
satisfactory result is along the lines of Nicola's suggestion that a small group 
of highly competent people meet to hammer out a basic philosophical / logical 
approach as a foundation for a computational artifact (an upper level 
ontology)&nbsp; that will be broadly useful and widely accepted.&nbsp; After 
(and only after) such an agreement can be reached,&nbsp; the concepts that have 
already been examined, described, defined/partially defined, axiomized, etc. can 
be properly placed in the new ontology. 
<P>This is not a merger of existing ontologies.&nbsp; It is the creation of a 
new ontology -- and where appropriate,&nbsp; using some of the content of 
existing ontologies in a principled way.&nbsp; If the concept(s) and its 
relation(s) have been considered for use in one ontology, the intellectual 
capital this represents is a huge advantage over starting from scratch, even if 
the concept is used differently or not at all.&nbsp; 
<P>A criticism of this method is that after 2500 years of disputation, it may 
seem overly optimistic to expect agreement on basic philosophical / logical 
issues - currently there are strong disagreements among well known, vividly 
articulate personalities.&nbsp; My response is to avoid attempting a resolution 
of basic philosophical issues by asking for agreement where possible; when 
agreement is not possible, compromise on the implementation of these issues in a 
way that doesn't do violence to deeply held beliefs.&nbsp; One is asking for 
agreement on the design of a computational artifact - not realism vs nominalism, 
etc.&nbsp; Newtonian vs relativistic physics might be useful as an 
analogy.&nbsp; Although one may know that the universe operates differently in 
fundamental ways, Newtonian physics solves the vast majority of problems 
encountered in anything like ordinary experience (including space travel&nbsp; - 
at least the travel done to date). 
<P>A first attempt at this approach was made at the Heidelburg Conference.&nbsp; 
This was a private, invitation only conference held at the European Media Lab 
located at the Villa Bosch in Heidelburg with generous support from the Klaus 
Tschira Foundation - a private German foundation that also supports the European 
Media Lab.&nbsp; The theory group was composed of people who are competent and 
well known in the field.&nbsp; Among them are some who have contributed to this 
list.&nbsp; The participants were chosen both for their competence and because 
they are well known to have strongly held and differing views.&nbsp; The idea 
being that agreement among them would have a chance of broad acceptance. 
<P>It is an understatement to say that ideas were challenged -- so was 
intellectual ability and parentage (among other things), people stormed in and 
out of meetings, furniture was broken...&nbsp; After about ten straight days (of 
10 to 12 hour days) an agreement was reached concerning many of the high level 
(and most difficult) issues.&nbsp; Much of what was agreed upon were what 
factors should be used (or not used) in a factored combinatorial structure that 
results in a lattice.&nbsp; This structure is somewhat similar to Formal Concept 
Analysis that was mentioned by someone in an earlier note to this list - however 
the discussion did not center on category theory vs set theory, etc. 
<P>This work needs to be fleshed out and it takes a serious effort that cannot 
be done on a volunteer basis.&nbsp; I am hopeful that funds will be available 
soon for this purpose.&nbsp; If so, it will be only a beginning. 
<P>Creating a standard upper level ontology - a reference ontology - will be 
costly,&nbsp; connecting it up to natural language (common English for starters) 
will be very costly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is naive to think otherwise.&nbsp; It is 
also naive to think that the proposed merged ontology can serve as a basis for a 
standard.&nbsp; However, it is important intellectual capital that should be 
encouraged and preserved.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>Bob <BR>&nbsp; </P>
