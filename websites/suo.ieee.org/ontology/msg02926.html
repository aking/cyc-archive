Jon --

Sorry I missed you before you left for vacation.  I have had to force
myself to abstain from the pleasures of the list, to focus attention on one
urgent piece of work.  This is painful for me, but sometimes necessary!

I mostly wanted to respond by saying that I am absolutely not an enemy of
ambiguity.  I had a long side debate with Graham Horn, when he seemed to be
advocating a form of controlled language for normal human discourse.  In
contrast, I revel in the infinite malleability of human language, as a form
of complex adaptive system, serving another variety of CAS - human social
systems.  I have read and written a lot of poems, and even published a few,
so in many ways I see ambiguity as a delightful and valuable attribute of
language.

In that context, my view of the enterprise of ontology, as exemplified by
this forum, is utilitarian.  Notice I dared to say &quot;context&quot;, but I don't
dare say &quot;pragmatic&quot;!  By utilitarian I mean that there are some human
purposes where clarity strongly takes precedence over evocativeness.  So,
while in part of my life I enjoy the creativity of ambiguity, in other
areas I am concerned with convergence on unanimity.  I'd like to be able to
talk about those purposes here, and the use of ontology as a tool for those
purposes.

&gt; Let me just add to John's note that my preconceived idea of the value of
&gt; ontology is precisely that of disambiguating utterances of various kinds

&gt; reference to a formal meaning framework.

Doug,

People keep saying this.  If you keep an eye out to watch what they do,
you notice a whole lot of contrary conduct going on in spite of it all.
I have gotten labeled, quite undeservedly, a &quot;big ambiguophile&quot;, simply
for continuing to point out the bare obvious fact that -- to invoke a new
twist an old parable, one so old, so 'in the pot' of our common knowledge
that it may be considered to be safely assured of a general understanding,
at least enough to blazon as the titles of books by otherwise outstanding
and scientifically respectable writers -- &quot;The Emperor Is An Xaddresser&quot;.

But I do not think that I like ambiguity any more than any body else --
at least, if I just knew for sure what it 'is' exactly, I am sure that
I would not like it, from all of the scathing remarks that so many
people make about it.  Anyway, I am sure that I do not like what
I call &quot;doubt&quot;, &quot;duplicity&quot;, &quot;uncertainty&quot;, and a legion or two
of other names, and I've been told that they are kin to this
vile ambiguity, or at least share their guilt by association.

So let me write about what I know, which is to say &quot;uncertainty&quot;.
And there I can quite safely say that I am decidedly &quot;agin it&quot;.

But still we have, or at least I see, that given the chance to
disperse their uncertainty, their &quot;irritation of doubt&quot; (IOD)
as C.S. Peirce dubbed it, people will often cling to it, all
in spite of every e-spousal that they most ostentatiously
ostend and most professedly profess.  Though I have tried,
just in order to 'get along', I cannot help noticing this.
And it strikes me as one of the most remarkable phenomena
that I have ever come a'X.

Being the inquiring sop that I am, I cannot help but to pause,
and reflect, and ask myself:  &quot;What might be the Xplanation of
this polymorphously perverse, contre-temporal transversality?&quot;
In plainer address:  &quot;What the Hecate is going on here!?&quot;

Simpleton that I was in olden days -- and I'm not all that much better now!
--
I tried to ask people straight out:  &quot;What is your meaning for 'meaning'&quot;
or
else &quot;What is your theory of 'theory'&quot;, and you know what happened, I only
got myself j'accused and guillotined for being a recursive agitator.  But
not every recourse to reflection is vicious, and I can testify to that.
Just f'r'instance this case of a genuinely reflective question, and yet
symbol-minded enough to answer in a perfectly straightforward fashion:
How many numbers are named in the following set of number expressions:
{&quot;3*4&quot;, &quot;5+7&quot;, &quot;12&quot;}?  The answer, of course, is &quot;one&quot;.

&gt; When I say utterances I include all forms of human-to-human discourse,
but
&gt; have a primary focus on domains of discourse that have a particular need
&gt; for clarity and agreement, and are expressed in a machine-processible
form.
&gt;
&gt; When I say disambiguating I am thinking of the usefulness of
&gt; both generality and particularity in the ontological utility
&gt; that is invoked in the process of disambiguation (POD).

Good one!

By the way, the acronym &quot;POD&quot; is standardly used
for &quot;professional and organizational development&quot;.
That 'all hash codes eventally crash' is well wot,
still that 'all signs are ultimately hash' is not.
The most general name for this process is &quot;inquiry&quot;.
The resource that nourishes its growth is &quot;information&quot;.
We shall see how the &quot;Folk Of Gaza&quot; (FOG) welcome within
their blithèd sight the Seeing or Seers of these 2 &quot;i&quot;'s.

&gt; Generality along the lines of &quot;When I say 'account' I mean in the sense
of
&gt; a monetary ledger, not in the sense of a customer&quot;.  Particularity along
&gt; the lines of &quot;When you say 'account', do you mean checking account or
&gt; savings account&quot;?
&gt;
&gt; I'm thinking the distinction between an account
&gt; as a kind of ledger and an account as a way of
&gt; referring to a customer might be within the
&gt; scope of something close to an upper ontology.
&gt;
&gt; The distinction between a savings account and
&gt; a checking account would be the province of
&gt; an ontology for financial institutions.
&gt;
&gt; Or, maybe even the first distinction is outside of the
&gt; upper zone, and might only be found in an ontology of
&gt; business that exists somewhere midway between an upper
&gt; ontology and a more specific ontology for a type of
&gt; business.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey

P.S.  I have already unsubbed from the SUO List,
      and all of the Archives seem to be stuck,
      so I am flying, blitzlessly, blind today.
      I am contemplating continuing all future
      conversations on the &quot;Ontology&quot; Sublist.
      Cheers, indeed ...
J.A.
