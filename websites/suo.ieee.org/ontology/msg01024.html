Jim,
It seems to me that we were told there were no IEEE rules for voting in a
working group.   Could you give me a pointer to the documentation for this
(default) rule mentioned in your Observations (1) below.

&gt; SUO,
&gt;
&gt;         Final vote results on Merged Ontology (see ballot question below)
&gt; are:
&gt;
&gt;         YES = 11
&gt;         NO  = 9
&gt;         ABSTAIN = 4
&gt;
&gt;         YES votes were from: John Thompson, Adam Pease, John Velman, Graham
&gt; Horn, Roberto Bordogna, Ian Niles, Douglas McDavid, John Sowa, Fredrick
&gt; Chase, Frank Farance, Jay Halcomb.
&gt;
&gt;         NO votes were from: Matthew West, Chris Partridge, Robert Kent,
&gt; Stefano Borgo, John Dickert, Francis McCabe, Lee Auspitz, Bob Spillers,
&gt; Chris Angus.
&gt;
&gt;         ABSTAINs were from: Pat Hayes, Michael Uschold, Sofia Pinto, Nicola
&gt; Guarino
&gt;
&gt;         Please correct me if I have tabulated your vote incorrectly.
&gt;
&gt; Observations:
&gt;
&gt; 1. The IEEE default voting rule within a working group is a simple majority
&gt; of YES vs. NO votes, with ABSTAINs not included in determining majority.
&gt;
&gt; 2. This vote was presented as an unofficial straw poll, because we are
&gt; currently establishing the list of official voters.
&gt;
&gt; 3. We previously established considerable opposition to calling the Merged
&gt; Ontology a "Base Document," and have since modified the question to remove
&gt; this label.
&gt;
&gt; 4. All comments that were directly related to the question have been posted,
&gt; and received much discussion.  Some votes did change as a result of
&gt; discussion and are reflected in the above results.  Those comments that
&gt; related to improving the document were not to be addressed until and unless
&gt; the group decided to work on this document.  This is the way ballot
&gt; resolution works.  We try to improve documents and build consensus by
&gt; resolving comments.
&gt;
&gt; 5. This is a very early-on vote in the development of the proposed document.
&gt; It will eventually need to gain 75% approval from the final balloting group.
&gt;
&gt; Proposed Conclusions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. A simple majority voted YES to the question (copy below), therefore, this
&gt; vote has passed, but by a recognized thin margin.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Aside from the thin approval margin, the group appears to have rather
&gt; strong consensus that work should proceed on the Merged Ontology.  This
&gt; comes even from many of those who voted NO, who did so for the reasons in
&gt; the posted comments.
&gt;
&gt; Proposed Actions resulting from above:
&gt;
&gt; Step 1: Post link to Merged Ontology on SUO web site at <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org">http://suo.ieee.org</A>.
&gt; as follows:
&gt;
&gt;         Documents under development by this working group:
&gt; 1. Merged Ontology &lt;link address&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Step 2: Select a Technical Editor for Merged Ontology document, to be
&gt; accomplished by issuing a 'Call for volunteers' followed by an open and fair
&gt; selection process.
&gt;
&gt; Step 3: Place Merged Ontology Document under control of SUO WG, requiring
&gt; Technical Editor to gain approval from group before making changes.  This
&gt; would be mostly via an informal consensus process, but would also include
&gt; formal votes (with comment resolution) every 3-6 months.
&gt;
&gt; Step 4: Technical Editor will resolve all comments from the previous vote
&gt; that dealt with improvements to Merged Ontology.  Additional comments will
&gt; also be solicited.
&gt;
&gt;         Are there any objections to these Observations, Proposed
&gt; Conclusions, or Proposed Actions?

&gt; The completed call for vote follows:

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; From: Schoening, James R CECOM DCSC4I
&gt; [<A  HREF="mailto:James.Schoening@mail1.monmouth.army.mil">mailto:James.Schoening@mail1.monmouth.army.mil</A>]
&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 18, 2001 7:03 AM
&gt; To: Standard-Upper-Ontology (E-mail)
&gt; Subject: SUO: Revised Call for Vote on Merged Ontology
&gt;
&gt; SUO Participants,
&gt;
&gt; 1. Since the prior vote had a variety of problems, it is amended as follows
&gt; to focus on the key question.
&gt;
&gt; 2. If you have already cast a vote (and received acknowledgement) you don't
&gt; need to vote again, unless you wish to change your vote or comments.
&gt; However, this is an open list and all are welcome to post or repost their
&gt; opinions.
&gt;
&gt; 3. This message is a call for a vote on the question:
&gt;
&gt;         Should the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology Working Group
&gt;         commence work on the Merged Ontology as posted by
&gt;         Ian Niles with the intent of attempting to develop
&gt;         it into a final standards document?
&gt;
&gt; 4. Background:  If this vote passes, this document will change from being
&gt; the work (and under the control) of a group of individuals to being the work
&gt; (and under the control) of the SUO WG.  A Technical Editor will need to be
&gt; appointed or elected, who will need group approval before making changes.
&gt; This does not require frequent formal votes for every change. A better
&gt; approach for daily or weekly updates is to develop consensus by resolving
&gt; objections, as we did when revising the Scope and Purpose.  In other words,
&gt; the editor posts a suggested change and asks for any objections. Items that
&gt; do not have clear consensus would be accumulated.  Then, every 3-6 months
&gt; the group could have a formal vote on what would be the next 'Working
&gt; Draft.' Comments would be submitted and resolved before approval as the next
&gt; Working Draft.
&gt;
&gt; 5. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of consensus we have
&gt; for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need to decide if we
&gt; are going to go down this path or not.  A working group may decide to work
&gt; on more than one document, so anyone else is free to submit one.
&gt;
&gt; 6. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose improvements to the
&gt; document, unless they are major enough for you to vote against focusing work
&gt; on this document.  However, such general improvement comments are welcome
&gt; and will be resolved (but not unless and until the vote passes.  There would
&gt; be no sense in resolving comments if the group does not want to proceed with
&gt; this document.).
&gt;
&gt; 7. Since we are still in the process of establishing official voting rights,
&gt; I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw poll, such that
&gt; anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if consensus is not
&gt; clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote (once voting
&gt; rights are established).
&gt;
&gt; 8. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), NO (comments
&gt; required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt;
&gt; 9. You may send your votes either to me or to this reflector.
&gt;
&gt; 10. Please vote by Feb 1, 2001.

&gt; Chair, SUO WG
