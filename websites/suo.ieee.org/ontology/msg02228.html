&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I too am dismayed by the volume of discussion and the sense that 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;although individual contributors have benefited from the discussion, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and a rather small group is making progress on an ontology, that we're 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not working together and making collective progress on a standard.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe you should learn from this observation, rather than regretting it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just because we haven't yet found success is no reason to think it 
&gt;&gt;impossible.  What lesson would you have me learn, and how should that 
&gt;&gt;lesson follow from the SUO experience?
&gt;
&gt;That there are genuinely divergent and incompatible views on many 
&gt;ontological issues, and that consensus cannot be achieved by any 
&gt;simplistic approach of trying to merge or conflate them by simply 
&gt;inserting them into a single overarching classification. That 
&gt;reconciliations between divergent views are best achieved by looking for 
&gt;mutually acceptable mappings between them, rather than by choosing one 
&gt;over the other.  That a generally useful ontological classification should 
&gt;be based on an attempt to discover orthogonal categories from which a 
&gt;useful lattice can be constructed, rather than on an ad-hoc initial tree, 
&gt;no matter how carefully based on some philosophical agenda.
&gt;All of which, by the way, we concluded in 1998 in Heidelberg.

You hold a different opinion than I do and I must assert that it is simply 
a different opinion, rather than a truth that any reasonable person should 
learn.  You may be right.  I might be right.  Time will tell.  Some 
reasonable people came to one conclusion in Heidelberg.  Other reasonable 
people can hold a different opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe that the solution is not improved document management or 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;better tools but rather for folks to be specific and concrete in 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;developing a formal document expressing their preferred version of an 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;upper ontology.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think it is simply a reflection of a fact of life: people do not agree 
&gt;&gt;&gt;on ontological issues. They never have and they never will. Regretting 
&gt;&gt;&gt;this is like regretting that people speak different languages. My mum is 
&gt;&gt;&gt;sternly disapproving of the fact there there are people on the planet 
&gt;&gt;&gt;who don't naturally speak the Queen's English, an attitude that rather 
&gt;&gt;&gt;reminds me of yours towards the variety displayed on this very list.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't you think that a better attitude to this fact might be to find a 
&gt;&gt;&gt;way to utilize it, rather than try to 'solve' the 'problem'?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Not at all.  People disagree when there is reason to do so,
&gt;
&gt;People disagree for all kinds of reasons. I don't think the disagreements 
&gt;that have been revealed on the SUO list arise from any *need* to disagree. 
&gt;They arise from genuinely divergent, often deeply felt, convictions about 
&gt;the nature of reality, the appropriate way to describe it, and so on. You 
&gt;seem curiously unable to appreciate that there even are such differences.

Again, not at all.  I do appreciate that there are many different ways to 
model general ontologicial issues.  I simply believe that reasonable 
compromises and agreements can be made.  The motivation is that if people 
do agree then their software will be able to communicate effectively 
without the need for translation.  Maybe French is really the best language 
for communication but English, Spanish and Swahili are all adequate.  If 
there's a reason to agree on a common language (and my opinion is that 
there is such a reason), people will agree.

&gt;Maybe it would help if you were to state explicitly what your basic 
&gt;assumptions are about the SUO and the methodology that you and Ian are 
&gt;adopting towards creating it. For example, you seem to assume that all 
&gt;reasonable people can be made to agree, or at least their axioms can be. 
&gt;Do you think this is correct? (If so, why?)

Yes.  I take Cyc as a reasonable existence proof even though it may be an 
imperfect one.  I also think that the way you've characterized Ian's 
methodology in the sentence below is an oversimplification, and therefore, 
as a strawman, easy to dismiss as insufficient.

&gt;  You sometimes seem to think that just by translating axioms into a 
&gt; common logical notation, they will somehow come to be mutually 
&gt; compatible. You seem to think that the exact definitions of the terms in 
&gt; the concept heirarchy are not all that important, and are really only 
&gt; hooks to hang things on. Are all these impressions correct?

no, this is an oversimplification.  There's considerable actually editing 
and alignment that Ian has done.  The work has not simply been translation 
into KIF.

&gt;&gt;and find ways of agreeing when there is reason to do so.  In the KIF 
&gt;&gt;working group we have a compelling need to agree on a common language and 
&gt;&gt;semantics for the language.  We might each have our preferences, but 
&gt;&gt;we're willing to give up certain preferences here and there in order to 
&gt;&gt;reach consensus.
&gt;
&gt;Well, you introduced the example, so let me respond. First, KIF is a 
&gt;language, not an ontology, so there is lot less to disagree about. Even in 
&gt;that severely limited domain, and that relatively small group, we managed 
&gt;to discover at least three basic, irreconcileable differences in 
&gt;viewpoints, as you may recall. We have indeed managed to find a route 
&gt;through this particular minefield, but only with the greatest care and by 
&gt;some of the group agreeing to bow out of the discussion and leave it to a 
&gt;smaller subgroup to thrash out the details. And only 2 weeks ago, we 
&gt;discovered that we had been talking at cross purposes over such a basic 
&gt;notion as what constitutes a sorted language for the previous six months, 
&gt;and were obliged to redefine our overall goals as a result. We once spent 
&gt;several wseeks arguing over the exact from of the BNF for 'identifiers'. 
&gt;If the KIF group is a microcosm of the SUO effort, then the SUO is doomed.

Another difference of opinion I think.  In KIF we're creating a foundation 
and with that foundation in place I think there will be less flexibility 
for difference on the ontology.  A great deal of misunderstanding happens I 
feel because we're talking in ambiguous English.  Once people get to the 
point of being willing to state theories as formal axioms, I think 
resolution on many issues will be quicker.  I also should add that it is 
the highest levels of the ontology which are the hardest.  I've found 
progress in practice on application level ontologies to be much faster and 
so I think we'll see a dramatic acceleration in progress as agreement on 
upper levels is reached.

&gt;&gt;We don't all need to agree on every aspect of the SUO.  We merely need to 
&gt;&gt;have a product we can accept as a result of a lot of give and take.
&gt;
&gt;The product that Ian is creating will never be acceptable to me, under any 
&gt;circumstances.

I'd hope that you'd keep a more open mind, and allow the possibility that 
you've misunderstood the methodology, or that the methodology may turn out 
to be a reasonable one, or that a flawed methodology might still yield an 
acceptable result.

&gt;  I say this not in any way as a criticism of Ians work, but as a comment 
&gt; on the overall methodology. I have tried to make my reasons for this as 
&gt; vividly clear as I possibly can, ever since I first saw the first draft 
&gt; of the ontology. If you still don't understand them then I am at a loss 
&gt; as to how to communicate them to you.

I believe I understand your opinion.  I don't find it totally 
unreasonable.  Jim Hendler seems to have a similar view about the need to 
have many alternate ontologies.  I respect that view and feel that I can 
support Jim on his project with work that is consistent with his 
goals.  However, I disagree with that particular opinion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you believe something specific is lacking in the Merged ontology 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that Ian has been working on, suggest a new axiom, or set of terms.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Adam, speaking for myself, the major source of frustration is that 
&gt;&gt;&gt;people do not seem to read what one writes. Have you actually understood 
&gt;&gt;&gt;anything of what I wrote about what is wrong with the overall 
&gt;&gt;&gt;methodology of Niles' effort? It cannot be cured by adding more bits to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;it, any more than tossing a few more vegetables into a stew is going to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;turn it into a souffle.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I've read your comments and I simply don't agree with your 
&gt;&gt;criticisms.  Maybe I don't yet fully understand them.
&gt;
&gt;Well, if you don't agree with them, maybe you could actually answer them? 
&gt;Prove me wrong.

Sigh.  We may just have to agree to disagree.  You've given many opinions 
and asserted them as if they were facts.  I've tried to answer your 
criticisms and provide justification for my opinions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If some folks would prefer EXIST or some other basis for the standard, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;then offer concrete extensions to it using the EBNF syntax defined for 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it.  Formalisms without explanation or discussion may make it difficult 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for some folks to communicate but discussion without formalisms will 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lead us simply to more talk.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I would like to applaud those folks who have been very concrete (and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;forgive me for those who I have forgotten): Helena Sofia Pinto for 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;contributing an ontology of units and measures, Nicola Guarino and his 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;colleagues for their work on mereology, Pat Hayes for his detailed and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;specific help on temporal axioms, Chris Menzel, David Whitten and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Robert Kent for their work on the "structural ontology". We should also 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;thank John Sowa, Achille Varzi, Roberto Casati, James Allen, Barry 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Smith, Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig and all the unattributed 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;contributors to the Ontolingua repository.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If everyone on this list would create just some small ontology of even 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a dozen terms supported by axioms that has not yet been covered in the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;merged ontology, we could make tremendous progress.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;No, we would simply have a larger and even more confused stew. The 
&gt;&gt;&gt;axiomatizations would be incompatiable with each other and would be 
&gt;&gt;&gt;based on sharply different views of the world. Surely this is vividly 
&gt;&gt;&gt;clear from the postings on this list? Matthew West's axioms would talk 
&gt;&gt;&gt;of 4-d entities and be based on a solid physical nominalism; Lee 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Auspitz' axioms would assume a tensed ontology and would take human 
&gt;&gt;&gt;experiences as their basic framework. Others would write axioms which 
&gt;&gt;&gt;transliterate one of several different kinds of English grammatical 
&gt;&gt;&gt;theory. We even seem to disagree on what words like 'set' and 'class' mean.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;You have thanked me for my contribution on temporal axioms, but I wish 
&gt;&gt;&gt;you would not, since I regard the temporal axioms in Niles' document as 
&gt;&gt;&gt;a crock, and would refer that my name not be associated with them. There 
&gt;&gt;&gt;is no single generally useful axiomatization of time: that is why I 
&gt;&gt;&gt;wrote a temporal CATALOG, setting out the ALTERNATIVES and noting the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;ways they were INCOMPATIBLE with each other. I did that for a reason, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;not because I couldnt think of anything else.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;We may disagree on English terms but I'm not clear on which axioms you 
&gt;&gt;disagree with.
&gt;
&gt;Asking me to disagree with individual axioms is like answering someone who 
&gt;criticises Windows 98 to cite a particular line of code they don't like. 
&gt;It just misses the point. Its not that I disagree with any axioms in 
&gt;particular, but that they disagree with each other.

Then point out some axioms which disagree with each other.

&gt;Look, surely it is obvious that one cannot expect, just because people are 
&gt;using a common logical langauge, that they are automatically agreeing with 
&gt;each other?

I haven't claimed that.

&gt;On what grounds would you *expect* to be able to 'merge' ontologies 
&gt;written by different people about different subject-matters, with 
&gt;different philosophical or pragmatic or mathematical agendas, so that they 
&gt;fit together into one framework? This entire ambition strikes me as close 
&gt;to insane. Is your experience of the world really so limited that you have 
&gt;never come across divergent points of view? I managed to find about 20 or 
&gt;so incompatible points of view just on temporal orderings.

I've never said that people can't hold different points of view, just that 
compromise and agreement is possible.

&gt;Let me turn the point around. Show me some nontrivial consequence of the 
&gt;axioms in the merged ontology that you think illustrates its utility, and 
&gt;that uses axioms from several different sources. Let me give you an 
&gt;example to get things started: try inferring that if there is a hole and 
&gt;that some fluid stuff is moving into the hole and the hole doesn't get 
&gt;smaller, then the stuff must be going somewhere. That should involve 
&gt;holes, time and fluids, and maybe pathways.

That's a neat example, and one I'd be happy to work through.  I'm likely to 
make mistakes the first time around or two since I haven't been working on 
all the details of the Merged Ontology.  Also, you'll have to grant that 
the Merged Ontology is a work in progress and that even in this example, 
we're likely to find concepts which are incomplete, underdefined or 
missing.  I think what we're trying to accomplish with this exercise is to 
zero in on parts of the ontology that which are somehow incompatible with 
each other.  Since I think that finding an unsolvable incompatibility is 
unlikely, I'll hope to have the result that we flesh out some missing 
concepts which Ian can include in a new version of the ontology.

I'll respond to this in a separate post.

&gt;Or take a few combined concepts. Suppose that someone wants to describe a 
&gt;subclass of human beings, those who are related to a British citizen in 
&gt;some way that gives them the right of abode in the UK (a *very* sensitive 
&gt;issue in UK politics, by the way). What kind of ontological description 
&gt;would be used to describe such a class? (The legal definition was changed 
&gt;a number of times, so that the answer is highly connected with the time 
&gt;the request was made. Just a heads-up about the kind of issues that are 
&gt;going to come up.) Heres another: the notion of an insult. What *kind* of 
&gt;thing is an insult? Which hook would you suggest hanging it on? (Similarly 
&gt;slander/libel/offense/apology...)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In fact, although you've said often that you consider the current merged 
&gt;&gt;ontology "incoherent" or, as above, that there are sections that are 
&gt;&gt;"incompatible" with one another, I don't believe you've given a precise 
&gt;&gt;characterization of what you mean by those words.
&gt;
&gt;I can't give you a LOGICAL definition. What I meant is that various parts 
&gt;of the ontology are written with different, and incompatible, assumptions 
&gt;in mind. The 'foralls' in one part of the ontology range over different 
&gt;universes than those in other parts, for example. I have already 
&gt;documented several of these cases, but the point is that with this 
&gt;methodology such clashes are inevitable.

I'd submit that if there isn't a precise logical definition, then what we 
are arguing about is just the 'incompatibility' of intent of knowledge 
authors rather than any actual incompatibility of their axioms.  I'd 
certainly grant that virtually any concept can be fleshed out more and that 
until axiomatized, it is likely that different authors would have different 
imprecise intent for their chosen elaborations.

&gt;I have another problem with the current merged ontology, which is that its 
&gt;basic class distinctions don't make sense to me and aren't properly 
&gt;documented,and seem to form a tree, which is wildly unsuitable for any 
&gt;complex reasoning. I notice however that you have a much more casual, 
&gt;ready-to-hand attitude to conceptual classification than I am comfortable 
&gt;with. You use "Sign", for example, in ways that would I suspect make a 
&gt;true-born P**rcian cringe (whatever it is, it is inherently triadic, so 
&gt;classifying a novel as an instance of Sign has got to be a mistake. Maybe 
&gt;one particular event of reading a novel might qualify?), although as I 
&gt;have no idea what it means I am not really qualified to judge. On the 
&gt;other hand, I will never, to my dying day, use an ontology that requires 
&gt;me to categorize Hamlet as an instance of Sign.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Do you mean that the current ontology is logically inconsistent? If so, 
&gt;&gt;let me issue a friendly challenge: show a proof using the axioms in the 
&gt;&gt;merged ontology which leads to a contradiction.  Let me issue an even 
&gt;&gt;stronger challenge since if there are in fact any contradictions I 
&gt;&gt;suspect we can fix them
&gt;
&gt;That is like saying that if I find any holes in the airplane you can patch 
&gt;them.  Even if it were true, it doesnt make for good engineering.

It's more like saying that while the Wright brothers are building the 
plane, for the first time, that they can be confident they'll fix any flaws 
and would appreciate any help in making the plane fly.

&gt;&gt;: show two proofs leading to contractions for which any fixes would 
&gt;&gt;generate more contradictions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This could also include domain-specific ontologies as the exercise of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;linking such ontologies to the merged ontology will elucidate the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;general areas that need to be developed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;How about a practical semiotics of books, recordings and documents;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Would it take a book to be a semiotic text with a physical encoding, or 
&gt;&gt;&gt;a physical object (a continuant or a 4-d lifetime?) to which contentful 
&gt;&gt;&gt;relations can be applied, or a kind of 'sum' of a physical entity plus a 
&gt;&gt;&gt;nonphysical 'text', or a collection (what kind of collection?) of 
&gt;&gt;&gt;surfaces bearing information-encoding marks, or...? (Please don't say 
&gt;&gt;&gt;'all of these') Some people think of books as things with a history, 
&gt;&gt;&gt;like old furniture.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;These are exactly the sort of questions the author of an ontology of 
&gt;&gt;semiotics should ask, and answer.
&gt;
&gt;On what grounds should they be answered one way rather than another? All 
&gt;are perfectly fine answers, for some purposes. A book is one thing to a 
&gt;bookbinder, another to a librarian, another to a publisher, and still 
&gt;another to a copyright lawyer, and yet something else to a freight line 
&gt;operator. None of them are *right* and the others *wrong*. They are all 
&gt;perfectly good, but subtly incompatible, views.

If they're all fine answers then just pick one.  The only problem would be 
if reasonable choices on different areas of the ontology cause some 
fundamental incompatibility.  I doubt that will occur and haven't seen any 
evidence that it will.

&gt;&gt;That they have not been answered in this discussion group should not 
&gt;&gt;suggest that they can't be answered satisfactorily.  Since you've asked, 
&gt;&gt;let me attempt an answer.
&gt;
&gt;Im sure that an answer CAN be given. My point is that other answers can 
&gt;also be given, and the SUO cannot possibly legislate some out of court and 
&gt;others in.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'll call on Ian to correct any erroneous connections that I may make 
&gt;&gt;with the merged ontology (given below as a term with an initial capital).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A book is a physical object with a lifetime - subclass of VariableObject
&gt;
&gt;Why  Variable?

See <A  HREF="http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;skb=Merge&amp;id=80">http://ontology.teknowledge.com:8080/rsigma/SKB.jsp?req=SC&amp;skb=Merge&amp;id=80</A>
"A ContinuousObject whose physical properties may nonetheless vary..."

&gt;&gt;A book is related to the "conceptual work" which is the information 
&gt;&gt;content of the text in the book.
&gt;
&gt;What about encyclopedias, collections of poetry, dictionaries, and diaries?

While it would be good to have more specialized cases of ConceptualWork to 
cover these items, they still seem to fit at least in the informal English 
definition I've given above.

&gt;&gt;A conceptual work is a ContentBearingObject (it may more specifically be 
&gt;&gt;a Sign).
&gt;
&gt;I think this is wrong, since a ContentBearingObject is a physical entity 
&gt;which also bears information (last time I checked).

good point

&gt;&gt;A conceptual work has temporal extent, at least one author, and no 
&gt;&gt;physical extent.
&gt;
&gt;Not all works have authors.

While alternate formalizations are certainly possible and reasonable, what 
I'm intending (which points to my earlier comment about discussions 
converging once formalized) is that any such work does have at least one 
author.  Dictionaries and encyclopaedias have authors.  Were you thinking 
of a different counterexample?

&gt;&gt;A particular coding of the conceptual work is also a Sign.
&gt;&gt;A book contains a particular coding of the conceptual work.
&gt;
&gt;What distinguishes a book from a videotape or a CD?

They'd all be VariableObjects but we'll certainly over time need to develop 
more specific classes for electronic media which would be further 
specialized with magnetic media.
