&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your very interesting note.
&gt; 
&gt; You wrote:

&gt; &gt; | In spite of the apparent duality between these patterns of
&gt; &gt; | composition, there is a significant asymmetry to be observed
&gt; &gt; | in the way that the insistent theme of realism interrupts the
&gt; &gt; | underlying genre.  To understand what this means, it is necessary
&gt; &gt; | to note that the strain of pragmatic thinking I am using here takes
&gt; &gt; | its definition of "reality" from the word's original Scholastic sources,
&gt; &gt; | where the adjective "real" means "having properties".  Taken in this sense,
&gt; &gt; | "reality" is necessary but not sufficient to "actuality", where the word
&gt; &gt; | "actual" means "existing in act and not merely potentially" (Webster's).
&gt; &gt; | To reiterate the same thing from the converse direction, actuality is
&gt; &gt; | sufficient but not necessary to reality.  The distinction between
&gt; &gt; | the two ideas is further pointed up by the fact that a potential
&gt; &gt; | can be real, and that its reality can be independent of any
&gt; &gt; | particular moment in which the power acts.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by the last phrase "in which the power acts".(?)

I was drawing on the erstwhile synonymy of "power" and "potential",
for which the common Greek word was "dynamis" -- it is, for example,
in this sense that one was probably meant to understand the ancient
notion that "knowledge is power", id est, "potential", which you can
get some inkling of from reading Aristotle's linking of all of this
stuff and such together in his treatise 'Peri Psyche', or 'De Anima',
or 'On The Soul', however you choose to read it.

&gt; To see if I understand your discussion, let's consider as an example,
&gt; "the Higgs boson".  It is a hypothetical particle, predicted to exist
&gt; in a model of subatomic particles developed by Peter Higgs.  We don't
&gt; know if it exists or not, but if it does exist it would have certain
&gt; properties.  Within the next few years, experiments may give evidence
&gt; for its existence.
&gt; 
&gt; So, according to your definitions, does this mean that the
&gt; Higgs particle is "real", even if it does not "exist"?

Okay, we have already got ourselves into at least two different
orders of potential here.  One is the ordinary sort of physical
potential, of which any particle is, according to one brand of
physicist, just a convenient, but a highly derivative fiction --
and, of course, there is the complementary brand of physicist
who says that it is precisely the other way around -- anyway,
this potential is real, probably in spite of the fact that we
are presently describing it rather imperfectly, and real to the
extent that "something (X) is going on there", something that will
keep on thumping us in the head until we are quick enough to grasp it,
until we get punch-drunk from trying, or until we are dead from failing
to do so, if it does indeed turn out to be important to our continued
existence in the "form of life" (FOL) to which we would most likely
like to remain accustomed.  That is just the nature of reality,
as I have learned to respect it, anyway.

But now there is yet another sort of potential that you are raising,
our potential to know how things are, our power to gain knowledge,
or ability to hit upon a moderately correct theory of the world.

The relationship between those two sorts of potentials,
and the more frenetic kinetics that is consequent on
their dynamics, is what my work of the, let's say,
past twenty to thirty years or so, has been about.

There are most likely some common principles and representations that can be
applied to describe any process of change, development, evolution, whatever,
through any sort of configuration space, phase space, state space, whatever,
whether we are talking about states of physical being or states of knowledge.
There is a lot of work to be done just gearing up the logical or qualitative
styles of static description into their more kinetic and dynamic extensions,
to the point where they are up to the level of representational power that
we currently enjoy in quantitative realms.  Of course, all of that is just
the beginning of what needs to be done, before we can begin to talk about,
I mean, in a sense-making way, stuff like "intelligence" and "knowledge"
as if they were genuine agent-&amp;-system-theoretic "properties of state".

&gt; [...]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, you see, reality is not a matter of taking the summit,
&gt; &gt; in ever-widening gyres of contest and context, in a futile
&gt; &gt; game of one-up-man-ship -- and yes, for some reason, it is
&gt; &gt; prototypically and schematically just men -- but of being
&gt; &gt; subject, of exemplifying the properties that one holds.
&gt; 
&gt; Just to be clear, I do not view this as a game of one-up-man-ship.
&gt; I'm asking questions just to learn, and perhaps contribute to the
&gt; development of SUO.

No, that was just invoking a "personalistic" analogy,
with a joke on the side, of course, but the serious
part of what I am trying to say here has to do with
some lessons that I learned, the hard way, as usual,
about this "pragmatics as a theory of context" notion
that Charles Morris first began to propagate way back
in the 30's, as a half-baked explanation of what Peirce
meant by his full-fledged theory of signs -- but this
particular story goes back fifteen years or so in my
own proper time (Tau SubZero), and so I had probably
better save it for another time.
