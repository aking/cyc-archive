Matthew,

Just a few comments dispersed below.

&gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have visited your "neck of the webs" several times,
&gt; &gt; but I tend to get lost in it because the frame system
&gt; &gt; does not let me leave a suitable trail of "bread crumbs" --
&gt; &gt; The sight of all those pyramids gave me a start at first --
&gt; &gt; I tend to think "yet another hierarchy" (YAH) when I see
&gt; &gt; contemplative edifices like that -- especially when I read
&gt; &gt; further that their "foundations" are on "top", but still,
&gt; &gt; I am attracted to almost anything that tries to get the
&gt; &gt; "ground" off the "plane", so I persisted.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here is the trail that I followed, such as I can record:
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note:  My fairly up-to-date NetScraper cannot read the pages
&gt; &gt; that are displayed by the "EDMvisualExpress WEB publisher".
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  There is a ZIP file you can download with an HTML version
&gt; of the model.  Have you tried that?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I am currently working with others on an update to that model
&gt; which should both simplify and enhance its capability.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay, bactrack, and continue ...
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Yep this is home for the integration architecture stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And finally I get to here:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | Mattheew West,
&gt; &gt; | "SO/WD 18876-1 Integration of industrial data
&gt; &gt; | for exchange, access, and sharing --
&gt; &gt; | Part 1:  Architecture overview and description"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this the right place?  At least one of them?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Yes.  Another one to try to find is the SC4 Data Architecture
&gt; Preliminary Work Item page, where you should be able to find links
&gt; to "Some notes on the nature of things" and the EXIST language,
&gt; amongst other things.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is some interesting looking stuff here,
&gt; &gt; especially the pictures, but I am presently
&gt; &gt; obstructed in the reading of it by the fact
&gt; &gt; that I no longer know who in this group uses
&gt; &gt; words like "class", "union", "intersection",
&gt; &gt; and so on, in the ways that I am used to use
&gt; &gt; them and who is not -- maybe you are, I just
&gt; &gt; cannot be sure anymore.  So this would take
&gt; &gt; some clarification if I was to try to get
&gt; &gt; any deeper into the architecture of it.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Class, a set to which we attach some significance.

Okay, good.  I believe that this admirable notion of
"a collection to which we attach some significance",
under any other name, is one that we definitely need
to keep in mind, and to which we ought to pay rather
a bit more of additional and concentrated attention.

But, just by way of allowing us to keep on talking
to logicians and to mathematicians -- you know how
they are! -- and by way of avoiding the inevitable
confusion that is bound to follow from using these
terms at odds with the way that they already do --
we must be flexible since they obviously cannot --
let me just suggest that we look around for another
way to describe our sense of the significant object.

I am not yet sure if this would work -- we will just
have to see -- but it may be feasible to forge a not
too confounding and too entangling link with the not
unrelated topic of "natural kinds" if we contemplate
using the word "kind" to describe the brand of class,
the type of set, or the cast of a class in such role
as you appear to have in mind here.  Let us try fora
bit and see, may we, just as a kind of an experiment?

If that brand of compromise does not work out, then
we may have to seek out an altogether new neologism --
if you will excuse my tautologism, and I think that
you know how much I would hate to have to do that!? --
for example, in the latest cast of my 'dissipation'
I have been using the phrase "indexed set" to speak
of a reasonable facsimile of this very notion, that
is to say, one that portrays a verisimilar ilk tuit.

&gt; MW:  Union, the usual set theory definition.  The set whose members are
&gt; a member of one set, and or the other that you are making the union of.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Intersection, the set whose members are members of both sets that are
&gt; being intersected.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you have time to provide a little exposition
&gt; &gt; on what you mean by the "derivation" dimension?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  a set/class whose membership can be defined in terms of
&gt; other sets and perhaps particular objects.  An easy example
&gt; is a class that is defined in terms of the intersection of
&gt; two other classes, e.g. red cars.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks In Prospect,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
