&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A really small, niggling point.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You wrote:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think what Matthew may have been talking about are
&gt; &gt; &gt; cases where something might have an intermittent existence.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This isn't plausible for physical things, but there are some
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasonably intuitive examples."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that it can be plausible for some kinds of physical objects.
&gt; &gt; Wouldn't it be better to say that we normally do not think of physical things
&gt; &gt; as having intermittent existence.  But that there are examples.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I agree.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I seem to remember someone mentioning the polar ice cap in one
&gt; &gt; SUO message (apparently it sometimes melts away completely).
&gt; &gt; Another geographical example would be rivers that run dry.
&gt; 
&gt; In locales where such rivers are common, however,
&gt; there is a rather different way of talking about them:
&gt; they are called 'sloughs' or 'washes' (in the SW USA)
&gt; and I believe 'wadis' in Arabia, and the name refers
&gt; to the dry bed rather than to what we would call the
&gt; river;  the thing we would call a river is simply
&gt; a wash filled with water, a condition which is
&gt; more like an occurrent than a continuant.
&gt; (Camping in a wash for shelter is a famous
&gt; bad decision made by visitors to the desert.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that my car's front right wheel is a physical object
&gt; &gt; (though some might want to relegate this to a role - whatever that it is) -
&gt; &gt; over the life of my car, this wheel has had an intermittent existence.
&gt; 
&gt; Really?  Do you mean that the wheel has been changed?  If so, I'd say
&gt; not that the wheel's existence was intermittent, but that there had
&gt; been several wheels.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The substantive point behind this - for me - is that temporal continuity
&gt; &gt; is good requirement for identity (temporal unity) but unfortunately not
&gt; &gt; an absolute rule.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I basically agree, although I think the spatiotemporal contiguity rule
&gt; is pretty good for physical objects almost all the time.  The exceptions
&gt; are where the object has a geographical way of being identified (the big
&gt; lump of ice at this position, when it is there) and it is easier to keep
&gt; the geographical identification than the continuity one, especially since
&gt; spatiotemporal continuity doesnt coincide with substance continuity for
&gt; these things anyway.  (Contrast the case where someone stole Stonehenge
&gt; and replaced it with a very good replica made of authentic stone.  Most
&gt; people would still make the distinction and call the second one a fake.)

Pat &amp; Pat,

A really small, indeed, a micro-physical point:
You seem to be ignoring all of that stuff in
high-energy physics and quantum mechanics,
about the different kinds of statistics,
specifying what types of particles are and
what types of particles are not indistinguishable
from each other, subject only to group symmetry laws,
about interpretations of QM in which positrons are
just electrons travelling backwards in time,
and so on, not to mention the rub of making
sense of "physical continuity" atoll at
a microphysical level, ad finitum, ...

So would it not be better just to formulate
the logical definitions of these properties,
if you can, or to borrow them from folks who
already have, if you can find them, and let
the chips of the actual physical world fall
where they may, as gathered by experiment?

Just A Thought,

Jon Awbrey
