WIS Discussion.  Note 11

FK = Frances Catherine Kelly
JA = Jon Awbrey

Re: WIS Discussion 10.  <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg05309.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg05309.html</A>

Copied here:

FK: What is basically being driven at here by me is that the
    literal or written notation of logical relations signifies
    a polarity of correlates in a ground that is identified.

JA: Can you give me examples of things that fall under the following descriptions?

    1.1.  &quot;literal or written notation&quot;

    1.2.  &quot;logical relations&quot;

    1.3.  &quot;literal or written notation of logical relations&quot;

    2.1.  &quot;a polarity of correlates&quot;

    2.2.  &quot;a ground that is identified&quot;

    2.3.  &quot;a polarity of correlates in a ground that is identified&quot;

JA: Can you show me how your example of a thing that
    falls under description 1.3 has the property
    that it &quot;signifies&quot; some example of a thing
    that falls under description 2.3?

FK: The information in the ground of the relation
    here seems dyadic, as any such relation will be, ...

JA: Why do you say that &quot;any such relation&quot; will be dyadic?
    What are the assumptions about &quot;such&quot; that would cause
    you to assert this?

Frances,

I am looking for some answer to the questions that I asked last time.

FK: This is not to be evasive, but since my (unfamiliar?) jargon is slowing debate
    on the original topic of what information is that a sign may bear it, allow us
    for comfortable economy to substitute it with common words in ordinary language.

FK: As for examples of notations that might fall under
    my neological descriptions, there are several posted
    by listers including yourself on the Peirce List going
    back about a year on the themes of relations, relatives,
    identities, teridentities, and others.  These would serve
    our purposes.

1.1.  &quot;literal or written notation&quot;

The notations that I've seen before are rather diverse.
It would be helpful to settle on some concrete examples.

1.2.  &quot;logical relations&quot;

Though I have a sense of what I'd mean if I wrote &quot;logical relations&quot;,
I don't have a sense of what you mean when you write that, so I could
still use a little bit of clarification as to what you mean by that.

1.3.  &quot;literal or written notation of logical relations&quot;

That leaves the composite clause still up in the air,
not to mention the rest of the questions.

FK: My curiosity remains on your original claim that
    when speculative information in a sign that is given
    uncontrolled to sense is reduced to its logical atom
    in mind, to decrease ambiguity from the outside world
    and to increase certainty that might allow thinkers to
    deal more assuredly with that world, the information is
    thereby transformed into a syntaxic construct wherein
    its formal subsigns refer to other formal subsigns,
    instead of to objects external to those subsigns
    or that construct.

Can you tell me specifically what I wrote that you interpret by
means of the phrases:  (1) &quot;speculative information in a sign&quot;,
(2) &quot;given uncontrolled to sense&quot;, (3) &quot;reduced to its logical
atom in mind&quot;?  I think that I can recognize traces of my story
in the clause about decreasing ambiguity to deal more assuredly
with the world.  However, I still need to ask how you got from
something I wrote to what you wrote here:  (4) &quot;the information
is thereby transformed into a syntaxic construct wherein its
formal subsigns refer to other formal subsigns, instead of
to objects external to those subsigns or that construct&quot;.

When you write &quot;subsigns&quot;, do you mean (a) syntactic components of
compound signs, or (b) subclasses in some classification of signs?

FK: This would make the sign situation a polemic relation of
    logical subsigns and a 2-adic structure, which defies the
    Peircean requirement that any sign situation be 3-adic and
    refer to sign-objects other than the sign-vehicles themselves
    for some interpretant sign-effects.

Can you give me a concrete example of this &quot;2-adic structure&quot;?

FK: In the mean time, my cryptic vocabulary will be cleaned up,
    and a deeper search of Peircean passages on the topic will
    be sought.  Your leads to archived messages by the way are
    much appreciated.

FK: On my crudely stating any relation as &quot;such&quot;
    by the way, the intent is simply to mean any
    relation is a 2-adic structure in my opinion, ...

To say that &quot;any relation is a 2-adic structure&quot;
sounds just plain wrong to me.  Can you say why
you believe this?

FK: On my crudely stating any relation as &quot;such&quot; by the way, the intent is
    simply to mean any relation is a 2-adic structure in my opinion, yet
    one that has some vague &quot;semantic&quot; object between the two &quot;syntactic&quot;
    poles that together lay in a common &quot;semantic&quot; ground, and one that
    is identified by some &quot;pragmatic&quot; agent external to the relation.
    It is this agent that tends to correctly and necessarily make
    any relation a 3-adic construct, which satisfies Peircean
    semiotic criteria, but ironically defies the 2-adic nature
    of all relations.

FK: This is the thorn for me when reducing informative grammatic signs
    to purely syntaxic situations.  The broader implication here is
    that grammatical syntax in symbolic logic would be held as a
    1-adic or 2-adic construct.  My tentative solution for any
    identified relation is to make its &quot;ground&quot; one pole and
    the &quot;agent&quot; the other pole, thereby yielding from an
    explicit and overt trident an implied covert duality.
    It also seems that in the absence of an identifying
    agent external to the ground and the relation,
    that there can be no relation, but only
    separate unrelated sign-vehicles.)

Again, you refer in passing to the &quot;2-adic nature of all relations&quot;.
Perhaps it would be best to focus a while on this particular &quot;thorn&quot;
of a notion, which I can assure you is quite lacking in justification.

Jon Awbrey
