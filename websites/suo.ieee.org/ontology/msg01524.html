Doug,
   I don't follow you.  What portion of that text indicates a goal of 
separate modules for the *upper ontology*?  That quote merely says that 
other ontologies which are domain specific can be built off of the SUO.

&gt;Nicola,
&gt;    Neither the approach of a single common ontology, or a catalog of
&gt;related ontologies has been proven to be the right approach, so either or
&gt;both may turn out to be valid.  However, I would say that a single common
&gt;ontology, to the degree practical, is the goal of this group, and has been
&gt;voted on when the PAR was approved.  I have found that there can be
&gt;disagreement on wording that I thought was very clear, but the sections
&gt;that seem to indicate this are (with my emphasis by bracketing with '*'s):
&gt;
&gt;"This standard will specify *an* upper ontology that will enable
&gt;computers..."
&gt;
&gt;"The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange format whereby owners
&gt;of existing applications will be able to map existing data elements just
&gt;*once to a common ontology*."
&gt;
&gt;The group is of course free to change its mind...
&gt;
&gt;I would say that Cyc falls somewhere in the middle on this issue and I
&gt;suspect that will be the result for the SUO as well - a largely common
&gt;ontology with a context mechanism that allows for a few different, although
&gt;compatible, approaches in limited areas.

&gt; &gt;Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         I am sorry not having been able to enter this discussion so far,
&gt; &gt; but I totally agree with your point. Especially in this phase, clarifying
&gt; &gt; the different views and relating them each other is much more important
&gt; &gt; than attempting at a unifying ontology. In the future, a library of
&gt; &gt; reference ontologies (or a reference ontology library?) can grow out of
&gt; &gt; this effort. I don't exclude that, ultimately, one single ontology will
&gt; &gt; attract most of the consensus, but this can only be proved by monitoring
&gt; &gt; actual use, not on the basis of a priori arguments.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         In any case, I believe that the purpose of our effort is not to
&gt; &gt; force people (and computers) to think in the same way, but rather to be
&gt; &gt; clear about the meaning and the implications of what they think. Suppose
&gt; &gt; we have a well-designed ontology library, where each module is adequately
&gt; &gt; axiomatized, and a number of primitives are in common, so that mappings
&gt; &gt; and comparisons can be made among the different axiomatizations. Now
&gt; &gt; suppose that application 1 commits to reference ontology RO7, and
&gt; &gt; application 2 to RO2: the utility of this (wrt to the absence of a
&gt; &gt; reference ontology library) is in the fact that i) RO7 and RO2 are
&gt; &gt; "certified" as reflecting the view of a group of people of a certain
&gt; &gt; minimal size, with certain applications in mind, who have developed these
&gt; &gt; ontologies by adopting a controlled methodology; ii) the formalization of
&gt; &gt; RO7 and RO2 allows to establish (partial) mappings and understanding the
&gt; &gt; differences. This is a concrete step towards integration.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         Notice that a reference ontology library would be different from
&gt; &gt; a  simple repository of ontologies (like for instance the one maintained
&gt; &gt; on the Stanford Ontology Server) inofar each SUO module would be
&gt; &gt; "certified" for soundness, clarity, existence of a suitable number of
&gt; &gt; potential applications, existence of a certain level of common agreement,
&gt; &gt; and existence of (partial) formal links with other modules.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         I believe that the level of agreement on this issue ­ monolithic
&gt; &gt; vs. non-monolithic approach ­ is suitable to be checked by means a vote.
&gt; &gt; As I have noted in the past, a vote on issues like this one makes much
&gt; &gt; more sense, at this stage, than a vote on an initial "merged" ontology.
&gt; &gt; So I ask James to call for a vote on this. According to my notes, besides
&gt; &gt; the people mentioned by Matthew, also Chris Menzel, Chris Welty, Robert
&gt; &gt; Kent, Frederick Chase, and Philip Jackson have expressed their preference
&gt; &gt; for a non-monolithic approach.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         I hope this helps. I'll continue digesting the (many dozens)
&gt; &gt; unopened messages now...

&gt; &gt;&gt;It occurs to me that some may be a little confused about what all the
&gt;fuss
&gt; &gt;&gt;is about. There has been a very lively discussion about how we should
&gt; &gt;&gt;construct an SUO, with a large number of sub-plots, the result being that
&gt; &gt;&gt;you could be forgiven for being confused about what the discussion is
&gt; &gt;&gt;actually about.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;This at least is my version.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;There are a number (say about 4-5) of world views that are documented,
&gt; &gt;&gt;either in natural language, or in a more formal form, with a number of
&gt; &gt;&gt;possible variations on these.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Ian and his supporters argue that because all philosophers do not agree
&gt;on
&gt; &gt;&gt;just one of these, we should ignore all of them, giving preference to a
&gt; &gt;&gt;process that Ian might describe as pragmatic selection from various
&gt;sources
&gt; &gt;&gt;and merge.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I, Pat Hayes, John Sowa, Chris Partridge, Nicola Guarino (please correct
&gt;me
&gt; &gt;&gt;if I am mistaken) and perhaps others would argue that we would be better
&gt; &gt;&gt;served by understanding the existing World Viewpoints and relating them
&gt;to
&gt; &gt;&gt;each other.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Discussion
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;As far as I can see there are four possible outcomes to Ian's approach.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;1. Ian solves the problem that previous philosophers have failed to solve
&gt; &gt;&gt;and creates a single ontology that everyone agrees is how the world is.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;2. Ian recreates one of the possibilities that are already known about.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;3. Ian creates a new ontology with a different world viewpoint than those
&gt; &gt;&gt;already existing, adding one more to the list that philosophers don't
&gt;agree
&gt; &gt;&gt;about.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;4. Ian fails to create a consistent ontology.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Let us consider these in turn:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;1. Included for completeness only. I don't think Ian expects this
&gt;outcome.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;2. One of the two most likely outcomes, in which case it would be more
&gt; &gt;&gt;efficient to do some homework and make an informed choice (or adopt the
&gt; &gt;&gt;counter position above).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;3. A remote possibility, and probably the least useful.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;4. The most likely short term result, based on what I read and my own
&gt; &gt;&gt;experience, getting to a consistent universal ontology from scratch takes
&gt; &gt;&gt;some 5-10+ years work -- for those few who can claim some measure of
&gt; &gt;&gt;success.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;The alternative approach:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;- Recognises that there are a (small) number of major world
&gt; &gt;&gt;   viewpoints that exist and are valid (within some range).
&gt; &gt;&gt;- Tries to understand explicitly what are the elements that
&gt; &gt;&gt;   underpin those viewpoints and the applicable range.
&gt; &gt;&gt;- Identifies key choices that are mutually exclusive.
&gt; &gt;&gt;- Documents those viewpoints based on that understanding.
&gt; &gt;&gt;- Enables interoperation between those viewpoints by
&gt; &gt;&gt;   mapping between them.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;We could of course pursue both of these options.
