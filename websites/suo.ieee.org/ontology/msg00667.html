&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew, thanks for this. Trying to capture your POV again:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. A spatio-temporal object (alias a spatio-temporal extent) 
&gt; is something
&gt; in the real world, and can be represented at least in part by 
&gt; a constant.

MW: I would say it represents the whole of the activity, i.e. it is a
surrogate for it. The constant does not represent the relationships the
activity has, but then the relationships the activity has are not the
activity in the real world either.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. An activity is something in the real world.

MW: Therefore.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent
&gt; 
&gt; 4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the 
&gt; real world, but
&gt; if you are qualified to study advanced topics you may wish to consider
&gt; representations of relations in the real world)
&gt; 
&gt; 5. From 1 and 3 it follows that an Activity can be modelled 
&gt; in part by a

MW: in whole rather than in part.

&gt; constant. An activity can be modeled more fully by the union 
&gt; of a constant
&gt; and relations containing that constant.  The example is modelled using
&gt; multiple dyadic and triadic relations.

MW: The relations represent the actual relationships of the activity, not
the activity (see above). It is worth noting that in KIF constants are
declared implicity, not explcity, so you do not come across a constant until
you want to say something about it.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Attempting to model a activities as a single n-adic relation may be
&gt; adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
&gt; between systems, and by implication for the SUO.

MW: Correct.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that I have followed my principle of trying to use the 
&gt; singular case
&gt; (e.g. Activity rather than Activities).  I find this is a 
&gt; very powerful aid
&gt; to achieving precision.

MW: My preference too. some times I am sloppy.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I ever hope for alpha-plus?  Yours, Martin

MW: We are well into alpha-plus territory here.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew, your answer below is rather longer than I expected.
&gt; &gt; To precis my
&gt; &gt; understanding of your POV.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 0. A spatio-temporal object is something in the real world, 
&gt; and can be
&gt; &gt; represented by a constant.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. A spatio-temporal extent is something in the real world, and is
&gt; &gt; different from a spatio-temporal object.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I must have been sloppy here. spatio-temporal extent == 
&gt; spatio-temporal
&gt; object
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. An activity is something in the real world.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the 
&gt; real world
&gt; &gt; unless you are qualified to study advanced topics)
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Actually not even then. But representations of them might.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5.  Activities can be modeled as relations.  The example is
&gt; &gt; modelled as
&gt; &gt; multiple dyadic and triadic relations.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Yes, but it is preferred (by me at least) for an activity to be
&gt; modelled
&gt; as a constant, which then participates in a number of 
&gt; relations, as I set
&gt; out, where these relations indicate those things which play a 
&gt; role in the
&gt; activity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 6. Attempting to model a activities as a single n-adic 
&gt; relation may be
&gt; &gt; adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
&gt; &gt; between systems, and by implication for the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Yes
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How am I doing so far?
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Pretty good.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dear Martin,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I note this is just us. If that is an accident feel free to 
&gt; post this
&gt; &gt; thread.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I try to be careful to match representation form to what they
&gt; &gt; represent, so
&gt; &gt; I recognise a spatio-temporal object as something that first
&gt; &gt; exists in the
&gt; &gt; real world, and second has a consistent representation in the
&gt; &gt; information
&gt; &gt; world, so as a constant such as a, b, c, fred, etc. A 
&gt; spatio-temporal
&gt; &gt; analysis of activities in the real world reveals them to be
&gt; &gt; spatio-temporal
&gt; &gt; extents. They consist of the temporal parts of the objects
&gt; &gt; that are playing
&gt; &gt; a role in the activity. Thus I expect them to be represented as
&gt; &gt; spatio-temporal objects, i.e. by a constant, as above.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actual relationships exist in the same way that actual
&gt; &gt; classes do. They are
&gt; &gt; abstract objects that are out there that we can take an
&gt; &gt; interest in and use
&gt; &gt; to organise and think about the world. Actual relationships
&gt; &gt; are what one
&gt; &gt; thing has to do with another. I note that a relation like:
&gt; &gt; &lt;purchase, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;
&gt; &gt; does not represent a relationship, but actually a number of
&gt; &gt; relationships
&gt; &gt; that each element of this construct has to an object that is
&gt; &gt; not part of,
&gt; &gt; but may be inferred from this construct.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So in analysis I look for recognition of this. I would
&gt; &gt; analyse the above
&gt; &gt; into:
&gt; &gt; &lt;Purchase a&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;Purchaseof a b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;Datetimeof a 12:15-12th-August-1999&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;lawnmower b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;HondaCB250 b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;hasprice HondaCB250 c&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;GBPvaluemap c 500&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Or something similar. So I have extracted and represented the actual
&gt; &gt; relationships.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not that there is anything wrong with the original data 
&gt; structure in a
&gt; &gt; purchasing system, but you do have to extract what it means
&gt; &gt; if you are to
&gt; &gt; make that available without everyone having to learn the
&gt; &gt; language of every
&gt; &gt; other system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does this provide an answer?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards

&gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew, recently you very usefully challenged me about
&gt; &gt; whether I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about the real world or representation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Below you say inter alia "I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent". and then "activities are frequently
&gt; &gt; &gt; modelled as
&gt; &gt; &gt; relations".  I think it would help many of us if could you
&gt; &gt; &gt; clarify your
&gt; &gt; &gt; view for each of activity, relation, and spatio-temporal
&gt; &gt; &gt; extent, which you
&gt; &gt; &gt; regard as being in the real world, and which are
&gt; &gt; &gt; representations used for
&gt; &gt; &gt; modelling?

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear John,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This doesn't help us much. In particular it doesn;t answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question we
&gt; &gt; &gt; started with, which is "Is an activity a relation?" where at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least Pat,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris P and I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; would feel uncompfortable that a relation was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent. On
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hand many others note that activities are frequently 
&gt; modelled as
&gt; &gt; &gt; relations. Perhaps it is OK to do both, in which case is this
&gt; &gt; &gt; inconsistent?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or does it just not matter?
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew, Mike, et al.,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is a very serious and very difficult question:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is in the real
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;world that they refer to?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Java, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; refer to in the real world?" all hell breaks loose.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suggestion:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     let's not worry too much about what it is.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     the position that KIF is the official language to be used
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same cop out that Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tractatus:  "Everything that can be said can be said clearly,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent."
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the SUO] can be said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speak [in KIF], thereof we must be silent.
