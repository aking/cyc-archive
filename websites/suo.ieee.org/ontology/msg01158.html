Jim,
<br>I share Lee's concerns regarding these issues.
<p>However I wish to discuss issues about the vote itself and what, if
anything, it means.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not clear from Robert's Rules of
Order&nbsp; that the vote should be counted by the method you used - particularly
how the ABSTAIN votes were counted.&nbsp; It is a possible interpretation
- Robert's calls for counting of all the votes cast and determining a majority
of the YES vs NO votes with blank votes not counted.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this
circumstance is an ABSTAIN vote a blank vote?&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it requires
comments, I think it is not a blank vote.&nbsp; Reasonable people can disagree,
but it is not clear how the rule should be applied.
<p>It is unwise to wait until the vote is taken to announce the method
and authority used to determine the results.
<p>Robert's rules were not designed for this sort of vote and the&nbsp;
interpretation of this particular issue is murky.&nbsp; Clearly most standards
efforts strive for a broad based consensus and usually require 75% of those
eligible to vote (effectively a quorum) and 75% of those actually voting.&nbsp;
ABSTAIN whether counted as NO or not does apply to the calculation of 75%
of those actually voting.&nbsp; (In your call for a vote ABSTAIN was listed
as a possible voting choice with attendant requirements - i.e. comments
required.)
<p>Regardless of how the vote was counted, other provisions of Robert's
Rules were not observed.&nbsp; In particular the making of motions and
call for a vote on the&nbsp; initiative of the chair.&nbsp; I do recall
someone raising a point of order.
<p>This vote was then characterized as a "straw vote" and not an "official"
action of the group.&nbsp; I have no problem with an expression of opinion.&nbsp;
I do have a problem if the chair then announces his "Proposed Conclusions
and Actions" as a result of the "straw vote".&nbsp; It appears to be an
official action of the WG.
<p>Reference to "a" or "one" <u>unofficial </u>document being worked on
by some members of the WG,&nbsp; more accurately reflects the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is Niles (Teknowledge?) work and he is completely in charge of how it
proceeds.&nbsp; If he agrees to be bound by the consensus of the WG and
do the work of technical editor, I applaud him - it is very useful work.&nbsp;
An "official" appointment as "technical editor"&nbsp; is unnecessary and
inappropriate.&nbsp; It appears to put a stamp on something that has not
been formally agreed to.&nbsp; I have no objection to informal arrangements.
<p>Once again I wish to point out that I believe this vote to be unnecessary
and divisive.
<p>In your note of 2/13/01 titled " SUO: Proposed Conclusions and Actions
from Vote" you asked if there were any objections.&nbsp; I object.
<p>Bob

<blockquote TYPE=CITE>Jim,
<p>Maybe you or some ome of the other experts in IEEE procedure in our
ranks
<br>could clarify what is going on here.
<p>First you posted several topics as needing consensus before we
<br>proceed. What is the status of the consensus on these topics?&nbsp;
Does it
<br>warrant plunging ahead before developing a greater consensus?&nbsp;
I strongly
<br>think not.
<p>Second, you responded to Graham Horn that it was wrong for a single
<br>organization, no matter how large and influential, to claim multiple
<br>votes. Yet of the 11 Yes votes I count at least three from Teknowledge
<br>just the number needed to assure a majority.&nbsp; Wasn't there some
celebrated
<br>case in IEEE involving bloc voting by a single company (as opposed
to
<br>individualized participation in the case of the Boeing participants)?
<br>[This is the kind of problem I tried to suggest in noting the limitations
<br>of the "material interest" criterion for the peculiar character of
the
<br>SUO.]
<p>Of course this is only a straw vote, and everybody good humoredly followed
<br>your request for it, your revision of it, your launching of discussion
of
<br>the comments, and now your declaration that we can put it all behind
us on
<br>the basis of Roberts Rules of Order. Before following this next turn
I
<br>think it would be prudent to ask you to summarize the status of consensus
<br>on the discussion points you proposed and to assure that the agreement
on
<br>them is sufficient to make it productive to plunge onward. Otherwise,
the
<br>next round of reviews will not be more favorable than this round, or
you
<br>may find active participation limited to the point of diminishing
<br>legitimacy. The array of talents on this list is very impressive for
the
<br>job at hand, and good advice has been proffered by seasoned hands.&nbsp;
It
<br>would be a pity to see all this squandered.
