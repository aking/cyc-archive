&gt; Pat,
&gt; I saw your note on the SUO list regarding alternate ontologies.  You are
&gt; obviously correct about the impossibility of getting everyone to agree
&gt; on a "single coherent upper level ontology". I do think it is possible
&gt; to create a single upper level ontology - a standard Reference Ontology
&gt; (RO) - that a vast majority of users would find acceptable.  To be
&gt; successful,  the RO should be implemented as a software artifact on a
&gt; widely known (university, research institute, etc.) server, declared to
&gt; be fully in the public domain and completely free.

Bob-

Your concerns about free public availabiliy have been addressed by IEEE -- they are willing to make it free.

&gt; Even though alternative ontologies can be "equally valid and coherent,
&gt; even though they differ from one another" the Reference Ontology would
&gt; widely accepted if it is well constructed, serves most user purposes and
&gt; is free.  If the RO is not widely adopted it should be considered a
&gt; failure regardless of  its intellectual merit.

Agree, lack of adoption is a failure attribute.
 
&gt; Correspondingly, if the alternative "standard" ontologies are not widely
&gt; adopted they should also be considered failures (both individually and
&gt; in the aggregate) regardless of their intellectual merit.  I don't wish
&gt; to demean intellectual merit.  An ontology might have considerable
&gt; intellectual merit and be of great value to a small group of users -
&gt; especially if they are researchers - but not be of value to a wide
&gt; audience.  The failure is their inability to become a "standard" in the
&gt; sense of reaching  a large enough and diverse enough audience.  The
&gt; imprimatur of any standards organization (IEEE, ANSI or ISO, etc.) will
&gt; not matter if there is not wide acceptance.

One of the features of working in a standards committee is that many participants with "material interest" can come together to improve the work and to increase further adoption.

&gt; I don't believe the SUO group is likely to create a standard upper level
&gt; ontology if "widely adopted" is part of the meaning of standard. The
&gt; notes posted indicate that participants have many and differing agendas
&gt; - intellectual, commercial, and  personal.  However, it is possible that
&gt; the group will create something that gains the imprimatur of a standards
&gt; group.

I disagree.  It is contradiction to state "wider participants will produce lower adoption" and then "lower participation gets wider adoption".  How do you plan on getting wider adoption if you are not satisfying the needs of the broader audience?  The only time this works is when one can force this via a proprietary (but common) solution upon the market place.  I don't believe this is possible with SUO.

&gt; In a (much) earlier note to the SUO list I suggested that CYC should be
&gt; considered the default SUO.  They have a working ontology that is the
&gt; best known and most widely used.  Of course, everyone would have
&gt; constructed CYC differently - and, I suspect, different from each
&gt; other.  Reasonable people may disagree with many aspects of CYC but I
&gt; don't think one can reasonably argue that it is not well thought out and
&gt; created on a scale much larger than other general purpose ontologies.

It would be great if CYC and/or other participants were to contribute their work for adoption, integration, and harmonization.

&gt; If one cannot create a general purpose upper level ontology that is
&gt; significantly better than CYC then the effort should stop.  An ontology
&gt; that is about as good or somewhat better than CYC is not worth the cost
&gt; (which will be large).  I believe such an ontology can be created, but
&gt; not easily and not by volunteer labor.

I agree that things should not be created from scratch, especially when there are good solutions that may be reused.  However, even if the CYC work is adopted, standards work is still required to finalize the document and to maintain/update the doucment.

&gt; Some of the subscribers to this list will know that I have pursued the
&gt; goal of a Reference Ontology for a number of years. The difficulty has
&gt; been that the cost is large and the result (to be widely adopted) must
&gt; be entirely free. I am still optimistic about both the ability to create
&gt; a Reference Ontology that will be widely accepted and to fund such an
&gt; effort.

As I've said in prior E-mail, I believe volunteer activities are possible to complete this work in SUO.
