Dear Matthew,

Thanks very much for this clarification.

Best Regards,

&gt;
&gt; Dear Philip,
&gt;
&gt; Below you suggest that EXPRESS has been proposed as an alternative to KIF.
&gt; This can only be supposed to come from me, so in case others
&gt; think this too,
&gt; let me say plainly that I do not propose EXPRESS as an alternative to KIF
&gt; for the purpose of developing an SUO. It happens I have some
&gt; useful content
&gt; that is defined in EXPRESS, and I think it is useful to expose people to
&gt; content in a "foreign" language so they can understand how difficult it is
&gt; for those of us who are not native KIF speakers to read and write KIF, but
&gt; that is all.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;       Matthew

&gt; Subject: SUO: Some Procedural Suggestions
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Jim, and all,
&gt;
&gt; Once again I will jump into the fray with a few comments and
&gt; suggestions for
&gt; how to proceed.
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me that SUO has been making progress, yet three central issues
&gt; are unresolved:
&gt;
&gt; 1) What are the objectives for use of the SUO?
&gt;
&gt; 2) What are the requirements for the SUO?
&gt;
&gt; 3) What are the requirements for the language(s) in which the SUO will be
&gt; represented?
&gt;
&gt; Before we can decide what language to use we need to agree on the
&gt; requirements for the language. The requirements for the language depend on
&gt; the requirements for the SUO, which depend on the objectives for the SUO.
&gt;
&gt; Much of the discussion in SUO seems to involve these issues while
&gt; trying to
&gt; make progress on theoretical questions related to the SUO itself. There
&gt; needs to be a consensus on these issues before people can agree about the
&gt; value of any proposed candidate for the SUO, or any proposed
&gt; elements of an
&gt; SUO, though efforts such as Ian Niles' "merged ontology" are valuable at
&gt; least as strawmen to help identify issues.
&gt;
&gt; The objectives of the SUO are addressed briefly at the SUO website, in
&gt; sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, though questions still arise
&gt; about the objectives.
&gt;
&gt; Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in
&gt; the sections
&gt; on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there are questions that are
&gt; unresolved about the requirements. E.g. the Scope discussion says
&gt; "an upper
&gt; ontology is limited to concepts that are meta, generic, abstract and
&gt; philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether the ontology should
&gt; include "semiotic concepts" or should only include things that "really
&gt; exist" in the world.
&gt;
&gt; The SUO website lists KIF or the simplified version as the
&gt; proposed language
&gt; for the standard, without giving a discussion of the requirements for the
&gt; language. We have proposals for alternative languages (e.g. EXPRESS), and
&gt; ongoing discussions about some of the requirements for the language. E.g.
&gt; does the language need to include reflection, does it need to represent
&gt; semiotic concepts, does it need to be a programming language?
&gt; Which elements
&gt; of an SUO should be built into the language, and which should be expressed
&gt; using the language? Does it need to be a higher-order language or
&gt; should SUO
&gt; be expressed at the level of first order predicate calculus, etc.?
&gt;
&gt; Many such questions have already been addressed at one time or another in
&gt; email threads among the participants. Yet it appears that there
&gt; is no way to
&gt; determine what has been resolved or agreed about these questions (and what
&gt; is still unresolved) without reviewing all the email correspondence, which
&gt; is not practical.
&gt;
&gt; To address these issues, I recommend that the SUO participants take a
&gt; standard software engineering approach, and collaborate on development of
&gt; concise yet complete requirements specifications for the SUO and for its
&gt; language.
&gt;
&gt; These requirements specifications should be located on the SUO
&gt; web site and
&gt; should be working documents that are iteratively developed, starting with
&gt; the current statements of scope and purpose. I'd recommend that these
&gt; specifications be presented in a "requirements outline" format, where each
&gt; requirement or issue is very concisely stated in a single sentence, and
&gt; sub-requirements and issues are added as the group develops them.
&gt; Hyperlinks could be used to give more complete discussions of the
&gt; requirements, issues and resolutions, with pointers to the email
&gt; correspondence about them. We may need to have votes about specific
&gt; requirements, to resolve their status.
&gt;
&gt; The precise format of the requirements outline is not important, but it
&gt; should be something that is very concise yet complete. E.g.,
&gt; something like
&gt; the indented table of contents outline for a standard FAQ would be useful.
&gt;
&gt; Also, email correspondence could try to follow a standard of having the
&gt; specific requirement or issue identified in the email subject line, in a
&gt; standard way, so that people can easily see which requirements and issues
&gt; are being discussed, find other relevant email, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, it is clear that there are distinct differences of opinion among
&gt; the participants about the answers to questions related to
&gt; requirements for
&gt; the SUO and its language. Indeed, questions about requirements are
&gt; "inevitably intertwined"* with theoretical questions about the design and
&gt; implementation of the ontology, and with theoretical questions about
&gt; ontology and knowledge representation in general. On some of
&gt; these questions
&gt; we may not reach consensus, and the SUO effort may need to "fork" and
&gt; explore alternative answers. This would allow progress to be made on
&gt; multiple paths when it is not clear to everyone which is the best path to
&gt; pursue.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt;
