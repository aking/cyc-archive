Jon, 
	.	I believe you try to be far too complex too soon.  

	.	We are at the start of a significant project akin to a baby
learning about life. The difference is that we have been trained in
language, logic, etc to far greater extents than a baby. That means we can
develop the structures far quicker if we apply ourselves. 

	.	Of all the fads you followed, have you ever catalogued the
stumbling blocks, and looked at how others got past them? I suspect
different projects stumbled at different points. 

	.	Furthermore, I suspect that insufficient application was
applied to overcome the quandaries. If you're so sure they're doomed, how
about demonstrating actual cases, and showing where they got to, and points
they COULDN'T get past? 

	.	I'm not a fantasiser, and respect true show­stoppers.
However, I have succeeded at what others have assured me were impossible
numbers of times before. It was by developing solutions to problems others
gave up on, or else finding pragmatic ways to bypass them. 

	.	A key aspect of the sort of system that will work for this
project's sort of purpose is absolute pedantry in the implementation.
Otherwise, of course, one loses the unambiguity quality we require. Many
people don't have that sort of patience or persistence. 

	.	Another aspect is that, when a structure turns out to have
significant shortcomings, such as the ether theory in physics, then one has
to abandon previously developed structures incompatible with an alternative
structure that overcomes the identified weakness.  

	.	To me, your approach is akin to the physicists and
astronomers of this world having given up and said: "It's all too puzzling,
so we're going to abandon our work." 

	.	Well, they're still at it, despite many abandoned "fads". 

	.	So are the software developers who have to take similar
approaches to provide additional features incompatible with their previous
structures. Not all of them are Microsofts either. 

	.	This is why your songs don't ring true. 

	.	Give me examples that are truly insuperable, and then I'll
stop until I find a practical way round.

&gt; What I believe you are forgetting is that the core of

&gt; are very stable, and strikingly similar, even from very
&gt; different roots.
&gt; 
&gt; The motility you speak is mainly around the edges.
&gt; We don't have to deal with that till much later.
&gt; 
&gt; If we can capture the stable core of information/knowledge

Graham,

I cannot imagine what it was in my initial note,
offered by way of proposing to Jim and the group
a parallel strategy for possibly productive work,
by focusing on problems rather than straw targets,
that evoked the tune of "Ord Lang Syne" in your mind.
But on that same theme, and to that same tune, let me
thank you for the trip down Memory Lane -- I took a look
at IDEF #5 at the site that you sent me -- <A  HREF="http://www.idef.com">http://www.idef.com</A> --
and it really has a lil' something for everyone, don't it, though!? --

| A little bit of EPAM in my life,
| A little bit of ELINOR by my side. 
| A little bit of FRAN all I need, 
| A little bit of Flowchart all I see. 
| A little bit of EURISKO in the sun, 
| A little bit of STELLA all night long.

I am really looking forward to seeing the whole dog'n'pony act
on "Antique Roadshow" anytime soon.  You note that I have gone
back to being subtle.

More seriously, Graham, I kept up with just about
all of the new dance crazes that hit the charts
in AI, CogSci, Computational Learning, DataBases,
Discovery Programs (No, not the Disney Channel),
Language Design, Logic Programming, and all-around
Theory of Computation -- between 1982-1992, when
I finally got tired of the cyclic nature of most
of the fads and decided to go back to work on the
fundamental mathematical tools that it would take
to beat the band.

I do not like using the progressive fallacy jazz,
but you are the one who used the word "modern",
like so many do, as if it were a guarantee of
not only freshness, but truth and utility,
so I feel obligated to fight pop with pop.

The sample of the "IDEF Five" that I saw is
very typical of the the sort of hip hop mix
that I was very hype to in the middle Disco
years, and the very sort of thing that made
me quit the band.  But thanks for the LTM.

With respect to your off-key note on Nat Lang,
the thing that you have constantly ignored is
what every school child in formal linguistics
since the early days of Chomsky, if not before,
learns along with their *"See Spot Parse Puff"*,
to wit, that aside from the crucial distinction
between Competence and Performance, there is the
critical third party to the dance, the one that
really calls the tune, and that is what we might
call "Reflective Knowledge" of the language, such
as would be reflected in an explicit grammar for it,
which is, after all, when the party's over, just what
the Filed Linguist seeks, and what the Field Linguist
does not yet have.  Nor do we.

Jon Awbrey
