Fred,

I think that organizing and coordinating all that material
is a mammoth undertaking, and I am happy to see somebody
trying to do something about it.

&gt;What I have is an issues-oriented collection of assertions, mini-essays,
&gt;issue statements pro-and-con, rejoinders, rejoinders-to-rejoinders, and
&gt;the like.

&gt;I've tried to strip out the repetition and only retain the meat.
&gt;For example,
&gt;I've rewritten what an author said, when he later amended his original
&gt;statement
&gt;(something backwards, misspelling, ...).

I'm concerned about what you mean "rewritten".  Correcting
obvious misspellings is OK, but anything more could be
very misleading.  I would rather see simple extracts at
the paragraph level, followed by pointers to the original
sources.

My major concern, however, is with the following choice:

&gt;It's in a Microsoft Word document and I haven't held back from using 
&gt;footnotes, pop-up comments, outline processor, and such.

Using MS Word is a disaster.  I have an old version of MS Word,
which some friends as Microsoft gave me a few years ago.  My
only use for it is to convert files to .txt form on the way
HTML.  But every two years MSFT has a deliberate policy of
making everything incompatible in order to force people to
upgrade.  My old MS Word version is now useless, and I have
to ask people to send me flat text so that I can read it.

And I'm not the only person who complains about proprietary
formats -- notice that Lee Auspitz among others has a note
in his signature file asking for nonproprietary attachments.

There is a universal standard for text files, called SGML,
of which XML and HTML are applications.  HTML and XML are
expressly designed to do exactly what you are trying to do,
and they make it very easy to include pointers to the original
sources.

&gt;I have retained attribution so that you generally know who made an
&gt;assetion
&gt;and, since some of the context is necessarily gone, I'm sure that there
&gt;would
&gt;be occasional objections as to the content.

That is exactly why you should be using HTML.  Every excerpt
you extract should have a pointer directly to the original
source.

&gt;I'm not sure how much merit this has for folks other than myself, but 
&gt;I'd be happy to share a copy with anyone who's interested.

This could have enormous value for everybody if it were in
HTML.  But MS Word is not hypertext enabled.  Even Microsoft
admits that MS Word is obsolete, and they are planning to move
to XML.  

&gt;It's about .5 megabytes and, for size reasons,
&gt;no longer contains the text of the merged ontology.

But if you used HTML, you could include a pointer to anything
you mention without a need to recopy it.

Bottom line:  I think that your idea is great.  But the choice
of MS Word makes it useless.

John Sowa
