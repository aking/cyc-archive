&gt; I am still trying to get a handle on what you are saying about what Peirce
&gt; was saying that you believe is so fundamental and compelling that we should
&gt; build our entire enterprise on concepts that you try to illustrate below.
&gt; I still have a problem with the various ways that you and the other Peirceans
&gt; talk about triadicity.  Just when I think I've got it, I see evidence that I am
&gt; incorrect in my understanding.  Apparently the language and concepts that Peirce
&gt; propounded evolved over time (76 definitions, etc.), and seems to be a subject of
&gt; controversy even among the most expert scholars.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I think, picking up on your example below.  I'm going to
&gt; abandon your table format, because I don't think I can guarantee the
&gt; prettyprint features will accommodate what I want to say.  Were I to
&gt; use your table, it would look something like this:

&gt; *********** Begin sign instance ***********
&gt; 
&gt; Sign:  "rose"
&gt; 
&gt; Referent:
&gt; Imaginary color (expressed in the French language)
&gt; of an imaginary (plastic?) disc, imagined to be used
&gt; as one of number of game pieces in an imaginary game
&gt; of Tower of Hanoi.

When you say "imaginary color", which aspect of that
is the most important to you, the color or the image?

If you want to talk about the property of a thing that we call its color,
then I would call this property an "object", merely because it is an object
of discussion and thought, and thus an object of the signs that go into this
process of talking and thinking.

If you want to talk about the impression of a color that we have in our minds,
then I would call this mental impression an "image", and I would tend to treat it,
in the first instance, as a type of "sign", one that resides or flits through the
minds of creatures like us -- though, of course, anything at all, even this image,
becomes an object of discussion and thought as soon as anybody talks or thinks
about it, like we are now.

Now, I use the word "referent" in conformity with a whole user community --
and this is an army somewhat larger than the paltry platoon of Peirceans --
so take your pick, and pay the consequences of doing so.
(Do as we say -- and nobody will get hurt?)

&gt; Sign emitter:  Josiane Caron-Pargue

It is a popular option to parameterize signs by the various sorts of agents
that bear them in various sorts of ways, where "agent" can mean a community,
a person, an animal, a machine, a divinity, and so on.  I have just sought
to transmit to you what I consider to be the benefit of my experience, and
the benefit of what my experience has taught me is a quantum of good advice
from Peirce, that this particular way of doing things will ultimately lead to
despair, but then, I did not take Peirce's advice either until after I had gone
out and personally experienced some of this despair.  So it goes.  At any rate,
you may consider the fact that the particular role of transmitter or receiver
is of secondary importance here, since people are always talking to themselves
as they to talk to others, if you catch my drift.

&gt; Purpose:  Illustration of a technique for analyzing certain kinds of discourse
&gt;
&gt; (??)

Purpose is good.  But consider this, for a pragmatic thinker "purpose" is
a synonym for "object", that is, "objective" (aim, business, concern, end,
goal, intention, interest, 'pragma').  All of which raises an interesting
question:  What is the relationship of this "big object", that is to say,
the "big idea", the overall objective that an agent is directed toward,
to the "bit object", in the present case, the property that is being
talked or thought about at the moment in question?

In this connection, one of the reasons why 3-adic relations are so important
is that they are what it takes for you to focus on a "little object" without
losing track of the "big object" of which it forms a part, in other words,
to put your effort into getting from A to B without forgetting that you
were doing this order to get from A to Z.

&gt; Occasion of emission:
&gt; E-mail message on a discussion list of a working group
&gt; of an international standards body, distributed to the
&gt; list on 18 May, 2001.

You may, of course, add as many additional parameters as you wish.
But are they necessary to the programme, or merely excess baggage?
That is, what is the appropriate level of abstraction for what we
are trying to get at here?

&gt; Medium:
&gt; E-mail, including multiple servers, software protocols, screen display, etc.

Ditto.

&gt; Understanding:
&gt; The symbol "rose" standing metonymously
&gt; for a pink imaginary disc in an imaginary game.

Now I used to think I knew what "metonymy" meant.
Toward what purpose do you purpose the word here?
According to the correspondence between my sight
and my understanding this very word "rose" marks
a hue that by any other name would blush as pink.

&gt; Intended recipient(s) of sign:
&gt; Participants in the e-mail list of a working group of an international standards body.

Does this affect the meaning of the French word "rose"?

&gt; *********** End sign instance ***********
&gt; 
&gt; Notice that this example is created from the point of view of the sign emitter,
&gt; rather than the sign recipient.  I am just now realizing that this may be a major
&gt; disconnect between what you are trying to do and what I hope to accomplish through
&gt; participation in SUO.  Your work seems to be centered on inquiry, where my concern
&gt; is communication.

If you never reach a point in the process of communication
where disagreement, misunderstanding, or uncertainty arises,
or even has the future prospect of arising, then the topic
of inquiry will not have any relevance to you.  Otherwise,
you will find yourself soon engaged in a problematic that
has a remarkable formal similarity to that covered under
the heading of "inquiry", whatever name you call it by.

&gt; For the kind of issues I am trying to address e.g. commercial transactions
&gt; among humans, using computer and telecommunications networks) I think that
&gt; it is much more possible to address the problem from the point of view of
&gt; what's going on with emitters than recipients of signs.  We're much more
&gt; likely to be able to identify them, and to actually inquire into what is
&gt; going on in their minds with respect to purposes and understandings.

I am tempted not to answer at this point.
That would teach you not to consider the
recipient.  Instead I will emit this bit
of a reply to remind you how dialectical
are these entangled aspects of dialogues.

&gt; However, here's a mirror image of the same sign,
&gt; from the point of view of one recipient:
&gt; 
&gt; *********** Begin recipient viewpoint ***********
&gt; 
&gt; Sign:  "rose"
&gt; 
&gt; Referent, or object referred to:  Unknown (at the time).
&gt; 
&gt; Sign recipient:  Doug McDavid
&gt; 
&gt; Purpose:
&gt; Monitoring all communication on a discussion list of a working group
&gt; of an international standards body for general interest and possible
&gt; future useful applicability.
&gt; 
&gt; Occasion of receipt:
&gt; Scanning e-mail messages on a discussion list of a working group
&gt; of an international standards body, on or about 18 May, 2001.
&gt; 
&gt; Medium:  E-mail
&gt; 
&gt; Understanding:
&gt; Nothing in particular. (When this thread started,
&gt; I had no idea what it was about).
&gt; 
&gt; Sign emitter:  Josiane Caron-Pargue
&gt; 
&gt; *********** End recipient viewpoint ***********
&gt; 
&gt; Some observations about this example:
&gt; 
&gt; *  In a very real sense every sign is irreducible with respect to these
&gt;    eight aspects (sign, referent, emitter, recipient, occasion, medium,
&gt;    purpose understanding).

Proof?

&gt; *  Some of the aspects may be unknown at various points in time,
&gt;    or unknowable external to an individual sign emitter or recipient.
&gt; 
&gt; *  The medium tends to be common between emitter and recipient (sound waves,
&gt;    magazine page, billboard, etc., with more variation possible in the instance
&gt;    of computer networks).
&gt; 
&gt; *  There is complexity within each of these aspects, but most especially
&gt;    with respect to purposes and understandings.
&gt; 
&gt; *  Correspondence among understandings has a lot to do with
&gt;    correspondence (or symmetry) among purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; *  The general purpose for efforts like SUO, in my opinion, has to do specifically
&gt;    with helping to line up understandings between emitters and recipients.  It is
&gt;    because of the ambiguity of signs based on implicit and mismatched understandings
&gt;    that we want to devise schemes for making dimensions of understanding explicit,
&gt;    so that signs will be interpreted identically (or at least similarly) by multiple
&gt;    recipients, and in correspondence with the purpose of the emitter.
&gt;
&gt; For instance, the Tower of Hanoi is not really a discussion of the spectral analysis
&gt; of color, but rather imaginary discs that are distinguished by color, such that the
&gt; dimensions of understanding will not line up properly without placing them in the
&gt; ontology of imagined molecular objects, rather than the ontology of color terms.

I think that you may have forgotten about the "Dialogue In Nature" (DIN),
that we have so much less ability to shout down and to gain control over.
