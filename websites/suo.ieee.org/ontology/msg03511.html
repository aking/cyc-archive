Note 82

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Warning!  In the passage ahead, I'm attempting
to merge the technical and the terminological
conventions of several different communities
of interpretation.  The result still seems
to me a little bit like the traffic melee
that might be conveyed by the movie title:
&quot;Our American Cousin on Piccadilly Circus&quot;.
With a li'l bit o' luck we'll sort it out.

1.3.10.9  The Cactus Language:  Syntax (cont.)

The &quot;painted cactus language&quot; with paints in the
set !P! = {p_j : j in J} is the formal language
!L! = !C!(!P!) c !A!* = (!M! |_| !P!)* that is
defined as follows:

PC 1.  The blank symbol m_1 is a sentence.

PC 2.  The paint p_j is a sentence, for each j in J.

PC 3.  Conc^0 and Surc^0 are sentences.

PC 4.  For each positive integer k,

       if    z_1, ..., z_k are sentences,

       then  Conc^k_j  z_j is a sentence,

       and   Surc^k_j  z_j is a sentence.

As usual, saying that z is a sentence is just a conventional way of
stating that the string z belongs to the relevant formal language !L!.
An individual sentence of !C!(!P!), for any palette !P!, is referred to
as a &quot;painted and rooted cactus expression&quot; (PARCE) on the palette !P!,
or a &quot;cactus expression&quot;, for short.  Anticipating the forms that the
parse graphs of these PARCE's will take, to be described in the next
Subsection, the language !L! = !C!(!P!) is also described as the
set PARCE(!P!) of PARCE's on the palette !P!, more generically,
as the PARCE's that constitute the language PARCE.

A &quot;bare&quot; PARCE, a bit loosely referred to as a &quot;bare cactus expression&quot;,
is a PARCE on the empty palette !P! = {}.  A bare PARCE is a sentence
in the &quot;bare cactus language&quot;, !C!^0 = !C!({}) = PARCE^0 = PARCE({}).
This set of strings, regarded as a formal language in its own right,
is a sublanguage of every cactus language !C!(!P!).  A bare cactus
expression is commonly encountered in practice when one has occasion
to start with an arbitrary PARCE and then finds a reason to delete or
to erase all of its paints.

Only one thing remains to cast this description of the cactus language
into a form that is commonly found acceptable.  As presently formulated,
the principle PC 4 appears to be attempting to define an infinite number
of new concepts all in a single step, at least, it appears to invoke the
indefinitely long sequences of operators, Conc^k and Surc^k, for all k &gt; 0.
As a general rule, one prefers to have an effectively finite description of
conceptual objects, and this means restricting the description to a finite
number of schematic principles, each of which involves a finite number of
schematic effects, that is, a finite number of schemata that explicitly
relate conditions to results.

A start in this direction, taking steps toward an effective description
of the cactus language, a finitary conception of its membership conditions,
and a bounded characterization of a typical sentence in the language, can be
made by recasting the present description of these expressions into the pattern
of what is called, more or less roughly, a &quot;formal grammar&quot;.

A notation in the pattern !S! :&gt; !T!,
variously read in a manifold of ways:

|   !S! covers !T!
|
|   !S! governs !T!
|
|   !S! rules !T!
|
|   !S! subsumes !T!
|
|   !S! types over !T!

is introduced for polymorphic employment in the following roles:

1.  To signify that an individually named or quoted string !T!
    is typed as a sentence !S! of the language of interest !L!.

2.  To express the fact or to make the assertion that each member
    of a specified set of strings !T! c !A!* also belongs to the
    syntactic category !S!, the one that qualifies a string as
    being a sentence in the relevant language !L!.

3.  To specify the intension or to signify the intention that every string
    that fits the conditions of the abstract type !T! must also fall under
    the grammatical heading of a sentence, as indicated by a typing of !S!,
    all within the target language !L!.

In these types of situation the letter &quot;!S!&quot;, that signifies the type of
a sentence in the language of interest, is called the &quot;initial symbol&quot; or
the &quot;sentence symbol&quot; of a prospective grammar for the language, while any
number of letters like &quot;!T!&quot;, signifying other types of strings that are
necessary to a reasonable account or a rational reconstruction of these
sentences, are collectively referred to as being &quot;intermediate symbols&quot;.
Combining these two sets results in the set of &quot;non-terminal symbols&quot;.
Completing the package, the alphabet !A! of the language is also known
as the set of &quot;terminal symbols&quot;.  In this discussion, I will employ the
convention that $Q$ is the set of intermediate symbols, but I will often
use &quot;q&quot; as a typical variable that ranges over all of the non-terminal
symbols, q in {&quot;!S!&quot;} |_| $Q$.  Finally, it is useful to refer to all
of the symbols in {&quot;!S!&quot;} |_| $Q$ |_| !A! as the &quot;augmented alphabet&quot;
of a prospective grammar for the language, and so to dub the strings
in ({&quot;!S!&quot;} |_| $Q$ |_| !A!)* as the &quot;augmented strings&quot;, in effect,
expressing the forms that are superimposed on a language by one of
its conceivable grammars.  In certain settings, it is important to
separate the augmented strings that contain the symbol &quot;!S!&quot; from
all other sorts of augmented strings.  In these situations, the
strings in the disjoint union {&quot;!S!&quot;} |_| ($Q$ |_| !A!)* are
known as the &quot;sentential forms&quot; of the associated grammar.
