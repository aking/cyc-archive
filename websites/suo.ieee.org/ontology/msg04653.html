&gt; 1.5.  Inquiry Driven Systems (concl.)
&gt; 
&gt; An inquiry driven system, in the simplest cases worth talking about,
&gt; requires at least three different modalities of knowledge component,
&gt; referred to as &quot;expectations&quot;, &quot;intentions&quot;, and &quot;observations&quot; of
&gt; the system.  Each of these components has the status of a theory,
&gt; that is, a propositional code that the agent of the system carries
&gt; along and maintains with itself through all of its changes of state,
&gt; possibly updating it as the need arises in experience.  However, all
&gt; of these theories have reference to a common world, and they indicate
&gt; under their varying lights more or less overlapping regions in the
&gt; state space of the system, or in some derivative or extension of
&gt; the basic state space.

MW: &quot;reference to a common world&quot; is the question. We would probably
all agree that there is one &quot;common world&quot; that we all experience, but
there is good evidence that we don't all experience it the same way,
e.g. 3D 4D that even discriminate different objects.

Now in a system, you only have a reference to the real world, so my
point of clarification is when you say &quot;common world&quot; do you mean
&quot;common reference&quot;? Either way it would be useful to say something
about the link between perception and reality here.

&gt; 
&gt; The inquiry process is driven by the nature, the degree, and 
&gt; the extent
&gt; of the differences that exist at any time among its operative 
&gt; theories,
&gt; for example, the differences among the expectations, the 
&gt; intentions, and
&gt; the observations of the inquiry agent or the relevant 
&gt; community of inquiry.
&gt; These discrepancies are evidenced by differences in the 
&gt; assemblies of models,
&gt; empirical or theoretical, that are held to satisfy the 
&gt; respective theories.
&gt; Normally, human beings experience a high level of disparity 
&gt; among these
&gt; theories as a dissatisfying situation, a condition of 
&gt; cognitive discord.
&gt; For people, the incongruity of cognitive elements is accompanied by an
&gt; unsettled affective state, in Peirce's phrase, the 
&gt; &quot;irritation of doubt&quot;.
&gt; A person in this situation is usually motivated to reduce the annoying
&gt; disturbance by some action, all of which activities we may classify
&gt; under the heading of inquiry processes.
&gt; 
&gt; Without insisting on strict determinism, we may say that the 
&gt; inquiry process is
&gt; lawful if there is any kind of informative relationship 
&gt; connecting the state of
&gt; cognitive discord at each time with the ensuing state 
&gt; transitions of the system.
&gt; Expressed in human terms, a difference between expectations 
&gt; and observations is
&gt; experienced as a surprise to be explained, a difference 
&gt; between intentions and
&gt; observations is experienced as a problem to be solved.  We 
&gt; begin to understand
&gt; a particular example of inquiry when we can describe the 
&gt; relation between the
&gt; momentary intellectual state of its agent and the subsequent 
&gt; action that the
&gt; agent undertakes.
&gt; 
&gt; These simple facts, the features of inquiry outlined above, 
&gt; already raise
&gt; a number of issues, some of which are open problems that my 
&gt; research will
&gt; have to address.  Given the goal of constructing supports for 
&gt; inquiry on
&gt; the grounds of systems theory, each of these difficulties is 
&gt; an obstacle
&gt; to progress in the chosen direction, to understanding the capacity for
&gt; inquiry as a systems property.
