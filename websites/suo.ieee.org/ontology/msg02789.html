Matt,

	I think we need to distinguish two different senses of
"organization".  In one sense, an "organization" is an institutionalized
group of people that exhibits intentionality.  In the SUMO, this sense of
"organization" is referred to by the concept 'Organization' (this class is a
subclass of 'GroupOfPeople' which, in turn, is a subclass of 'Group').  In
another sense, an "organization" is a structure (with a certain degree of
complexity and regularity).  This sort of "organization" can, to my mind, be
either intentional or naturally occurring.  This second sense does not, from
a quick search and from what I can recall, have a representation in the
SUMO.  It's an important notion, but so far it isn't covered.  If you would
be willing to define a concept and locate it in the SUMO, that would be very
worthwhile.  

	Now, to analyse the examples you give, I would say that a swarm of
bees, a culture of slime mold cells, the gameboard, and the particles are
"organizations" in the second sense, but not in the first sense.  However, a
swarm of bees would be a 'Group', to use the SUMO term, because it is a
group of Animals that exhibit agency. The culture of slime mold cells, the
gameboard, and the particles do not exhibit agency, so they are not examples
of 'Groups'.  A crowd of people in panic would be a 'GroupOfPeople', again
to use the SUMO term, but it would not be an 'Organization', because their
grouping is not institutionalized.  I hope this clarifies things.

-Ian

&gt; 
&gt; I'm just curious about something.  If a flock of geese (in formation)
&gt; exhibits agency, what about:
&gt; 
&gt; * a swarm of bees?
&gt; * a culture of slime mold cells (collecting to form a stalk)?
&gt; * a crowd in a panic?
&gt; * a gameboard of Conway's 'Life'?
&gt; * particles in a multi-body physics problem?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering about collective behavior or structure that looks
&gt; "organized" but that might have "intentionality" ranging from high to
&gt; none.  To me, "Organization" as a label implies intentionally-created
&gt; structure, rather than naturally-emergent structure.  
&gt; 
&gt; That is, if you would call a flock of geese an Organization, but you
&gt; wouldn't call a willow tree an Organization (even though we 
&gt; can observe
&gt; very rich and useful structure in it), it seems the difference is our
&gt; assumption that the geese are actively choosing to be in 
&gt; formation.  If
&gt; so, where is the cutoff between awareness, instinct, reflex, 
&gt; and low-level
&gt; chemical/physical processes that tell us when we're looking 
&gt; at agents or
&gt; organizations?  Somewhat off-topic, I know; I just found it a curious
&gt; problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some examples of this sort of set are football teams and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flocks of geese.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; [Matthew]
&gt; &gt; &gt; I would consider these to be organisations (in some
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; No, I actually prefer geese to football too...  
&gt; Furthermore, I agree that
&gt; &gt; flocks of geese can exhibit agency.  This is actually why I 
&gt; put them under
&gt; &gt; 'Group' in the SUMO.  The class 'Group' inherits from both 
&gt; 'Collection' and
&gt; &gt; 'Agent'.  I think we agree about everything here.  It's 
&gt; just that the SUMO,
&gt; &gt; in its current incarnation at least, has a terminology that 
&gt; is somewhat
&gt; &gt; different from one you might have chosen.
