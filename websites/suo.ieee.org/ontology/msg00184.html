Graham --

This is a helpful elaboration.  Let me just repeat the heart of my question
earlier:

Given that ontologies, and specifically the SUO, have at least one
agreed-upon role, which is to aid in the interoperability of software
applications,
and, given that you have expressed a role for a structured language as a
communication device among human beings, can you provide a list of the
kinds of circumstances where you think formal ontologies and structured
language should be used in human-to-human communication, in addition to
software application-to-software application interoperability?

Thanks,


Doug

Dear Douglas,
     .    I'm afraid, your speculation on "what I think may be your
main thesis" is way off track. But, while you're there, I will elaborate a
bit, in the vague hope it may elaborate my perspective.

     .    There are several sources for ambiguity in communication.
1.   multiple meanings for individual words (which think of roughly as
lexical ambiguity, and is often because we can encompass more meanings by
use of metaphors), and I can think of two basic types:
a.   specific different meanings, eg "hock", and
b.   meanings that are not precise, as exemplified by the haziness
regarding the overlapping dictionary meanings of "administration",
"management" and  "control", which could be assisted by amending their
defined meanings to provide clearly distinctive aspects differentiating
them,
2.   multiple meanings for particular text structures (which I think of
roughly as semantic ambiguity);
3.   deliberate use of expressions by the author to simultaneously infer,
or allow, more than one meaning from a piece of text, eg.
a.   a double entendre, often used for artistic purposes, or
b.   use of a hazy description to precisely reflect a hazy comprehension
of what one is trying to communicate;
4.   lack of education of the author and or the recipient, which can be
broken down into:
a.   lack of linguistic education (what particular words mean, and/or
when to use them), and
b.   lack of general education, so that the implications of different
concepts are incompletely and/or erroneously understood,
5.   laziness on the part of the author in terms of not using the correct
terminology to indicate their meaning, sometimes causing considerable
trouble, and
6.   expediency on the part of the author in terms of not using the
correct terminology to indicate their meaning, due to lapses of memory, or
time or other pressures.

     .    Regarding point 4, when, some while ago, I described a
reduction in the level of teaching of formal grammar, my comments were
derided by some SUO participants - the words "utterly bizarre" were used.
*    It so happens that a work colleague adjacent me had no formal
grammar training at school, having attended during the period when teaching
of grammar was banned in at least one Australian state. He assures me he
has
no idea of how to parse an English sentence. Not surprisingly, his
inclination is that English is an Amorphous collection of words of almost
infinite applicability. Essentially, he uses words "because they sound
right
under the circumstances". I might add, that as a software man, he is quite
capable of parsing computer code.
*    By comparison, I was taught formal grammar at school. Another
colleague here has just lent me a recent grammar text, from since it was
reintroduced into the school curriculum there. The preface talks of "both
traditional and functional grammars", but it has the basic structures I
remember being taught.
*    I put it to you that people without a knowledge of the structural
basis of formalised grammar are disadvantaged in precisely, and hence
accurately, comprehending texts. This is especially when any unusual
structure is used. I would not favour the richness of language being
"enriched" by people being educationally disadvantaged and unable to
express
what they wish to say. I would see that as a human rights issue needing
correction.

     .    Similarly, regarding point 5, when someone is lazy in
language usage, the recipient is disadvantaged in precisely, and hence
accurately, comprehending what was meant.

     .    Basically, I am opposed to points 1b, 2, 4 and 5. In my
opinion, 1a and 3 allow the richness of human communication. I also see 6
as
only a reasonable symptom of the human condition.

     .    So, I am talking about the ability to communicate precisely.
However, I am definitely not requiring that it has to be done. That is a
big
difference. I would be opposed to any hindrance to the many benefits to
society afforded by deliberate ambiguity.

     .    I hope you can see the basis of my approach, and that it
does not involve the issues that you rightly oppose.
