Pat,

I am returning to your last reply again,
to see if I can get any further with it.

Pat Hayes wrote:

&gt; You say you are interested in integrating
&gt; functional and declarative aspects of languages,
&gt; which is also a central interest of mine.  Even here,
&gt; KIF is worthy of a little careful study (although this goes
&gt; way beyond what is needed for the SUO enterprise, I believe).

I am planning to discuss this in more detail on the history channel,
but I have yet to see what I am looking for in this regard with any
of the more standard ways of laying out FOL, or any offspring of it --
though I do have this dim memory that I once thought ML and Miranda
might provide a promising base of operations on which to build what
I want here, I never got down to looking any further into it -- but
what 'this' is is the agility and the flexibility of interpretation
that permits one to maintain a "functional interpretation" (FI) for
all logical expressions.  In short, any logical expression e has an
interpretation as a name of a function, almost as if e = "f", where
f : X -&gt; B, for a suitable domain X and for B = {0, 1}, as is usual.
Here, I say "almost as if" because the range of interpretations for
an expression e is actually somewhat broader than a relation to any
proper name like "f" would be able to encompass.

I have pretty successfuly worked all of this stuff out in conceptual terms,
at the very least, at the sub-foundational level of propositional calculus,
and I have already programmed an implementation of a propositional utility
that respects and supports these reqs and specs for a FI of PC expressions.

In this conception the relationship between the evaluative function
and the assertive declaration is simply that between a function and
its so-called "fibers" (also called "antecedent sets", "pre-images",
or "level sets").  Thus, the "models" or satisfying interpretations
of the expression e = "f" are those elements of the relevant domain
belonging to the "fiber of truth" under f, namely, (f^(-1))(1) in X.

Okay, that made me really tired, so I had better
go have some breakfast, and maybe take a vitamin.

Until Later,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; For example, KIF 3.0 has a basic semantic flaw which makes
&gt; it not strictly first-order;  it assumes that sequences are
&gt; finite, a constraint which is not first-order expressible.
&gt; But notice that this assumption *is* expressible in the usual
&gt; fixed-point semantics for recursive programming languages, and
&gt; would indeed validate the many 'recursive' definitions in the
&gt; KIF 3.0 manual.  So it seems to me that KIF might indeed be
&gt; a very good tree to try climbing in order to get at this
&gt; particular kind of research fruit.
&gt;
&gt; Can one give it a semantics which somehow combines what one
&gt; wants of the assertional expressive power of a quantified logic
&gt; with some the recursive power of a functional programming language?
&gt; How?  I honestly do not know,  but I think it would be well worth
&gt; careful study.  Suppose one could:  what then would happen to the
&gt; self-description abilities of KIF, in the light of this new semantics?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Why would I want to be a part of building a language that
&gt; &gt; I myself would not use, could not use for any significant
&gt; &gt; purpose under the sun?   Why would I want to sell to others,
&gt; &gt; to impose on others, a language that they will have so much
&gt; &gt; trouble, with mechanized help or otherwise, using to think?
&gt;
&gt; Can you tell us HOW this language is hampering our thinking, in your view?
&gt; Or what sort of language might be less hampering?  I might be a lost cause,
&gt; of course, having been thinking in, and about, FOL most of my adult life.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I never know where any language might be capable of going over time,
&gt; &gt; and so the only features that I see worth criticizing in FOL or KIF
&gt; &gt; are the features that would keep them cast in stone, fixed in place,
&gt; &gt; or rooted to the spots that they currently inhabit.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, its true that the *language* doesnt have any intrinsic machinery
&gt; for changing itself (although it is possible, in principle, to express
&gt; in KIF's metatheory axioms which, when added to a knowledge base, will
&gt; extend the set of forms recognisable by the parser.   But I would have
&gt; to agree with anyone who would say this wasnt a very practical device.)
&gt; But the *ontology* expressed in the language is capable of being extended
&gt; and modified, and this is I think where the SUO effort should be focussed.
&gt; The particular language used in not in itself of deep importance, provided
&gt; that it has a certain basic expressive power:  one can write translators 
&gt; between various ontology languages.
&gt;
