Dear Jon,

&gt; 1.  In my opinion, the question should be the pertinence, the 
&gt;     quality, and the rationality
&gt;     of my contributions.  

MW: I agree.

&gt;     I welcome any concrete advice, 
&gt;     criticisms, and objections that
&gt;     you or anyone might have about these aspects of my 
&gt;     efforts here.  

MW: This is asking for it, and I will make some suggestions below.
But at least I speak as one who believes you have a contribution
to make.

&gt;     I have acted on
&gt;     such advice over the past year.  I have changed the style 
&gt;     of my discussion, to
&gt;     the best of my present abilities, to accommodate the 
&gt;     purposes and even the
&gt;     reading tastes of the Working Group.

MW: I agree you have made changes (improvements) to the style
of your contributions. I have noticed in particular that your 
contributions are much less eliptical. I am gateful, it has meant
I have been able to follow a greater percentage of what you have
to say. For the record I probably manage to read half of what you
write, and get the gist of two thirds of that.

MW: OK. Well here comes the tough bit. How do I think you could
improve the effectiveness of your contribution? Note this is a
personal view. It is what I would like to see.

MW: The real problem is not what you are trying to say, but the
way you are saying it. You are using what I would describe as
an academic approach rather than a business approach. An academic
approach builds up the foundations on which an argument is built
before setting out the key conclusions of an argument. A business
approach presents the conclusions, and promises the foundations
in an appendix that is yet to be written, and will not be unless
the conclusions are challenged.

MW: The consequence of the approach you take is that the volume
of your contributions is significant, with it taking a long time 
to reach the point you are trying to make, by which time most
people have lost interest. Indeed I suspect many feel there
probably isn't any conclusion at all.

MW: If you started with some bold assertions/conclusions about
what we needed to do to achieve something useful (1 page max)
then you might expect to be challenged, but that would give you
the opportunity to elaborate on the issues someone else raised.

MW: One story burned in my memory from long ago is the one about
the manager who asked his subordinate to produce a 1 page summary
of some burning issue. The subordinate worked all night to distill
his 10 page thesis down to 1 page, but he could only get it down to
one and a half pages. He took it to his boss and apologised, but
said he really couldn't get it down to just a page. His boss took
the 2 pages from him and told him not to worry, because he knew just
how to do that, as he threw the second page in the waste bin.

MW: The point is, that if your customer will only read one page, it
doesn't matter how much more you write.

MW: OK, that is one suggestion, start by bringing the conclusions to
the list, not the working. On the other hand I would appreciate the
working of some of your threads as PDF documents as backup to the
conclusions. PDF would have the advantage of solving the presentation
issues you have too, since you would not be limited to ASCII, and I 
would then have a coherent record I could refer to more easily.

MW: I know you think no one will read something in a PDF document,
but I got some responses to my recent contribution on modularisation
that I did in this way, and if you have presented your conclusions in
a tempting way, then I think you would get more interest in what you
have to say.

MW: Well enough I guess, except perhaps to offer a little time to work
with you off list on some trials at my proposed approach should you
choose to accept the challenge.

&gt; Subject: SUO: Re: Trying to work with Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; JA = Jon Awbrey
&gt; JS = Jim Schoening
&gt; 
&gt; JS: As Jon Awbrey has taken this matter public, I should 
&gt; probably say something.
&gt; 
&gt; I have never desired for this standards business to be 
&gt; anything but public.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: I have tried for over a year to ask Jon to limit the 
&gt; quantity of his postings
&gt;     and to focus on the work of this group, but he refuses to 
&gt; cooperate.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  In my opinion, the question should be the pertinence, the 
&gt; quality, and the rationality
&gt;     of my contributions.  I welcome any concrete advice, 
&gt; criticisms, and objections that
&gt;     you or anyone might have about these aspects of my 
&gt; efforts here.  I have acted on
&gt;     such advice over the past year.  I have changed the style 
&gt; of my discussion, to
&gt;     the best of my present abilities, to accommodate the 
&gt; purposes and even the
&gt;     reading tastes of the Working Group.  Like the Texas 
&gt; accent of my youth,
&gt;     regressions will sometimes occur when I am highly 
&gt; agitated, and there
&gt;     is much that agitates me in this forum, but I believe 
&gt; that I am doing
&gt;     much better of late.  If the pertinence, the quality, and the
&gt;     rationality of my postings is satisfactory, then the question
&gt;     of their quantity has a different sense than what you suggest --
&gt;     converting it to one in which all reasonable people would say:
&gt;     &quot;The more the better&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I have reasons to think that my contributions amount to a 
&gt; positive thrust
&gt;     toward discharging the espoused aims and charges of the 
&gt; SUO Working Group.
&gt;     I have expressed those reasons in public forum where 
&gt; anyone may criticize
&gt;     them, by presenting reasoned evidence of their own, until 
&gt; some form of
&gt;     resolution occurs.  That is the way that I have always 
&gt; been told that
&gt;     it should be done.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  I am prepared to argue that my present lines of contribution have
&gt;     more pertinence to the Scope &amp; Purpose of the SUO Working Group,
&gt;     a higher quality overall, and a better rationale on many points
&gt;     than various parallels in the current Starter Documents.
&gt;     At any rate, I am taking the trouble to exposit what
&gt;     I deposit, which these other champions are sadly
&gt;     failing to do, much to the detriment of the
&gt;     Working Group's ability to evaluate them.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  You do not seem to get the fact that I am doing my level best
&gt;     to accord you the professional service of telling you exactly
&gt;     how these prospective standards will be judged by the academic,
&gt;     professional, and user communities with which I am very familiar.
&gt;     I simply think that it is better that the Group should hear about
&gt;     it now, while there is still time to fix it, rather than waiting
&gt;     to roundly ridiculed by the first elect body of external experts
&gt;     to which these inept pretensions of expertise present themselves.
&gt;     Hear me now, and believe me later, as I think the line goes.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: He won't even try to work with me to resolve these issues.
&gt; 
&gt; I offered to discuss these issues on the Ontology List.  You declined.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: Jon claims this is a completely open forum, which gives him the
&gt;     right to post anything he chooses.  Let me be clear, this is not
&gt;     a completely open list.  It could function as one, as 
&gt; virtually all
&gt;     standards lists do, but only if all subscribers follow 
&gt; common sense
&gt;     rules of posting.  I, and many I hear from (publicly and 
&gt; privately),
&gt;     feel Jon has crossed far over this line.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not believe that I have said anything like this.
&gt; Backgound:  Here in Michigan, and in most other States
&gt; where I have lived and worked, we have what is called
&gt; an &quot;Open Meetings Act&quot;.  It means, for example, that
&gt; governing bodies of every sort, regulatory agencies,
&gt; Boards of Governors, Regents, Trustees, and so on,
&gt; of publicly funded institutions and universities,
&gt; ad infinitum, must have all their decision-making
&gt; meetings be &quot;Open&quot; to the public.  They are not,
&gt; not legally, permitted to get togther in small
&gt; groups in bars and restaurants or phone caucus
&gt; to &quot;pre-decide&quot; the actions that they will take
&gt; on their agendas.  That is how I understand the
&gt; word &quot;Open&quot; in this context and in this case.
&gt; I am not a lawyer, and do not play one on the
&gt; internet, but I have always intuitively assumed
&gt; that a public, professional standards body must
&gt; necessarily be operating under a similar such
&gt; ethical principle, of not carrying on public,
&gt; professional business by undocumented means.
&gt; At any rate, this is my personal ethic, and
&gt; I will do the best I can not to violate it.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: Jon recently informed me he would no longer communicate 
&gt; with me on this issue
&gt;     and intended to post whatever he desired.  I informed him 
&gt; he needed to either
&gt;     work with me to resolve these issues or face having his 
&gt; email moderated (i.e.
&gt;     blocked and forwarded to me for forwarding to the SUO 
&gt; list).  I had never
&gt;     wanted to issue this warning and I hope I don't have to 
&gt; follow it through,
&gt;     but I will have no choice if he doesn't start cooperating.
&gt; 
&gt; That is not what I said.  I said that I would not
&gt; discuss it by phone or by private email messages,
&gt; and offered to take it to the Ontology List,
&gt; where substantive resolutions that developed
&gt; could be &quot;reported back to the floor&quot; by
&gt; simple link passing.  You declined.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: Is there anyone who knows Jon well enough to get involved and
&gt;     try to resolve this?  Does anyone see any other options?  If not,
&gt;     I will try one more time to work with Jon, but then will proceed
&gt;     with moderating his postings.
&gt; 
&gt; I will strenuously object to this.  I request that you present
&gt; reasoned arguments for your so far completely bald objections
&gt; to the pertinence, the quality, and the rationality of my
&gt; current contributions, or else cease to assert them.
&gt; 
&gt; With respect to procedural issues, the role of research, a 
&gt; reasonable timeline
&gt; for the project, and many other issues of that nature, my 
&gt; positions are quite
&gt; the same as more seasoned members of this group.  In these 
&gt; regards, I request
&gt; that you quit picking on me -- just because you can -- and 
&gt; start picking on
&gt; somebody your own size.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Previous Communication:
&gt; 
&gt; JS: I am disturbed by your plans to cease our discussions.
&gt;     We have a problem we need to work out.  I've given
&gt;     this some thought and here's what I'd like to do.
&gt;     I'd like to privately work through some of the
&gt;     issues we have, and offer you some advice on
&gt;     how to become a more productive contributor
&gt;     to the SUO WG, which I believe you can be.
&gt;     But if you are unwilling to work with me,
&gt;     I have determined, after much thought,
&gt;     that it will be my responsibility as
&gt;     Chair to start moderating your postings
&gt;     (Blocking your address and requiring you
&gt;     to send messages to me, which I will post
&gt;     if I deem relevant.)  I had hoped to never
&gt;     have to warn you of this option, and I hope
&gt;     to never have to excercise it.  I suggest you
&gt;     swallow your pride and work with me.  Fair enough?
&gt;     Please let me know your intentions.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I cannot work under this type of censorship.
&gt;     I have repeatedly explained the relevance
&gt;     of my contributions to the espoused aims
&gt;     of the SUO Group, as recorded in the S&amp;P,
&gt;     and I'm willing to do what it takes to
&gt;     make the direct bearing of this work
&gt;     clear to you and everybody, but I
&gt;     cannot spend more time talking to
&gt;     people who are not really taking
&gt;     the time to read or think about
&gt;     what they criticize.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I resent the sort of off-list arm-twisting
&gt;     and lobbying that you have been subjecting
&gt;     me to the last couple of days, and I regard
&gt;     it as inapproriate conduct for the Chair not
&gt;     to be airing these matters in public forum.
&gt;     I offered to discuss it on the Ontology List --
&gt;     you demurred -- I continue to regard this as
&gt;     an open, public, professional forum, and neither
&gt;     democracy nor science can duke it out in the lobby.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I have expressed to you my belief that undocumented discussions
&gt;     of SUO business are wrong, and I will no longer engage in them.
&gt;     When the OSEC (Ontological Securities &amp; Exchange Commission)
&gt;     gets around to investigating the Big Ontology Crash of 2020,
&gt;     my conscience will be clear.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I have started my views on the two present starter documents.
&gt;     Strange as it may seem to you, I have tried to remain polite
&gt;     in on-list discsussions of these efforts, and when I cannot
&gt;     be both polite and honest then I usually just bite my tongue
&gt;     and keep it to myself.  If you force me to choose, I will
&gt;     have to go with honest.  I am hardly the only person who
&gt;     is ignoring these documents -- and that includes their
&gt;     so-called &quot;champions&quot;, who you would think had an
&gt;     interest in expositing their positions on-list --
&gt;     I myself learned a long time ago that nobody
&gt;     in this world meets you a tithe of the way
&gt;     in this regard.  In the meantime, I might
&gt;     as well be doing something useful toward
&gt;     the future progress of the SUO work.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: &lt;philippic deleted&gt;
