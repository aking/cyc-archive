&gt; &gt;&gt; However, I still don't understand why relations
&gt; &gt;&gt; do not also have a time dimension.
&gt;
&gt;Jon Awbrey responded:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;A k-adic (-ary, -valent) relation with a time dimension adjoined
&gt; &gt;is just a special kind of a (k+1)-adic (-ary, -valent) relation.
&gt;
&gt;Time is a very important aspect of "context", but it's only
&gt;one of many ways of classifying contexts.  Place is another
&gt;important aspect.  Combining place and time in a 4-D system
&gt;is useful, but it still doesn't capture all the possible ways
&gt;of classifying contexts.
&gt;
&gt;Other useful classifications include the people involved, the
&gt;general subject matter, the ontology used to classify the
&gt;subject, the reporter who reported the information, etc., etc.
&gt;
&gt;Example:
&gt;
&gt;The sentence "A cat is on a mat" could be represented by
&gt;the following conceptual graph (which could be translated
&gt;to KIF or any other logic-based notation):
&gt;
&gt;   [Cat]-&gt;(On)-&gt;[Mat].
&gt;
&gt;The dyadic relation (On) could be augmented with arbitrarily
&gt;many additional arguments, coordinates, attributes, or whatever
&gt;you want to call them:
&gt;
&gt;   (On)-
&gt;      -1-&gt;[Cat]
&gt;      -2-&gt;[Mat]
&gt;      -3-&gt;[Time: &lt;2001, Jan, 11, 16:12:05 UCT&gt;]
&gt;      -4-&gt;[Location: &lt;73W 53' 35", 41N 12' 27"&gt;]
&gt;      -5-&gt;[Reporter: 'John F. Sowa']
&gt;
&gt;Instead of stuffing all that information into the relation,
&gt;it is possible to wrap the original graph (or formula or
&gt;sentence or statement) in a context wrapper of type Situation
&gt;and then to add additional links to the context box:
&gt;
&gt;   [Situation: [Cat]-&gt;(On)-&gt;[Mat] ]-
&gt;      -&gt;(Ptim)-&gt;[Time: &lt;2001, Jan, 11, 16:12:05 UCT&gt;]
&gt;      -&gt;(Loc)-&gt;[Location: &lt;73W 53' 35", 41N 12' 27"&gt;]
&gt;      -&gt;(ReportedBy)-&gt;[Person: 'John F. Sowa']
&gt;
&gt;This CG could be read as the English sentence "There existed
&gt;a situation of a cat on a mat at the point in time 2001 Jan 11
&gt;16:12:05 UCT at the latitude 73W 53' 35" and longitude 41N 12' 27"
&gt;as reported by the person John F. Sowa."
&gt;
&gt;To represent this CG in KIF, one might introduce a dyadic
&gt;relation Dscr (description), whose first argument is some
&gt;entity that is described by a quoted proposition as its second
&gt;argument:
&gt;
&gt;   (exists ((?s Situation))
&gt;      (and (Dscr ?s '(exists ((?x Cat) (?y Mat)) (On ?x ?y)))
&gt;           (Ptim...  )
&gt;           (Loc...   )
&gt;           (ReportedBy... ) ))
&gt;
&gt;The dots indicate some conventions that the SUO might specify
&gt;for representing times, locations, and other information.

Fine with all this, John.  But a few questions....
1. Why not go the whole hog and have the cat, and the mat and even 
the sitting, as aspects of the situations? After all, it seems that 
the choice of these to put into a sentence representing content, as 
opposed to being kind of apppendages, is rather arbitrary: the text 
could have started :"John Sowa saw it happen one afternoon...". If 
one pursues that line, one gets to a representation very similar to 
case grammar, where there is just a central 'thing', which might be 
called variously a situation, a proposition,  an eventuality, or a 
state of affairs, or whatever, (it is whatever is basically expressed 
by a simple sentence, is the idea) and it has a largish class of 
known relations with various categories of other thing: the type (a 
sitting, in this case), an agent, a subject, a time and a place, an 
epistemic source, whatever. (Extra ones can be added later, which is 
a handly contrast to the representational technique which insists on 
putting them in as arguments to a relation.) Some of these other 
things can themselves be situations, allowing us  to talk (with some 
care) about various kinds of aspect or intentionality relationships. 
I suspect you will agree with all this, in fact.

2. On the other hand, quite what ARE these central things to which 
the other things are related? This is where I tend to get a little 
lost. I know what propositions are, more or less (I think of them as 
equivalence classes of sentences under logical equivalence, more  or 
less), and I know what times and places are, and I know what people 
are, and so on. More or less. But I really don't know what 
'situations' ARE: and without some idea about that, I don't have any 
way to evaluate anything that anyone might say about them. To follow 
the line that Nicola has always emphasised, I don't know what the 
identity conditions for situations would be.

I have met several extremal views on this, and they all make a kind 
of sense. On one view, a situation is basically a fragment of the 
world: some selected aspects of the way the world actually is. 
(Leaving aside issues about imaginary things, etc., for now.) On that 
view, for example, a fast walking and a slow travelling might well be 
the same situation, described in two different ways. This is the 
usual view among linguists, oddly enough, as far as I can determine. 
On another view, a situation is more like a piece of information 
about the world, and the 'same' physical situation might be a 
different information-situation depending on how it is described. It 
is impossible to describe the same situation in different ways: the 
differences in the descriptions are already sufficient to distinguish 
the described situations from one another. This is what Barwise 
apparently meant in 'Situation Theory', and what Hobbs means in his 
promiscuous ontology. The intuitions get even odder when one thinks 
of more complicated descriptions. If there are two cats sitting on 
the same mat, is this one or two situations? How about the same cat 
sitting on two different mats? (Why the disparity, if there is one?) 
Can situations be characterised by conditionals or disjunctions or 
negations?

Now, both of these seem to me to be reasonable answers to my basic 
question (though I prefer the first one, myself.) But Im really not 
sure what your answer is: sometimes you seem to prefer the 'physical' 
way of thinking and sometimes the 'information' way, so there seems 
to be a kind of hybrid view in there somewhere, but I can't quite 
discern what it is. (Maybe, perish the thought, I need to understand 
Peirce first...?)
