&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	Thanks for your criticisms of the merged ontology.  
&gt; Please see my
&gt; &gt;responses below.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;-Ian
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PS. I have been browsing the merged ontology and so far 
&gt; *every single
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing* I have seen in it is wrong. In particular (in no particular
&gt; &gt; &gt; order):
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. the axiom for piece-of is obviously wrong, since it 
&gt; entails that
&gt; &gt; &gt; every piece has all the properties of the whole:
&gt; &gt; &gt; (=&gt; (piece-of ?X ?Y) (forall (?Z) (=&gt; (instance-of ?Y ?Z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; (instance-of ?X ?Z))))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't see why this strikes you as obviously wrong.  I 
&gt; defined 'piece-of'
&gt; &gt;to be a specialization of 'part-of', where both of the arguments are
&gt; &gt;stuff-like entities.  You may believe that such a 
&gt; specialization is not
&gt; &gt;useful or you may be violating your own dictum that the 
&gt; meaning of a term in
&gt; &gt;a formal language is determined solely by the axioms that 
&gt; contain it.  It's
&gt; &gt;hard to see what you're up to here.
&gt; 
&gt; No, my point is that this axiom says that every property (forall 
&gt; (?Z)...) of a piece of stuff is inherited by all its pieces. That is 
&gt; obviously false. (For example, the pieces typically weigh less than 
&gt; the whole; obvious things like that.) If you mean this to apply only 
&gt; to certain 'relevant' properties, then you need to restrict that 
&gt; quantifier to include a condition like (relevant ?Z), and then give 
&gt; us some axioms for relevant.

No, actually what you say is false.  According to the merged ontology, the
second argument of 'instance-of' is required to be a class, i.e. a natural
kind, and the examples of "irrelevant" properties that you cite simply don't
and wouldn't show up as classes in the ontology.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. piece-of only applies to ContinuousObjects, which is wrong.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;See my comment above.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, but then you should document somewhere that piece-of doesnt mean 
&gt; "piece of". My automobile isn't a ContinuousObject, but it has pieces.

Really?  Nothing hinges on this, but your way of putting it sounds
infelicitous to my ear.  A pane of glass can be broken into pieces, but my
eyes would scan twice if I came across the phrase "automobile pieces" in,
e.g., newspaper text. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. OrganicSubstance is a subclass of ContinuousObject, which is
&gt; &gt; &gt; either wrong or assumes a strongly mereological view of 
&gt; objecthood.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't follow you here.  All I meant by OrganicSubstance is a
&gt; &gt;ContinuousObject which is also organic.  Of course, you had no way of
&gt; &gt;knowing this, since I neglected to include any documentation for this
&gt; &gt;concept.  Sorry about that.
&gt; 
&gt; I was reacting to the idea of putting (any kind of) Substance as a 
&gt; subclass of (any kind of) Object. The only way I can make sense of 
&gt; that is as a declaration that you are thinking of objects as 
&gt; mereological sums of substance: 'Pieces of thing-stuff' rather than 
&gt; 'thing'.  You need to get clear on what your attitude is towards the 
&gt; thing/substance distinction. (You might want to reject it, which is 
&gt; fair enough as long as you face up to the ontological consequences of 
&gt; doing that.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The explanation for continuousObject does not make sense. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; starts "A ContinuousObject is an object in which every part is
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar to every other in every relevant respect." which is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; contradiction in itself, since some parts presumably contain other
&gt; &gt; &gt; parts as parts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This would be a contradiction only if one assumed that the 
&gt; relevant respects
&gt; &gt;apply to all of the parts of the original parts, and I am 
&gt; not making this
&gt; &gt;assumption.  Generally speaking, when one distinguishes 
&gt; stuffs from objects,
&gt; &gt;one claims that the stuffs are stuff-like only at or above a 
&gt; certain level
&gt; &gt;of granularity, and, hence, parts of things at this level of 
&gt; granularity
&gt; &gt;will not be stuff-like.
&gt; 
&gt; But that is not what the text I cited says. It says "..in which EVERY 
&gt; part is similar...".  My point wasnt about the granularity issue, but 
&gt; about the fact that a part is not similar to the whole of which it is 
&gt; a part in every respect.

I just don't follow you.  The prepositional phrase "in every relevant
respect" was intended to modify "similar" in the original docu-string.  In
any case, enough said, and I'll try to write more clearly in the future. 

&gt; 
&gt; By the way, that idea of "down to a certain level of granularity" is 
&gt; a fine aspiration for an ontologist, and everyone sees that we need 
&gt; it, but nobody has actually managed to do it. I don't know of anyone 
&gt; who has axiomatized the idea satisfactorily (yet). The nearest is 
&gt; Jerry Hobbs, and he had to hack round the basic problem by assuming 
&gt; that approximation is transitive (which of course it isnt, as every 
&gt; engineer, builder and carpenter knows in detail.) Ive been trying to 
&gt; do this, on and off, for about 30 years and I havnt managed it yet, 
&gt; but I do have a very finely honed sense of how not to do it and why 
&gt; all extant ideas don't work.
&gt; 
&gt; The central problem is that the heap paradox has a very nasty 
&gt; interaction with logical inference: it violates the transitivity of 
&gt; correctness.  About every decade or so someone publishes a paper 
&gt; about granularity or approximation which fails to solve the basic 
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Can something be a selfConnectedObject and also a
&gt; &gt; &gt; ContinuousObject? If so, what is a superficial-part-of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; ContinuousObject, and if a superficial-part-of is also a 
&gt; part, is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar in every relevant respect to a non-superficial 
&gt; part? If not,
&gt; &gt; &gt; why is the object Continuous; if so, what makes the part 
&gt; superificial?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yes, the merged ontology allows that a ContinuousObject can also be a
&gt; &gt;SelfConnectedObject.  A superficial part of a 
&gt; ContinuousObject would be a
&gt; &gt;part of the ContinuousObject at the surface which has the precise
&gt; &gt;granularity for the stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; You are relying on this notion of granularity to do a lot of your 
&gt; work here. I would urge caution, since you will have a very hard time 
&gt; cashing out this intellectual loan.

True, I am relying heavily on the notion of granularity and I would have a
difficult time fully axiomatizing this notion, I'm sure.  However, I don't
see that we're required to axiomatize this notion.  Of course, it would be
nice if we could specify this notion with necessary and sufficient
conditions, but there are doubtless going to be some primitive concepts in
the ontology, and granularity looks to me to be a good candidate for this
category.

&gt; 
&gt; By the way, what do you mean that the surface has a granularity for 
&gt; the stuff? Surfaces are not made of stuff, surely (if they were, they 
&gt; would have properties like mass and density.) Or do you mean, the 
&gt; stuff of which the object is composed? If so, I fail to see quite 
&gt; what that has to do with the notion of surface. You need to be very 
&gt; careful about topology here. What do you mean by a part being AT a 
&gt; surface? The part can't be literally inside the surface or literally 
&gt; share the surface's location, since you can't get a 3-d thing (even a 
&gt; very thin one) inside a 2-d thing. (I'm assuming here that the 
&gt; surface itself isn't the part; if it is, then there are other, 
&gt; different problems.) Have you tried stating this condition carefully?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;A superficial part could be similar in every
&gt; &gt;relevant respect to a non-superficial part, because I think 
&gt; we're all agreed
&gt; &gt;that relevant respects do not encompass locative properties.
&gt; 
&gt; We are? I was going to ask you what 'relevant respect' meant, in 
&gt; fact, and how you were going to axiomatize it. Maybe you could expand 
&gt; on this point a little.

My response is just what I said above.  Since 'instance-of' requires a class
as its second argument, we don't have to worry about the sort of silly
properties that seem to concern you.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Finally, part
&gt; &gt;of what makes a part superficial is that it is located at 
&gt; the surface of the
&gt; &gt;object.
&gt; 
&gt; That doesnt quite make sense, since a part is 3-d and a surface is 
&gt; 2-d. What you might mean (?) is that the part is in contact with the 
&gt; surface, or that part of its surface is part of the surface of the 
&gt; whole thing of which it is a part, ie it shares some of the whole 
&gt; thing's surface. But even that will not do, presumably, since that 
&gt; would also apply to the whole object. I really don't see any way to 
&gt; characterize 'superfical part' in terms of location alone.

I agree.  I think I spoke too loosely.  Casati and Varzi, from whose book
the notion is taken, characterize a "superficial part" as a part which does
not have an "interior part".

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. An action is a subclass of a HumanCaused Process, which makes
&gt; &gt; &gt; actions by animals, computers and other machines 
&gt; logically impossible.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It all depends on how you define the notion of 'Action'.  
&gt; One can draw a
&gt; &gt;distinction between events that are intentional and the result of
&gt; &gt;deliberation and events that are not.  This sort of 
&gt; distinction, you are
&gt; &gt;right, leaves (most) animals, robots, etc. out of the picture.
&gt; 
&gt; No, it does not. Certainly many animals, and arguably also some 
&gt; machines, can act as the result of deliberation and with intention.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a highly contentious area of academic debate, as I expect you 
&gt; know. It is inappropriate for a standard ontology to take a stance 
&gt; (particularly such a narrow-minded and rather archaic stance) on such 
&gt; an issue, and have this stance welded into its categorization 
&gt; heirarchy.
&gt; 
&gt; This alone would be sufficient for me to refuse to ever use the 
&gt; ontology and to recommend that it never be used in any scientific 
&gt; context. I mean, ask yourself. Here I am in AI and cognitive science, 
&gt; and I'm expected to agree to using an ontology which is built on the 
&gt; assumption that the basic scientific hypotheses of my chosen field 
&gt; are false *by definition* ?? You might as well ask an MD to use an 
&gt; ontology which is based on the 4 humors.
&gt; (I actually feel rather strongly about this because I think that the 
&gt; idea that only human beings have intentionality is close to immoral; 
&gt; but my point is not that you should agree with me on this, but that 
&gt; the SUO shouldnt have such narrow-minded prejudices built into it.)

OK, how about we replace the term "HumanCausedProcess" with
"IntentionallyCausedProcess" and revise the corresponding axiom accordingly.
How does that sound?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, it
&gt; &gt;is a crucial concept - in fact, our legal system is founded on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Then put it into a legal ontology, not a general-pupose one. 
&gt; Ethology, psychology, and much of biology and philosophy explicitly 
&gt; denies it, and a denial of it is a cornerstone of cognitive science.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If one
&gt; &gt;wants to create a more general concept that includes both 
&gt; 'Action', as
&gt; &gt;currently defined, and the things that animals and robots do, this is
&gt; &gt;possible in the framework of the merged ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; That is not an adequate response. In this sense anything is possible. 
&gt; One could simply ignore the categories in the ontology and invent 
&gt; ones own.  The issue is the extent to which the SUO reflects 
&gt; reasonably widely accepted categorizations. If "animal" and "human" 
&gt; and "action" and so on have arbitrary definitions that reflect a 
&gt; particular narrow view of the world which is inconsistent with large 
&gt; areas of current science, then there is something badly wrong with it 
&gt; as a proposed SUO.

Well, we haven't yet taken up the definitions of 'Animal' and 'Human'.  Why
don't you have a look at them and see if they're to your liking.  As for
'Action', I suggest that we make it a subclass of the newly minted class
'IntentionallyCausedProcess'.
