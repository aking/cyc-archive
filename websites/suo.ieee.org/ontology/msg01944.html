Philip,

	Comments inserted:


1) Should we have any formally designated working documents at all at this
point? (yes, no, abstain)

JS: Any member can propose any document at any time.  If seconded, it must
be put to a vote.  The vote determines whether it is mature enough.  You
can't tell someone they can't propose a document because you don't think it
is mature enough.  All you can do is vote against it.  

2) Should any documents be designated as preeminent over others at this
point? (yes, no, abstain)

JS: Listing them in the order of approval is probably the fairest. 

3) If we have working documents, what procedure should be followed to
designate something as a working document (Choose one):

A) A vote requiring a plurality of voting members in favor of the document?

Majority vote, with Abstains not counted, is what I've always seen.  SUO has
about 50 voting members, but only 24 cast votes in the straw poll. 
A plurality is too high a barrier.

B) Any voting member may submit a document and it is automatically
recognized as a working document?

JS: I see no way we can allow a single member to commit this WG to working
on a document.  The chair would need to monitor things like fairness,
openness, due process, copyright permissions, etc. A Technical Editor would
need to be appointed/selected and would need to get group approval before
making changes.   Even if we voted in favor of this, I expect IEEE would
overrule us.  Besides, doesn't the group want to have a say in what we are
working on, and what we are viewed as working on. I also think we wouldn't
want to be working on more than a handful of documents.  We can achieve this
same end by permitting anyone to submit any document, seek informal
participation, and voluntarily follow the rules of IEEE, but NOT have any
official status as a group project.  When ready, it could be proposed as a
group effort.

C) TBD.

I would like to open the question of whether we should have such a vote for
discussion by all concerned. Maybe this is something that is already clearly
established in the procedures for IEEE working groups? If not, we may need
to establish it for SUO...



JS: I believe the ideas I'm suggesting are already covered and don't need a
vote.

Jim
