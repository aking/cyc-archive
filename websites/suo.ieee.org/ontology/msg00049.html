Jon,
   John has not yet commented on this file.  I believe he intends to do so 
in the next few weeks.

&gt;Adam, Chris, Ian, &amp; KIF'n Cousins All,
&gt;
&gt;I had been reserving my comments on this translation
&gt;of John Sowa's "Top Level Categories" (TLC) into KIF
&gt;until such time as the author himself could have his
&gt;say on the result.  As that earnestly to be desired
&gt;outcome does not appear to be forthcoming any time
&gt;soon, or in any sort of direct way, and it has just
&gt;now occurred to me -- duh! -- that perhaps this has
&gt;already happened in one of those apparently all the
&gt;more frequent off-list discussion and decision-making
&gt;bodies with which this ostensibly "open" forum has now
&gt;saddled itself, I guess that I might as well go ahead
&gt;and toss my tuppence worth into the pot, as it were.
&gt;
&gt;I would like to try and make at least one thing clear right here
&gt;at the beginning, so that nobody takes any of this too personally
&gt;or too pointedly, namely, that most of what I have to say is not
&gt;specific to KIF, not by any means, but would apply equally well
&gt;to that whole tradition of formalities in logic that have come
&gt;to be foist-order-lodged in our intellects by the lights and
&gt;by the likes of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein.
&gt;
&gt;I also think that it might contribute to our mutual understanding
&gt;if I explain one or two aspects of my own background.  I was not
&gt;always this skeptical about the potential of FOL as we know it --
&gt;I came by my aporetics quite honestly, in the way that I have had
&gt;to learn all of my lessons, the hard way, through disappointment
&gt;in following through with my former beliefs.  I was once in fact
&gt;what you might call a "True Believer" in the point of view that
&gt;used to be known as "logicism", namely, the idea that every form
&gt;of mathematical reasoning reduces to a matter of deductive logic.
&gt;This is the POV that I took into my graduate studies in maths,
&gt;and this is the POV that I revived yet another time when I set
&gt;about trying to develop qualitative methods in psychology, and
&gt;this is the angle at which I just had to keep on butting my head,
&gt;one more time for good measure, when I tried to integrate my early
&gt;efforts into a try at AI.  Now, a person takes an obvious risk in
&gt;airing out his own failed trials in this way -- it is so easy for
&gt;anybody to say "Well, that's just him" and go back to trying the
&gt;same old, same old things for all that anybody's worth, one more
&gt;time, with a few innovations, always a few more novelties to try.
&gt;
&gt;But I will go ahead, anyway, and state the lesson that I, for one,
&gt;learned from my honest, if naive, attempts, and that is just that
&gt;formalisms like the "logic of deductive inference" (LODI) and the
&gt;"theory of classes and sets" (TOCAS) are perfectly -- well, almost
&gt;perfectly -- good forms of representation for succintly summarizing
&gt;what you have discovered, at any rate, once you have discovered it
&gt;usually by any other means possible, in what is often called the
&gt;"context of justification and review" (COJAR), but that these
&gt;brands of formalism are darn near useless and a positivistic
&gt;nuisance when it comes to the discovery phases of the overall
&gt;"context of inquiry" (COI) itself.
&gt;
&gt;Well, all of my pre-ambling took longer than I thought it would,
&gt;and so I will have to break now and try to get back to the main
&gt;part of your translation piece later.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Jon Awbrey

&gt; &gt; Folks,
&gt; &gt;    Here is an SUO-KIF version of John Sowa's upper level ontology

&gt; &gt; ;; METALINGUISTIC DEFINITIONS
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;; Metalinguistic definitions provide us with theoretical
&gt; &gt; ;; justifications for the use of certain syntactic abbreviations that

&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;; The "nth-domain" provides a computationally and heuristically
&gt; &gt; ;; convenient mechanism for declaring the intended types of the
&gt; &gt; ;; argument places of a given relation.  It cannot be considered a
&gt; &gt; ;; genuine predicate in a standard first-order language as it takes
&gt; &gt; ;; first-order predicates as arguments.  Furthermore, it also takes
&gt; &gt; ;; numerals as arguments, which are not part of first-order languages
&gt; &gt; ;; generally.  However, it can be understood formally as an abbreviation
&gt; &gt; ;; as follows.
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;; Let REL be any n-place predicate, and let M be the numeral
&gt; &gt; ;; for the positive integer m, where m is less than or equal to n.
&gt; &gt; ;; Then we let
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;   (nth-domain REL M CLASS)
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;; serve as an abbreviation for
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;   (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
&gt; &gt; ;;           (=&gt; (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
&gt; &gt; ;;               (instance-of VAR_m CLASS)))
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;; More generally, let M_1, ..., M_i be the numerals for
&gt; &gt; ;; positive integers m_1, ..., m_i, ordered by size, all
&gt; &gt; ;; less than or equal to n.  Then, in general, we let
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;   (nth-domain REL M_1 CLASS_1 ... M_i CLASS_i)
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;; abbreviate
&gt; &gt; ;;
&gt; &gt; ;;   (forall (VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
&gt; &gt; ;;           (=&gt; (REL VAR_1 ... VAR_n)
&gt; &gt; ;;               (and (instance-of VAR_m_1 CLASS_1)

&gt; &gt; ;; constants, primitive predicates, and defined predicates are
&gt; &gt; ;; listed below.  Note that among the primitive predicates are
&gt; &gt; ;; several (e.g., "exists-at") that are borrowed from other ontologies --
&gt; &gt; ;; moreover, those predicates may be *defined* in those ontologies.
&gt; &gt; ;; Eventually, of course, it will be important to have mechanisms
&gt; &gt; ;; for making such connections explicitly (via, e.g., something
&gt; &gt; ;; like Ontolingua packages).
