must be the season for afterthoughts, said jon epimetheusly ...

i feel like i have known people who loved syntax for its own sake --
yet i am just as sure that they would deny it under interrogation --
but you must know that it stings my pragmatic sensibilities to be
accused of that particular perversion myself, and i warrant you
that it's the brand of thing that i had to be dragged kicking
and screaming into doing, all for the sake of teaching logic
to rocks, and i do not mean the inhabitants of roswell, nm.

anyway, there is a curious sort of pragmatic/semiotic phenomenon that i have
noticed in this connection.  if you have been following this thread, you may
have kenned the fact that it's largely about a particular way of approaching
the meaningfulness of formal or logical or mathematical symbol systems, that
is to say, &quot;model theory&quot; or &quot;semantics&quot;, all without making a federal case
of it, but just doing what comes naturally to practitioners of these arts,
what is, in effect, a &quot;pay as you get on&quot; (paygo) account of one's models.

in one sense, this approach cares very little for notation.  as soon as
you stand and declare a type, say, &quot;X&quot;, or &quot;X -&gt; Y&quot;, or &quot;(X -&gt; Y) -&gt; Z&quot;,
then you feel pretty secure in the knowledge that there really is such
a space of things in the world -- some world or another -- and you just
get on from there without much upset at the outset, blithely going on
with your thinking just as if you really were talking about these
putative objects of your discussion.

of course, what it is that this play of denoting ethereal objects
and this work of describing earthly patterns of stuff that happen
to be going on in the world have to do with each other is just
a bit of a stretch (q.v.), but all of that is another story.

but the funny thing is -- no sooner do you shift your main
attention to the main attraction than you start to notice
that your ability describe it effectively and to reason
about its more interesting features will tend to leave
leave your tongue tied to the particulars of the very
syntax that you are using to think about it, and to
tell others, including the computer, about it.

strange, no?

i think so.

DM: How interesting!  In all your previous uses of this set of categories,
    I think you have alway labeled them as Sowa's.  Because I've known you
    were working on notation, and because I've read John's work, I stopped
    paying attention to the content.  This time they appeared in a context
    where they stood out, and without explicit attribution.  In that form,
    seen &quot;fresh&quot;, they sure didn't strike me as the twelve most salient
    and orthogonal distinctions that could be made about the world.
    How interesting ...

DM: I know that you are presenting the following as an example of your
    preferred style of notation.  At the same time, however, you seem to
    be making a claim for the meaningfulness of the &quot;even dozen&quot; categories.

JA: here i was just following the time-hallowed-if-not-quite-forgotten practice
    of trying to apply my favorite methods to somebody else's favorite examples,
    in this case, john sowa's &quot;top level catgories&quot; (tlc).  to be honest, i am
    not even sure if i have gotten the intention of the ontology correct, and
    js has not yet responded to my requests for instruction on that score,
    so i am just having to go with my best initial guess.

JA: still, even with all of those hedges about all of my bets, the example,
    as i construe it, is interesting enough in its own right, and the full
    picture has a sufficient number (n = 25) of logical variables to make
    it not entirely trivial at this stage of the game.

here's a partial history of the discussion so far:

DM: I wonder if you are really serious about your assertion that these twelve
    &quot;partition ... the relevant universe of discourse into ... categories of
    the exhaustive and mutually exclusive sort&quot;?  Maybe this is just a toy
    example of the kind that the notation-obsessed use to fill the slots
    of some shining syntactic bauble?  Or do you really mean that any and
    every domain can be partitioned thus, and that this is a particularly
    meaningful (or maybe the only correct?) partitioning scheme?  I think
    you must mean it as a toy, and so won't belabor it here, except to ask,
    cursorily, how you distinguish a purpose from a reason, a script from
    a history, or a description from the whole melange?

JA: not my example, and my reading of it is still hedged with uncertainty,
    so you need to ask js if his intentions are honorable -- i was just
    assuming that he took it seriously.  this gang of twelve was the
    bottom of the top twenty-five, and so i gather that what tells
    them from each other would be the conjunctions of features
    that circumscribe them from above, as viewed from their
    several places in the hierarchy, if i read that right.
    see the rest of the lattice and my transcription
    of it at these locations:

JS: <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm</A>

JA: <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg03571.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg03571.html</A>

DM, quoting JL:

    &quot;Imagine all the people ... living life in peace.&quot;

JA: Yet another afterthought, just by way of a light exercise
    to illustrate the kinds of scaling issues that arise with
    regard to zeroth order theories as we try to amble across
    the spectra from abstract logical principles to realistic
    computational practice, you might consider the following
    cactoid calculus constraint that expresses the partition
    of the relevant universe of discourse into an even dozen
    categories of the exhaustive and mutually exclusive sort:

JA, transcribing JS:

    |  (( Object      ),( Process       ),( Schema      ),( Script  ),
    |   ( Juncture    ),( Participation ),( Description ),( History ),
    |   ( Structure   ),( Situation     ),( Reason      ),( Purpose ))

JA: To understand what this expression says, you merely have to recall
    that a bracket of the form &quot;(x_i)&quot; says &quot;not x_i&quot;, while a bracket
    of the form &quot;(y_1, y_2, ..., y_11, y_12)&quot; says that exactly one of
    the y_j, for j = 1 to 12, is false.  Therefore, an expression like

    (( x_1 ),( x_2 ), ..., ( x_11 ),( x_12 ))

    avers that exactly one of the x_i is true.  This is the expression
    of a partition on the universe of discourse, in this case dividing
    it up into exactly 12 exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories.

JA: Observe that the number of variable tokens that are needed in this
    form of expression is a linear function, often described as &quot;O(x)&quot;,
    in the number of categories, and this reflects the real complexity
    in computational terms of working with this particular syntax when
    it comes to expressing and reasoning with partition constraints.

JA: For the sake of contrast, you might consider how you would express
    a k-fold partition constraint in the customary pentaglyphic syntax
    of pseudo-primitives {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;} and then reflect
    on how the candidate expression grows with regard to the number of
    clauses and the number of variable tokens as k increases.
