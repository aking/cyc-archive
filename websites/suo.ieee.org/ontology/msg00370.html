The idea of a *hypercase* ["Case Grammar Applied" (1998) by Walter A.
Cook] -- where, for example, the hypercase *agent* represents the subject of
the verb action or what produces or causes the verb action, and the
hypercase *object* represents the entity being described, moved, affected,
created, or undergoing neutral change -- may argue for the legitimacy of a
2ndness (prehension) metaclass, a metaclass of cases, with various natural
language ontologies filling out an ontology of cases such as the following:

- case
  - agent
    - animate agent
    - instrument
    - force of nature
  - object (or theme)
    - patient
    - undergoer
    - affected entity
    - complement
    - neutral
    - factitive

&gt;
&gt; Pat, John and others,
&gt;
&gt; So I propose that we partition things into three fundamental
*metaclasses*,
&gt; which, if the CSPers will pardon me, I will call 3rdness, 2ndness and
&gt; 1stness. And that we assume the existence of two embedding metafunctions
&gt; that reify 3rdness into 1stness, and at the same time transform the
linking
&gt; 2ndness into a 3rdness. I also assume that 2ndness is relative -- there is
&gt; no absolutely required 2ndness. This framework has already aided me in
&gt; defining category-based metatheories for logical languages and models.
&gt; _______________________
&gt;
&gt; III. 3rdness (nexus) (the central thing)
&gt; Represented idea: verb sense, situation, eventuality, state of affairs,
&gt; relation, CG conceptual relation
&gt;
&gt; II. 2ndness (prehension) (the spokes or connecting links, possibly
&gt; partitioned into *obligatory case* and *optional case*)
&gt; Represented idea: case (thematic role), argument index, CG arc
&gt; Examples:
&gt; [who?] -- agent -- (agentive case)
&gt; [using?] -- instrument -- (instrumental case)
&gt; [what?] -- them(atic) object -- (objective case)
&gt; [to(for) whom?] -- recipient (patient) -- (dative case)
&gt; [where?] -- location -- (locative case)
&gt; [when?] --  time (tense) -- (temporal case)
&gt; [why1?] -- purpose
&gt; [why2?] -- cause
&gt; [how?] -- manner
&gt; -- epistemic source
&gt; -- type
&gt;
&gt; I. 1stness (actual entities) (the peripheral things)
&gt; Represented idea: noun, (argument) entity, CG concept

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, I still don't understand why relations

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Jon Awbrey responded:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A k-adic (-ary, -valent) relation with a time dimension adjoined
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is just a special kind of a (k+1)-adic (-ary, -valent) relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Time is a very important aspect of "context", but it's only
&gt; &gt; &gt;one of many ways of classifying contexts.  Place is another
&gt; &gt; &gt;important aspect.  Combining place and time in a 4-D system
&gt; &gt; &gt;is useful, but it still doesn't capture all the possible ways
&gt; &gt; &gt;of classifying contexts.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Other useful classifications include the people involved, the
&gt; &gt; &gt;general subject matter, the ontology used to classify the
&gt; &gt; &gt;subject, the reporter who reported the information, etc., etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Example:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The sentence "A cat is on a mat" could be represented by
&gt; &gt; &gt;the following conceptual graph (which could be translated
&gt; &gt; &gt;to KIF or any other logic-based notation):
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;   [Cat]-&gt;(On)-&gt;[Mat].
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The dyadic relation (On) could be augmented with arbitrarily
&gt; &gt; &gt;many additional arguments, coordinates, attributes, or whatever
&gt; &gt; &gt;you want to call them:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (On)-
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -1-&gt;[Cat]
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -2-&gt;[Mat]
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -3-&gt;[Time: &lt;2001, Jan, 11, 16:12:05 UCT&gt;]
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -4-&gt;[Location: &lt;73W 53' 35", 41N 12' 27"&gt;]
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -5-&gt;[Reporter: 'John F. Sowa']
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Instead of stuffing all that information into the relation,
&gt; &gt; &gt;it is possible to wrap the original graph (or formula or
&gt; &gt; &gt;sentence or statement) in a context wrapper of type Situation
&gt; &gt; &gt;and then to add additional links to the context box:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;   [Situation: [Cat]-&gt;(On)-&gt;[Mat] ]-
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -&gt;(Ptim)-&gt;[Time: &lt;2001, Jan, 11, 16:12:05 UCT&gt;]
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -&gt;(Loc)-&gt;[Location: &lt;73W 53' 35", 41N 12' 27"&gt;]
&gt; &gt; &gt;      -&gt;(ReportedBy)-&gt;[Person: 'John F. Sowa']
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This CG could be read as the English sentence "There existed
&gt; &gt; &gt;a situation of a cat on a mat at the point in time 2001 Jan 11
&gt; &gt; &gt;16:12:05 UCT at the latitude 73W 53' 35" and longitude 41N 12' 27"
&gt; &gt; &gt;as reported by the person John F. Sowa."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;To represent this CG in KIF, one might introduce a dyadic
&gt; &gt; &gt;relation Dscr (description), whose first argument is some
&gt; &gt; &gt;entity that is described by a quoted proposition as its second
&gt; &gt; &gt;argument:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;   (exists ((?s Situation))
&gt; &gt; &gt;      (and (Dscr ?s '(exists ((?x Cat) (?y Mat)) (On ?x ?y)))
&gt; &gt; &gt;           (Ptim...  )
&gt; &gt; &gt;           (Loc...   )
&gt; &gt; &gt;           (ReportedBy... ) ))
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The dots indicate some conventions that the SUO might specify
&gt; &gt; &gt;for representing times, locations, and other information.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Fine with all this, John.  But a few questions....
&gt; &gt; 1. Why not go the whole hog and have the cat, and the mat and even
&gt; &gt; the sitting, as aspects of the situations? After all, it seems that
&gt; &gt; the choice of these to put into a sentence representing content, as
&gt; &gt; opposed to being kind of apppendages, is rather arbitrary: the text
&gt; &gt; could have started :"John Sowa saw it happen one afternoon...". If
&gt; &gt; one pursues that line, one gets to a representation very similar to
&gt; &gt; case grammar, where there is just a central 'thing', which might be
&gt; &gt; called variously a situation, a proposition,  an eventuality, or a
&gt; &gt; state of affairs, or whatever, (it is whatever is basically expressed
&gt; &gt; by a simple sentence, is the idea) and it has a largish class of
&gt; &gt; known relations with various categories of other thing: the type (a
&gt; &gt; sitting, in this case), an agent, a subject, a time and a place, an
&gt; &gt; epistemic source, whatever. (Extra ones can be added later, which is
&gt; &gt; a handly contrast to the representational technique which insists on
&gt; &gt; putting them in as arguments to a relation.) Some of these other
&gt; &gt; things can themselves be situations, allowing us  to talk (with some
&gt; &gt; care) about various kinds of aspect or intentionality relationships.
&gt; &gt; I suspect you will agree with all this, in fact.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. On the other hand, quite what ARE these central things to which
&gt; &gt; the other things are related? This is where I tend to get a little
&gt; &gt; lost. I know what propositions are, more or less (I think of them as
&gt; &gt; equivalence classes of sentences under logical equivalence, more  or
&gt; &gt; less), and I know what times and places are, and I know what people
&gt; &gt; are, and so on. More or less. But I really don't know what
&gt; &gt; 'situations' ARE: and without some idea about that, I don't have any
&gt; &gt; way to evaluate anything that anyone might say about them. To follow
&gt; &gt; the line that Nicola has always emphasised, I don't know what the
&gt; &gt; identity conditions for situations would be.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have met several extremal views on this, and they all make a kind
&gt; &gt; of sense. On one view, a situation is basically a fragment of the
&gt; &gt; world: some selected aspects of the way the world actually is.
&gt; &gt; (Leaving aside issues about imaginary things, etc., for now.) On that
&gt; &gt; view, for example, a fast walking and a slow travelling might well be
&gt; &gt; the same situation, described in two different ways. This is the
&gt; &gt; usual view among linguists, oddly enough, as far as I can determine.
&gt; &gt; On another view, a situation is more like a piece of information
&gt; &gt; about the world, and the 'same' physical situation might be a
&gt; &gt; different information-situation depending on how it is described. It
&gt; &gt; is impossible to describe the same situation in different ways: the
&gt; &gt; differences in the descriptions are already sufficient to distinguish
&gt; &gt; the described situations from one another. This is what Barwise
&gt; &gt; apparently meant in 'Situation Theory', and what Hobbs means in his
&gt; &gt; promiscuous ontology. The intuitions get even odder when one thinks
&gt; &gt; of more complicated descriptions. If there are two cats sitting on
&gt; &gt; the same mat, is this one or two situations? How about the same cat
&gt; &gt; sitting on two different mats? (Why the disparity, if there is one?)
&gt; &gt; Can situations be characterised by conditionals or disjunctions or
&gt; &gt; negations?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, both of these seem to me to be reasonable answers to my basic
&gt; &gt; question (though I prefer the first one, myself.) But Im really not
&gt; &gt; sure what your answer is: sometimes you seem to prefer the 'physical'
&gt; &gt; way of thinking and sometimes the 'information' way, so there seems
&gt; &gt; to be a kind of hybrid view in there somewhere, but I can't quite
&gt; &gt; discern what it is. (Maybe, perish the thought, I need to understand
&gt; &gt; Peirce first...?)
