Jim,

With respect to the Main SUO Work I am but a &quot;mildly intersted onlooker&quot;
at this point.  I have unsubscribed from the main list and removed its
address from my address book, so unless I inadvertently hit &lt;reply-all&gt;
you should not have gotten any e-mail from me on that line since the
message of Mon, 09 Jul 2001 19:40:38 -0400 on &quot;Quantity of Postings&quot;
that I have attached for your reference.  The message that you reply
to here was sent to the &quot;ONT&quot; Sublist, as you have often requested.
The Archives have been down all week so I have no way of knowing
if the Archiver is cross-listing stuff.

All The Best Wishes,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; 
&gt; Please take this as a friendly request.
&gt; 
&gt; Your volume of postings is again back to a very high level.
&gt; Please be careful to post only those messages that contribute
&gt; to the scope of this project.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not been reading your recent threat [thread?] on inquiry.
&gt; Obviously it relates to ontology and probably even to an upper ontology,
&gt; but then everything under the sun does.  Is there a direct connection
&gt; that would justify this discussion on the SUO list.  If not, could
&gt; you move it to the Ontology list?  
&gt;

&gt; | Although it is better to be methodical in our investigations,

&gt; By way of giving this question a proper form of inaugural,
&gt; I thought that I would share with you some of my favorite
&gt; quotations on the subject of inquiry, each one reflecting
&gt; a different facet of this resplendently fascinating topic.
&gt; 
&gt; With regard to the bearing of the more poetic expressions,
&gt; I will leave you now to your own contemplations, and, for
&gt; the moment and the immediate future, I will focus on what
&gt; is evidently the most prosaic and derivative of the bunch,
&gt; where I think it sufficient to echo Peirce's echo of Kant.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that this statement forms a cardinal expression --
&gt; embodying the heart and serving as the hinge -- for a very
&gt; important principle, one that goes a large part of the way
&gt; toward explaining how the information that is stored up in
&gt; an ontology, a &quot;body of ontological knowledge&quot; (BOOK), can
&gt; work to inform the progress of inquiries on which it bears.

&gt; 
&gt; Could I make a friendly request?  I think you'll agree you post more
&gt; messages to the SUO list than anyone else.  As such, could you take
&gt; special care to post only those messages that directly contribute
&gt; to the objectives of this group.

Jim,

I know that it will surprise some people if I say it,
but other than the sort of chatter that it takes just
to have any kind of community feeling at all, that is
all that I have been trying to do since the very start.

I think that it would be good if we had some systematic way of
analyzing our stated goals in relation to the resources that we
already have in our command, the capacities that we need to build,
the obstacles that we need to overcome, and the problems that we 
need to solve -- just the way that most programmer types would
go about tackling any goal-hacking task -- but I do not see
that happening here, so why fight it?

I understand that different people have different ideas about what will
contribute to building a SUO, but unless this working group comes up with
an effective task-analytic method for the job, I think that it will just
go on with a process of seeing who can shout who down.  What I do not
understand is why somebody who believes that he or she has something
positive and constructive to contribute to his or her vision of what
a SUO should be would even waste the time that it takes to write yet
another one of those messages that say in effect &quot;I will not bring
my Imperial Circus to your town unless you clear the Arena first!&quot;

My guess is that there is a problematic dynamic affecting this community that
will not be solved by the stifling of one poet or the scaping of one goat, but
my guess is also that you will all insist on discovering that for yourself, and
I am tired of trying to second guess the perceptions of relevance that may or may
not be in somebody else's head, so I believe that the best solution for me and for
everybody else is just for me retire completely to the Ontology sublist heneceforth.

I am posting this to the whole group so that I won't be able to go back on it.

All The Best Wishes,

Jon Awbrey
