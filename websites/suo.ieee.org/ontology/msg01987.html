&gt; There is a serious problem whose implications have great
&gt; pragmatic significance for the SUO, the semantic web, and,
&gt; in general, any computer system that uses multiple languages
&gt; and must be able to translate messages from one to another:

This is a problem of great interest to me.  In a sense, though not
always with full awareness of the fact, I have been working on it
my whole life -- more consciously and deliberately since at least
the late 60's, when Susan and I had our first intense discussions
about the issues of translating among figurative, graphical, and
literal languages for doing, say, mathematics or other sciences,
and all of the associated questions about representational versus
non-representational styles of artistic and cognitive expression.
These early conversations eventually issued in her dissertation:

My own path has been slightly more fractal in the dimension of its tangles!

So you see, I am quite serious in my dedication
to these questions -- No April FOL's need apply! --
but at the moment you are pushing me beyond my
half-self-imposed half-other-imposed working
limitations, which I arrived at in the way of
all goal-reductive tactics by putting a stake
in ideal imaginary grounds, and then rappling
backwards until I could feel my intellectual
feet touch some level that was solid enough
to walk on.  And that is why I must continue
to carry on in this pedestrian peripathetic
manner of trying to cope with COPE's first
before moving on, or trying to fly any higher.
Even Icarus is capable of learning, if he gets
burned enough times, and survives the dunking.

So I will have to stick to the Zeroth Order of Alpha Numb Logic for a while --
I honestly believe that if we can't make it there we can't make it anywhere.

&gt;  1. What does it mean to say that distinct sentence types
&gt;     in one or more languages (natural languages, programming
&gt;     languages, versions of logic, or whatever) can be said
&gt;     to "express the same meaning"?

Later this summer, when I go for my two week Shakespeare immersion,
I will no doubt have the opportunity to reflect on what 'Hamlet'
means to me in the first year of the new millennium -- but soft,
let me check:

<A  HREF="http://www.stratford-festival.on.ca/">http://www.stratford-festival.on.ca/</A>

Nope, not this year.  So let's just say that I will have the occasion
to think about the meaning of 'Twelfth Night' to me in the year 2001.
And I can already see that the assembled company is going to do their
darnedest to help me see a different side of the Dodecanycton than the
last time I raised my starry eyes toward some reflection in that Zodiac.

<A  HREF="http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/2001/playbill/twelfthnight.html">http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/2001/playbill/twelfthnight.html</A>

Does anybody seriously think that we are anywhere near the point of
being able to webicize tangles of receiptful meaning such as these?

&gt;  2. How can we formulate an answer to that question in a way
&gt;     that is effectively computable, at least for the more
&gt;     formalized of those languages?

I Kant.

&gt;  3. Some logicians have proposed some answers, but
&gt;     they have glaring deficiencies.  Richard Montague,
&gt;     for example, defined the intension of a sentence to
&gt;     be a function from possible worlds to truth values.
&gt;     Some problems with that definition:
&gt; 
&gt;     a) All theorems of mathematics and anything else that is
&gt;        true by definition would turn out to have exactly the
&gt;        same "intension", since they are true in all possible
&gt;        worlds.
&gt; 
&gt;     b) For the purpose of the SUO, one would hope that the
&gt;        axioms and definitions would be true in quite a few,
&gt;        if not all possible worlds, and Montague's definition
&gt;        would not be able to distinguish much, if any difference
&gt;        in "meaning" among any of them.
&gt; 
&gt;     c) Possible worlds are very difficult to reach by any
&gt;        commercial transportation service, but provability
&gt;        can be used instead:  two sentences that are provably
&gt;        equivalent must be true in all possible worlds.  However,
&gt;        provability in general is NP-complete, and the algorithms
&gt;        would take exponential time to verify.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem to be solved:  Consider the informal definition
&gt; of "proposition" as "the meaning of a sentence".  And find
&gt; some suitable formal definition, which at least for formalized
&gt; languages is efficently computable and able to distinguish finer
&gt; differences of meaning than Montague's approach.

I will have to come back to these items next time.

&gt; Certainly, "2+2=4" should not have the same "meaning" or "intension"
&gt; as Fermat's last theorem.  Even "2+3=5" should be considered distinct
&gt; from "2+2=4".

Even as "5 + 7" has a different meaning than "12", to refined enough eyes.

&gt; &gt; Yes, but, er, if your patent formulations did not compare
&gt; &gt; in some favorable way with what is ordinarily understood
&gt; &gt; by the words "meaning" and "proposition",
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, there is no well-defined "ordinarily understood"
&gt; definition of those terms.

There are two or three well-recognized aspects of meaning,
dimensions of address, or directions of approach that are
broadly and commonly marked out, especially within any
pragmatic theory of signs, Peircean style, namely, the
aspect of a 3-adic sign relation that has to do with
the 2-adic relation between objects and signs, and,
in contrast, the aspect of a 3-adic sign relation
that has to do with the 2-adic relation between
signs and interpretant signs.  I simply do not
understand people's hesitancy, yours especially,
to use this rather well worked-out terminology
and body of techniques for analyzing real-live
sign relations, or even just simplified models.

&gt; The definition that I proposed makes finer distinctions than Montague's,
&gt; it distinguishes "2+2=4" from "2+3=5", and it can be computed in linear
&gt; or nearly linear time.  And, most importantly, it corresponds rather
&gt; closely to informal intuitions about differences of meaning.

Again, OS (denotative) or OI (connotative) meaning?
I am not even trying to eliminate one in favor of
the other.  The former is much more concerned with
recognizing the "coincidences" of objective meaning
between "2+2" and "4", or between "2+2=4" &amp; "2+3=5",
than it is with preserving all of the nuances of the
potential distinctions between them.  Neither account
of "meaning" is sufficient to all of our purposes, so
why not keep and continue to develop both?  However,
the later realm is much more unruly, and not likely
to be "tamed" without risk of laying waste to it.

&gt; &gt; or unless you are able to give some account of these concepts
&gt; &gt; that is independent of formal symbolic manipulations, then it
&gt; &gt; appears that you are already bound to charge yourself with the
&gt; &gt; fault that -- how did you put it when you consigned my calculus
&gt; &gt; to the Frege-Russell line? -- "treats the rules of [translation]
&gt; &gt; as primitives that are not justified by their effects on truth
&gt; &gt; conditions", thus infringing the definition and the horizon of
&gt; &gt; logic as "the formal conditions for the truth of representations",
&gt; &gt; in effect, reversing the bias that is more usual of buying the
&gt; &gt; emphasis "formal" at the expense of "truth" and "representation".
&gt; 
&gt; To be formal, it is essential to define the procedure in terms
&gt; of syntactic operations.  My criticism of Frege was not that he
&gt; used syntactic operations.  That is also what Peirce, Tarski, and
&gt; everyone else does.  The difference is that everyone from Aristotle
&gt; to Peirce and Tarski recognized that the ultimate justification for
&gt; those syntactic operations is their connection with the universe of
&gt; discourse to which the vocabulary and indexicals of the language refer.

This is such a beautiful statement that I will not equivel
with the lesser point of whether it yet captures quite all
that Peirce meant by "formal".  That will keep until later.

&gt; The four criteria for a meaning-preserving translation (MPT)
&gt; have the following justification:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Invertible:  If sentence s is mapped to another sentence
&gt;     f(s), which is said to have the same meaning, then it should
&gt;     also be possible to map f(s) back to another sentence that
&gt;     has "the same meaning".
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Proof preserving:  The rules of inference in each language
&gt;     under consideration must be justified by truth conditions,
&gt;     in the sense of everybody from Aristotle to Peirce and
&gt;     Tarski.  Therefore, the syntactic operations on proofs
&gt;     have a direct link to corresponding semantic operations.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Vocabulary preserving:  The content words of any language
&gt;     must be linked to the universe of discourse by triadic
&gt;     sign relations.  Therefore, preserving the vocabulary is
&gt;     a prerequisite to preserving the referential connections.
&gt; 
&gt;  4. Structure preserving:  By structure, I mean the minimal logical form
&gt;     preserved by Peirce's EGs (existence, conjunction, and negation).
&gt;     Existence is much simpler and easier to verify pragmatically
&gt;     than the universal quantifier, conjunction is pragmatically
&gt;     the least controversial of all the Boolean operators, and
&gt;     negation is essential to support at least FOL.  Peirce gave
&gt;     many, many pragmatic discussions of the interpretation of
&gt;     negations in his graphs, and his arguments can be assumed
&gt;     for this purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; These four conditions can be verified by purely syntactic
&gt; tests, but each of them is justified by pragmatic reasons.
&gt; 
&gt; Another important point:  although my condition #2 is the
&gt; same as Montague's, condition #4 of structure preserving
&gt; makes the proofs almost trivial:  any two statements that
&gt; have the same structure by #4 can be tested for equivalence
&gt; in linear or nearly linear time.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1.  I regard the meaning of a sign or expression to be:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     a.  its denotation  (= object, referent, bedeutung).
&gt; &gt;     b.  its connotation (= interpretant, sense, sinn).
&gt; &gt;     c.  either of the above.
&gt; &gt;     d.  none of the above.
&gt; &gt;     e.  other (go to essay section).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  I regard a proposition, in use, not mention, to be:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     a.  a sign (= expression, sentence), either token or type,
&gt; &gt;                not excluding the interpretants of other signs.
&gt; &gt;     b.  an object, either abstract or concrete, token or type,
&gt; &gt;                just for example, the denotation of a sentence.
&gt; &gt;     c.  either of the above.
&gt; &gt;     d.  none of the above.
&gt; &gt;     e.  other (go to essay section).
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, we agree on those points.

That was a questionnaire.  I was asking you to pick some options.
Shall I then interpret your response as "1c" and "2c", or have
I misunderstood?  Those are my choices, too, but I take it to
be incumbent on a person who opts for them, just as I see it,
to adumbrate implicitly or to specify explicitly which of
these formally, relationally, and structurally distinct
options he is putting into play at any given moment.
Much confusion will otherwise result.

&gt; &gt; I have gone back to your definitions and read them again,
&gt; &gt; and I am still confused about how I should understand your
&gt; &gt; use of the words "meaning" and "proposition".  Perhaps it
&gt; &gt; was that use of Peirce's statement about propositions,
&gt; &gt; which I still cannot read as referring to anything else
&gt; &gt; but propositional expressions as a class of signs.
&gt; 
&gt; That is exactly what I said: "Peirce's informal statement may
&gt; be formalized by defining a proposition as an equivalence
&gt; class of sentences that can be translated from one to another
&gt; while preserving meaning."   Then I stated four conditions
&gt; for what I would call a "meaning-preserving translation".

Okay, I will try to remember that you talk this way.
The way I see it, however, your translation of what you
describe as "Peirce's informal statement" into formal terms
is a translation that alters significant aspects of its meaning.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; In effect, Montague's equivalence classes correspond to
&gt; a definition of MPT that uses only the first two criteria:
&gt; invertible and proof preserving.  The criteria of vocabulary
&gt; preserving and structure preserving make finer distinctions.
&gt; Furthermore, they can be computed much more efficiently than
&gt; the criterion of proof preserving on arbitrary sentences.
