Dear Frank,

That all sounds pretty sensible to me.

&gt; &gt; Taken together these rules do not cohere, though in 
&gt; isolation each might
&gt; &gt; seem reasonable. For example, the proposed rule eliminating quorum
&gt; &gt; requirements entirely does not cohere with a high seconding 
&gt; requirement of
&gt; &gt; five votes to apply to even technical objections.  (We 
&gt; could in principle
&gt; &gt; have votes in which only four people participated counted 
&gt; as valid, while
&gt; &gt; four people would not suffice to object to the result).
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Lee-
&gt; 
&gt; At first glance, I had some similar thoughts.  However, I 
&gt; realized that all 
&gt; three are truly separate aspects (however, the "seconding" 
&gt; and "objecting" 
&gt; numbers should be the same, see below).
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; On the "quorum" issue ...
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that "quorum" is not a factor in E-mail 
&gt; (correspondence-based) 
&gt; consensus-building because there is no sense of "being 
&gt; present" (everyone is 
&gt; presumed to be continuously present ... yes, some people may 
&gt; be on vacation, 
&gt; but ballots are typically 30 days ... we would presume that a 
&gt; participant 
&gt; must access their E-mail at least once every 30 days).
&gt; 
&gt; In correspondence-based standards committee processes (which 
&gt; is pretty much 
&gt; how many standards committees operated for the 100 years up 
&gt; until the mid to 
&gt; late 1990's), there is some minimum requirement of 
&gt; *responses* to letter 
&gt; ballots (an E-mail ballot is, in effect, a letter ballot).  
&gt; Typically, the 
&gt; requirement is 50% ... this is one of the cases where 
&gt; Abstains count: the 
&gt; number of responses is Yes + No + Abstain.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd recommend that we require a minimum number of responses to E-mail 
&gt; (letter) ballots, say 50%.  We shouldn't call this a "quorum" 
&gt; because the 
&gt; term "quorum" can confuse people in this context.  We should 
&gt; call this 
&gt; something like "minimum number of ballot responses".
&gt; 
&gt; Using a "minimum number of ballot responses" serves the same 
&gt; purpose as a 
&gt; "quorum" in in-person meetings: it ensures that committee 
&gt; decisions were 
&gt; made by a "substantial" number of participants ("subtantial" 
&gt; might be 1/3, 
&gt; 40%, 50%, 2/3, 3/4 ... the choice is a matter of opinion, each with 
&gt; different strengths and weaknesses).  For RR00, a default 
&gt; "quorum" is a 
&gt; majority, i.e., &gt;50%, but organizations may agree upon 
&gt; different numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; On a second (third, fourth, or fifth) ...
&gt; 
&gt; In RROO (Robert's Rules of Order), the purpose of a second is 
&gt; minimize the 
&gt; amount frivolous discussion (in terms of formal committee 
&gt; deliberations ... 
&gt; we can have as much "frivolous" discussion as we like outside 
&gt; the formal 
&gt; deliberation on the E-mail reflector).  Choosing the right 
&gt; level of support 
&gt; (i.e., choosing a number like 2 in RROO, or choosing 5 as Jim 
&gt; suggested) is 
&gt; a matter of opinion.  I really believe that Jim is correct in 
&gt; assessing the 
&gt; large amount of administrative work (which includes all of us 
&gt; volunteers) in 
&gt; formal votes and, possibly, subsequent ballot resolution.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if 5 is the right number, but it sounds 
&gt; reasonable to me.  
&gt; Although a formula can make it more complex, I'd like the 
&gt; number 5 (or 
&gt; whatever it is) to shrink if the number of voting members 
&gt; shrinks.  The 
&gt; minimum should be 2.
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; On an objection to votes by acclimation (as Jim phrased it: 
&gt; "does anyone 
&gt; object to ..." for minor issues from the Chair and 
&gt; consensus-building for 
&gt; the Technical Editor) ...
&gt;  
&gt; I'd like to peel apart several aspects of Jim's suggestions.  
&gt; First, the 
&gt; primary purpose of voting by acclamation is to speed the 
&gt; process when there 
&gt; is overwhelming agreement (see my excerpt of RROO at the end of this 
&gt; E-mail).  In in-person meetings, this can be determined by 
&gt; lots of nodding 
&gt; heads ... harder to determine in E-mail discussion.  I 
&gt; believe three things 
&gt; are necessary to make this work:
&gt; 
&gt;         1.  The Chair needs to get a good sense that there are no 
&gt; objections.  I can't give any hard and fast rules, but it 
&gt; just comes from 
&gt; experience.  Maybe the Chair can give a preliminary message 
&gt; like "I'm not 
&gt; hearing any objections to such and such and I'd like to get a vote by 
&gt; acclamation".  FYI, Paul (who just ran the Chair's election) made a 
&gt; reasonable assumption on voting by acclamation because there 
&gt; was no opposing 
&gt; candidate.  FYI2, SUO members, too, made a reasonable request 
&gt; to have a 
&gt; formal vote (see below).
&gt; 
&gt;         2.  Contentious issues should not be voted on by acclamation.
&gt; 
&gt;         3.  Participants should be reasonable in their 
&gt; objections to votes 
&gt; by acclamation.  In other words, don't just presume grand 
&gt; conspiricies and 
&gt; evil intentions ... this only adds ill will, frustration, and loss of 
&gt; valuable time.  A simple "I object to the vote by 
&gt; acclamation.  I'd rather 
&gt; have a formal vote." is all that is necessary.  This 
&gt; (collabration and 
&gt; consensus-building in *this* group) is a learning experience 
&gt; for all us ... 
&gt; it may take a while for the Chair and the participants to get 
&gt; the right 
&gt; sense of things.  If you have insights on how the Chair might 
&gt; have misread 
&gt; the committee, then send your suggestions to the Chair 
&gt; directly ... no need 
&gt; to tie up E-mail reflector bandwidth.
&gt; 
&gt; The second half of this is consensus-building for the 
&gt; Technical Editor.  The 
&gt; TE can use several strategies for improving the document.  
&gt; However, the most 
&gt; important feature of the TE's work is that (1) he make 
&gt; changes based on 
&gt; direction from the group, (2) he use his judgement to make 
&gt; suggestions, and 
&gt; (3) his work requires approval (e.g., every new formal draft) 
&gt; from the 
&gt; group.  In other words, there are a good number of "controls" 
&gt; over the TE's 
&gt; work.  I wouldn't want to constrain the TE's work to the 
&gt; 5-person rule 
&gt; because even one person's objections might make sense (see 
&gt; the notion of 
&gt; "consensus" at the end of this E-mail).  The role of the TE 
&gt; is to make 
&gt; educated guesses about the consensus of the Working Group ... 
&gt; like the 
&gt; Chair, he may make some mistakes, but please give him some 
&gt; leeway ... we are 
&gt; all trying to do this electronically, so there may be some miscues.
&gt; 
&gt; In conclusion, the 5-person objection rule (or whatever the 
&gt; number) is 
&gt; primarily a tool to help speed the adminstrative and 
&gt; consensus-building 
&gt; aspects of the committee (the Chair) ... not a vehicle to rush things 
&gt; through.  The number for objections should be the same number for 
&gt; "seconding" because an objection causes a formal vote, just 
&gt; like "seconding" 
&gt; does.  As I said above, I don't recommend the 5-person 
&gt; minimum for the TE's 
&gt; work since there are regular, formal votes to approve new drafts.
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; &gt; Is there some e-mail template that has worked elsehwere ("a best
&gt; &gt; practice")  that we can adopt?
&gt; 
&gt; The suggestions above are based on best/existing practices 
&gt; from ISO, IEC, 
&gt; NCITS, and IEEE standards committees.
&gt; 
&gt; These suggestions on "quorum" (actually, participation level) 
&gt; are based on 
&gt; existing formal ballot rules for many standards committees 
&gt; (ISO/IEC, NCITS, 
&gt; IEEE).
&gt; 
&gt; The suggestions on "acclamation" for the Chair are based on 
&gt; RROO in the 
&gt; section on "Voting by General Consent".  Here's an excerpt 
&gt; (from "The New 
&gt; Robert's Rules of Order", Barnes and Noble pocket edition, ISBN 
&gt; 0-88029-972-X, pages 154-155):
&gt; 
&gt;         General Consent.  When the formality of motions and 
&gt; voting can be 
&gt; avoided in routine business and on questions of little 
&gt; importance, business 
&gt; can be handled with greater efficiency, the chair assuming general 
&gt; (unanimous) consent until someone objects.  General consent does not 
&gt; necessarily mean that every member is in facvor of the 
&gt; motion, but, knowing 
&gt; it is useless to oppose it or even to discuss it, the 
&gt; opposition simply 
&gt; acquiesces in the formality.  Thus, in the case of approving 
&gt; the minutes, 
&gt; the chair asks if there are any corrections.  If one is 
&gt; suggested, it is 
&gt; made.  When no correction is suggested, the chair says, 
&gt; "There being no 
&gt; corrections [or no further corrections] the minutes stand 
&gt; approved".  While 
&gt; routine and minor matters can be rapidly diposed of in this 
&gt; way, any time an 
&gt; objection is made promptly, the chair ignores what has been 
&gt; done even if he 
&gt; has announced the result, and requires a regular vote.
&gt; 
&gt; The suggestions on the TE's (using his judgement to assess 
&gt; objections, seek 
&gt; compromises, and build consensus) are the "common sense" one 
&gt; learns in that 
&gt; role ... as mentioned above, there are "controls" from the 
&gt; working group 
&gt; that make sure the WG gets what it wants ... the TE is an informed 
&gt; participant that helps with the editing tasks.  In ISO/IEC 
&gt; committees, as 
&gt; convener (a position similar to a Chair), one learns the 
&gt; "consensus" is the 
&gt; absence of sustained, substanial opposition ... that doesn't 
&gt; mean unanimous 
&gt; ... it's a judgement call.  The TE's need to have a sense of 
&gt; "consensus" to 
&gt; direct their work.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this helps.
