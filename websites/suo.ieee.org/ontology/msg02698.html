Bernard,

Thanks for your comments. I think that we are approaching this idea from
different perspectives, and have in mind different methods -- this is ok,
perhaps our approaches will converge on something, or perhaps they will
produce different results.

The approach that I would like to investigate, toward building a "standard
kernel ontology", would be a formal approach, using methods like those being
used for other formal ontology approaches in this forum, e.g. merged
ontology, IFF, etc. The difference, if any, would be one of focus on a core
ontology, rather than an upper ontology, as I described in my original
proposal for this approach, reprinted below.

The approach that you are describing seems quite different, though it could
be helpful, as I wrote before:

[PJ]
&gt; I do think that work on topic maps could be useful in this approach, in at
&gt; least two ways: 1) the methods used to construct topic maps could be
&gt; helpful
&gt; in identifying candidates for ontological primitives, and for identifying
&gt; how the ontology kernel could be extended to new concepts and domains; 2)
&gt; the topic map approach could be useful for visualization of the ontology
&gt; kernel and its extensions.

Here are some more comments -- You wrote:

[BV]
&gt; The kernel ontology I envision is like a central
&gt; conceptual attractor, which could be extracted from a large collaborative
&gt; topic map of general concepts, through clustering procedures.
&gt; As I proposed
&gt; in a previous message, we have right now the tools to conduct such an
&gt; experiment: both collaborative on-line software to build the
&gt; semantic graph
&gt; data base, and graph clustering algorithms. These algorithms are based on
&gt; the density of graph incidence. In short, you feed the base with thousands
&gt; of topics and local associations (n-ar relationships), without any
&gt; predefined global plan, classification nor hierarchy, and even with
&gt; contradictory or at least divergent views of the world. The clustering
&gt; algorithms will construct a "zoom-out" reduction of the graph,
&gt; following the
&gt; principle that the most connected nodes are the most important ones.

I see this as producing a topic map, but not a formal ontology -- i.e. this
does not produce definitions for concepts, axioms, etc. It leverages local
associations that must be defined in advance. Such associations might be
derived from definitions, axioms, etc., but such associations would not in
themselves necessarily be sufficient for deriving definitions, axioms, etc.

&gt; I am very curious to see if the result will make sense or would
&gt; turn out to
&gt; be some other messy representation model.

I think it would probably make sense as a topic map, but it would not
produce a formal ontology, i.e. it would not produce a formal representation
of an ontology.

[PJ]
&gt; &gt; I listed a few examples of potential conceptual / ontological / semantic
&gt; &gt; primitives. I think these are probably a good core set to start
&gt; &gt; with, but I
&gt; &gt; also think that further discussion will produce refinements and
&gt; &gt; additional candidates.

[BV]
&gt; As a matter of fact, some of the primitives you propose are
&gt; already used in
&gt; the quoted project as "middle" ontology terms, that is to define
&gt; role types
&gt; in associations of individuals. For example : event, tool,
&gt; context ...

They may be role types for associations in some topic maps, but for this
approach they would be central concepts, used to define other concepts.

[BV]
&gt; This
&gt; completely bottom-up approach could meet in the same graph structure the
&gt; top-down approach of formalists. That is the challenge. What I suggest is
&gt; not to discuss the validity or centrality of the concepts you push, but to
&gt; implement them and begin to build associations around them and other
&gt; proposed "primitives".

I think that people pursuing the formal approach will need to have
discussions about validity and centrality, and will need to develop axioms,
definitions, etc. From such formal statements you might be able to develop
associations that could be used in a topic map approach.

[BV]
&gt; I suppose you will have some ideas how to
&gt; connect the
&gt; core concepts you propose together and with other ones. I look forward for
&gt; you now to come and play in that sandbox!

I do have some ideas but I want to play in a different sandbox, if others
want to play in that sandbox. Maybe we can throw some sand into your
sandbox! :-)

&gt; Of course, as David Whitten points out elsewhere, this would not make for
&gt; inference rules. Not yet. But maybe along the road we'll find
&gt; paths towards that also.

In the formal ontology sandbox, inference rules will be directly supported.

Cheers,

Phil Jackson

"If we were to find that all the grains of sand on a certain beach separated
themselves into two or more sharply discrete classes, as spherical and
cubical ones, there would be something to be explained, but that they are of
various sizes and shapes, of no definable character, can only be referred to
the general manifoldness of nature. Indeterminacy, then, or pure firstness,
and hæcceity, or pure secondness, are facts not calling for and not capable
of explanation. Indeterminacy affords us nothing to ask a question about;
hæcceity is the ultima ratio, the brutal fact that will not be questioned.
But every fact of a general or orderly nature calls for an explanation; and
logic forbids us to assume in regard to any given fact of that sort that it
is of its own nature absolutely inexplicable. This is what Kant calls a
regulative principle, that is to say, an intellectual hope." - CSP, CP1:405

&gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: standard-upper-ontology@ieee.org
&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: RE: SUO: Re: Focus and Volume
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree the following is well worth trying, particularly if combined
&gt; &gt; &gt; with John Sowa's recent idea of focussing on differences.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pat
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Another point of view, for people's consideration, could be the
&gt; &gt; &gt; following:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- Our ultimate goal is to have a "standard ontology", for supporting
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;applications that originally motivated the formation of SUO as a
&gt; working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;group.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- Toward that end, our goal should be to develop a "standard kernel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ontology", and we shouldn't worry about whether it is upper,
&gt; &gt; &gt; middle, lower,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;etc. One might call it a "foundation ontology", or "core ontology".
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;- Our method in developing this standard kernel ontology should
&gt; &gt; &gt; be to seek a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;standard set of "ontological/conceptual primitives", using which
&gt; &gt; &gt; all other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;concepts in an ontology can be defined via some standard "concept
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;specification language" -- this language might be KIF or we
&gt; &gt; &gt; might decide it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;should be something else, perhaps to be developed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Examples of concepts we might want to use and axiomatize as
&gt; conceptual
&gt; /
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;semantic primitives might include:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Entity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Agent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Context
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Situation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;State
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Space
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Matter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Structure
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Event
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Action
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Process
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Method
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Tool
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Theory
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Sign
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Referent
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Language
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Taking this approach shifts our focus from thinking in terms of
&gt; &gt; &gt; a top-down
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ontological hierachy, in which relations between concepts may be
&gt; limited,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;toward thinking in terms of how concepts can be defined in terms of
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;concepts, and finding a kernel of primitive concepts and definitional
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;mechanisms that appear to be sufficient for defining all
&gt; &gt; &gt; concepts one might
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;need in a complete ontology.
