Jon, 

Thank you for your considered reply to my question.  I'm afraid that I'm
still a bit perplexed, see below.

best,

Mike Pool

&gt;Item 1.  Systematic Errors In Ontology
&gt;
&gt;I have begun an examination of sytematic errors in ontology.
&gt;Here is the outline that I have formulated up to this point:
&gt;
&gt;Ontology Of Systematic Errors Affecting Ontological Projects.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Insufficient Reality Testing.
&gt;
&gt;1.1.  Lack of respect for the complexity
&gt;      of the phenomenon or the problem
&gt;      that one is addressing.
&gt;
&gt;1.1.1.  Procrustean Monadomania.
&gt;        Trying to force relational realities
&gt;        into non-relative monadic categories.
&gt;
&gt;1.1.1.1.  Absolutism.
&gt;1.1.1.2.  Essentialism.
&gt;1.1.1.3.  Invariantism.
&gt;1.1.1.4.  Objectivism.
&gt;1.1.1.5.  Universalism.
&gt;
&gt;When I refer to a point of view as an &quot;ism&quot;,
&gt;I do not mean merely that it emphasizes the
&gt;importance of the declared aspect of things,
&gt;but that it stresses it to the exclusion of
&gt;of the complementary dimension of existence.
&gt;
&gt;For example, I have no fixed position myself with regard to whether
&gt;absolutes, essences, invariants, objectivities, or univerals exist.
&gt;I think it is very likely that they do, I just do not know of any
&gt;for sure, and most of those that I have seen put forward do not
&gt;stand up under examination.  Aside from all that, it appears
&gt;to me that such things become evident only toward the end
&gt;of an inquiry, not at the beginning, and so I think that
&gt;we mostly discover them à posteriori, rather than being
&gt;able to claim them à priori.  From this point of view,
&gt;then, we ought to treat all such categories and all
&gt;such categorical claims as theoretical hypotheses,
&gt;and yes, that includes this one, too.
&gt;
&gt;Item 2.  Content, Form, Function  
&gt;
&gt;JA: I meant to get back to these observations that
&gt;    John Sowa made, because I think that they are
&gt;    critically important to the proper conception
&gt;    of our task:
&gt;
&gt;JS: This raises the question of what we can standardize if
&gt;    we are not standardizing content.  The answer is form:
&gt;    we should be focusing on formal ways of organizing all
&gt;    the ontological resources that are available, including
&gt;    SUMO, OpenCyc, IMPS, WordNet, EDR, etc.
&gt;
&gt;JS: IFF is an effort in that direction, but it has not been tested on
&gt;    actual content and applications.  Having at least two rich content
&gt;    ontologies, such as OpenCyc and SUMO, should bring to the fore the
&gt;    question of how they can be mixed, matched, and used together.
&gt;
&gt;JS: I would like to open up all the other sources
&gt;    of content for consideration in this mélange.
&gt;
&gt;JA: I would add these observations.
&gt;
&gt;JA: Drawing the distinction between form and content is important
&gt;    because it is the line between what is our business and what
&gt;    is not our business.  We simply have no business trying to
&gt;    redo the work of content experts and domain specialists.
&gt;
&gt;MP: I would appreciate it if you (Jon) and/or John Sowa could flesh out
&gt;    this alleged content-form distinction a little bit;  I'm afraid that
&gt;    I don't find the word processor analogy sufficiently helpful.
&gt;

&gt;Mike,
&gt;
&gt;I will try to flesh out the way that I see the issues here,
&gt;since I don't yet know how well I got what John was saying.
&gt;I have to shift over to the Ontology list, but we can save
&gt;anything that develops, worth reporting out, for tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt;I have been reflecting on my experiences with &quot;content experts&quot; in a wide
variety
&gt;of fields, from times when I used to do all sorts of comp/dat/stats work
in many
&gt;different academic, applied, education, and research settings, and I am
trying
&gt;to focus on thinking about what it was exactly that those folks really
needed,
&gt;and what they clearly did not need, and along with my ruminating about that,
&gt;I am trying to diagnose the gaps between the varieties of &quot;solutions&quot; that
&gt;I learned at school and the actual problems that anybody had in practice.
&gt;
&gt;The Concept Processor ~~ Word Processor ~~ Statistical Package metaphor is
&gt;one that I have always used as a way of drawing a line between the &quot;content&quot;
&gt;and the &quot;architecture&quot; of formats and functions that make up the system that
&gt;one uses to work with this content.  The taxonomies that &quot;contented&quot; users or
&gt;domain experts already have on hand, or ever plan to fiddle with, are like
the
&gt;documents that we use a WP to write or the data sets that we use a SP to
analyze.
&gt;
&gt;The basic point is that end users do not need us to create the domain
ontologies
&gt;for them -- they will treat that as so much dumb clip-art -- since they
take quite
&gt;a bit of fussy and even indignant pride in being the ones to do that for
themselves.
&gt;The rule here is not &quot;keep it short and simple&quot; (KISAS) but &quot;knowing your
stuff&quot; (KYS).

&gt;And I can tell you that, when it comes to topic areas that I myself have
spent 2 or 3
&gt;decades studying, like graph theory or semiotics, the efforts of
ontological novices
&gt;to dictate axioms is just bound to be somewhere between infuriating and
ridiculous.
&gt;And as far as some of the vacuous concepts that we have seen being bandied
about
&gt;the forum here, like &quot;abstract&quot;, &quot;entity&quot;, &quot;physical&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, well, ...
&gt;
&gt;So if we are going to have any use at all here, it had better be something
else.
&gt;One of the things that frequently comes to my mind in this connection is
the task
&gt;of finding &quot;primitives more primitive than the primitives in previous
prehensions&quot;.
&gt;These &quot;underwhelming primitives&quot; (UP's) would be called &quot;upper predicates&quot;
by some,
&gt;but to my way of thinking one always finds them by digging deeper, into
the grounds
&gt;of assumed solidity that most people are presently taking far too much for
granted.
&gt;But this is a very difficult analytic, critical, reflective task, one that
requires
&gt;very different kinds of logical utilities than most people would have in
mind under
&gt;the run of the mill variety of theorem provers running about the logical
farm today.
&gt;
&gt;MP: To my mind there's not much in an ontology that is strictly form.
&gt;
&gt;I am guessing that this view can only arise from not
&gt;having seen a sufficient number of formal variations.
&gt;
Well since you won't tell me what you mean by 'form' I don't know whether
this is correct or not.  Give me an example of a formal variation, a formal
variation of what?  You were suggesting that the SUO provide no content,
only form.  I had no idea what this amounted to and was trying my own
intuitions about the meaning of 'form' in this context.   I thought that by
'form' you might mean concepts whose denoting terms are often used as the
syntactic building blocks for formal represesentation, e.g., logical
connectors plus equality, membership and subset relations,  but your
perplexity at my suggestion below suggests that this isn't what you meant.
Instead you mean something like &quot;architecture of form and function&quot; and the
formats available for representing knowledge.  I afraid that I still don't
know what this means.   

Let me try out another possibility.  Are you asking for an interface for
ontology construction and browsing?  That's a reasonable suggestion,
although I'd claim that such a gui requires some upper ontology content to
make it work.  If I was a domain expert and wanted to describe some process
in auto mechanics this would be very difficult to do if the system had no
notion of &quot;process&quot; or &quot;instrument&quot;, etc.  That aside, suggesting that the
SUO focus on gui design or construction seems unreasonable.  This isn't
something that one designs and constructs in an IEEE standards group, is
it?   Similarly (?) designing an effective word processor likely requires
little input from a standards group.


&gt;MP: I would assume that logical operators and equality could
&gt;    be safely included and without too much controversy, ...
&gt;

&gt;I bite my tongue ...
&gt;
&gt;MP: except from the set theory purists, we could probably include
&gt;    notions of membership and subset on the form side.  We might
&gt;    also include the most general relationship categories, e.g.,
&gt;    BinaryPredicate, BinaryFunction, and the vocabulary and rules
&gt;    for articulating constraints on the arguments or domain and
&gt;    range of a relation, but I think most would contend that
&gt;    we've already moved into content here.
&gt;
&gt;I am experiencing a serious disconnect here.
&gt;Let me see if I can figure it out later on.
&gt;
&gt;MP: Does your position (and/or John Sowa's) on the SUO simply amount to a
claim
&gt;    that the IEEE ontology standardization effort should cover only the
logical
&gt;    operators, equality and basic notions of set theory?  If so, I'll go one
&gt;    further.   These notions aren't in need of standardization, so if you're
&gt;    correct that we should stay away from content I would contend that we
&gt;    should just pack in the whole thing.
&gt;
&gt;Okay, by &quot;form&quot; I mean things like &quot;architecture of form and function&quot;,
&gt;that is, the formats that are made available for representing knowledge
&gt;and the functions that we can apply to the expressed models or theories.
&gt;In the analogy, like &quot;style sheets&quot; and buttons on the various tool bars.
&gt;There is a vast array of conceivable themes and variations in these things
&gt;that are hardly yet dreamt of in Horatio's contemporary onto/logical schemes.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know if that's making more or less sense.
&gt;
&gt;Jon
&gt;
&gt;MP: I feel like my question is a bit naive but I really don't know what
&gt;    the &quot;concentrate on form&quot; proposal amounts to.  Perhaps this has been
&gt;    addressed in one of John Sowa's emails or papers.  If so, please point
&gt;    me there and I apologize for missing it on the first go round.
&gt;
&gt;MP: Maybe your answer(s) to this will help me to understand what
&gt;    Jon means by &quot;generic functions of conceptual work&quot; below.
&gt;
&gt;JA: To invoke the analogy between &quot;concept processors&quot; and word processors,
&gt;    our job is analogous to writing the specifications for a word processor,
&gt;    our is not the business of supplying ready-made term papers to students.
&gt;
&gt;JA: Most of the domain knowledge that actually exists in the world is not yet
&gt;    in the above short list of &quot;ontological resources&quot; and much of the
content
&gt;    that does reside in some of these sources would be just plain
ridiculous to
&gt;    any specialists actually working in the supposedly covered domains.
&gt;
&gt;JA: So I think that the list of &quot;other sources&quot; and the overall mix of
&gt;    ingredients in this mélange would need to be widened considerably
&gt;    beyond what's currently contained in these putative resources.
&gt;
&gt;JA: To advert a potential misunderstanding that I can already see coming
&gt;    down the road, I am decidedly not saying that there is nothing left
&gt;    for us &quot;meta, generic, abstract, philosophical&quot; folks to do once the
&gt;    lion's share of content and domain cutlets have been carved off the
&gt;    corpus of the world's knowledge beast.  What is left is precisely
&gt;    the form, and I would add the function, and those are the aspects
&gt;    of knowledge evolution that we should be working to facilitate.

&gt;
&gt;JA: Again the analogy with word processors;
&gt;    the real design and spec questions are:
&gt;
&gt;JA: 1.  What are the generic forms of conceptual content
&gt;        that concept users need to be supported in using?
&gt;
&gt;JA: 2.  What are the generic functions of conceptual work?
&gt;        Which functions can be given supporting utilities?
&gt;
&gt;JA: I think that those are the sorts of services that
&gt;    a standard ontology utility ought to be providing.
