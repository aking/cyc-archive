&gt;Matthew, Adam, et al.,
&gt;
&gt;In response to a recent posting by Matthew (in response to Adam) on the
&gt;SUO list, I am posting this to ONT instead, but feel free to kick
&gt;it back up to SUO if you think it appropriate.
&gt;
&gt;(Note, I see this just crossed John's post to the SUO list...)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Matthew says:
&gt;
&gt;&lt;little snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: An ontology is really overkill for this. Though I should perhaps make
&gt; &gt; clear some distinctions I use related to terms like ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Taxonomy, a dictionary of standard terms and their natural language
&gt; &gt;    definitions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Thesaurus, a taxonomy with subtype/supertype relations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Data Model, a structure of types and relations against which instances
&gt; &gt;    of the types and relations can be stored. Definitions of the types and
&gt; &gt;    relations are in natural language. Some constraints are defined, usually
&gt; &gt;    in terms of the cardinality of relationships.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - Ontology, types, relations, and possibly instances of those together
&gt; &gt;    with axioms, usually in First Order Logic, that define the rules that
&gt; &gt;    apply to members of the types and relations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Data Models are what are usually developed/used to design a database. The
&gt; &gt; axioms of an ontology are generally of little use/relevance either in the
&gt; &gt; design of the database, or in the population of it by instances.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So in general my question for this sort of case would be: Why would you
&gt; &gt; develop an ontology (more work) when a data model will do?
&gt;
&gt;&lt;big snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;1. Would people on this list agree with Matthew's distinctions between
&gt;data models and ontologies?
&gt;
&gt;On the one hand, it does seem that the key distinction is the use of
&gt;axioms, which in turn allow for inferences above and beyond what might
&gt;be stored in a database (based on a data model). On the other hand, one
&gt;often encounters, in doing  data modeling, certain constraints, which
&gt;are, in effect, &quot;rules that apply to members of the types and
&gt;relations.&quot;  Is there a sharp  distinction between the kinds of rules
&gt;used to define constraints in data models and the kinds of rules defined
&gt;via axioms in ontologies?
&gt;
&gt;2. And what is the role of logic in defining these rules (for data models
&gt;and for ontologies)? I ask the question broadly, but one particular issue
&gt;I am interested in is the use of implications (if-then statements) to
&gt;express these rules. For the database case especially, such rules seem
&gt;to be expressed as implications. Similarly, I think, for the ontology
&gt;case.  But typically the logic used in an ontology goes much further, or
&gt;so it seems to me. For instance, won't any logic used to represent
&gt;an ontology also have pegged to it inference rules, a proof theory,
&gt;and a semantics?  Do all these logical extras exist also in, say, a
&gt;relational data model, and is the reason they are not so apparent is
&gt;that the relevant subset of first-order logic is in essence hard-wired
&gt;and implicit in the relational model?
&gt;
&gt;Could someone elaborate on the different ways in which logic is used to
&gt;define the rules both in data models and ontologies, perhaps especially
&gt;focusing on the common logical flavor of if-then rules in both cases?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;3. Related to the second point above, as well as to the SUO's effort in
&gt;creating an ontology, can one express the kind of ontology we are after
&gt;_without_ using logic?  That is, for the kind of computer-crunchable
&gt;ontology that the SUO effort seeks to create, could it exist without
&gt;logic? I suspect that it could, but that such an ontology would be an
&gt;impoverished one.
&gt;
&gt;Two more, if I may.
&gt;
&gt;4. Related to the third point, is a logic-based, machine-processable
&gt;representation of an ontology particularly apt for our purposes, for
&gt;the following reasons?
&gt;
&gt;One could say that ontology is concerned with &quot;what is,&quot; the things that 
&gt;exist and the relations among
&gt;those things. Logic (plus) model theory is an appropriate way to express
&gt;the notions of an ontology, because the syntax of logic can represent
&gt;things that are, and the model theory of a logic allows us to say &quot;what
&gt;is so.&quot;  Does this make any sense?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;5. Finally, related to the points three and four above, and to some recent
&gt;discussion on the SUO list about the language for the SUO (which I think
&gt;have been raised before -- and settled????), I have a question for
&gt;Adam (and John and Chris and whoever else cares to chime in).
&gt;
&gt;Simply put, &quot;Where is the semantics of SUMO?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Don't clobber me; I think I may have an inkling of the answer, but I need
&gt;some help to make things clearer to me.  My inkling is: &quot;Well, the semantics
&gt;of SUMO is given, essentially, via the semantics of KIF (or the version
&gt;that SUMO uses).&quot;

That's correct.


&gt;The semantics of KIF (to be superseded by the semantics of CL) -- well,
&gt;there is where I have a question.  On the one hand, there is a model theory
&gt;for KIF at <A  HREF="http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/semantics.tex">http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/semantics.tex</A>
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, accordinig to the draft standard at
&gt;<A  HREF="http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/dpans.html">http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/dpans.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The language has declarative semantics. It is possible to understand the
&gt;meaning of expressions in the language without appeal to an interpreter
&gt;for manipulating those expressions.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I'm guessing that KIF's semantics is defined by the model theory document,
&gt;but how to account for the above mention of a &quot;declarative semantics&quot;?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Jim
