&gt; Mike, 
&gt; 	.	The MAIN problem with your argument is that not meeting
&gt; doesn't mean no communication. Another is that the aim isn't to "feed" the
&gt; participants, but to produce something of value. 

Forgetting the analogy for the moment, the point I'm trying to make is:

Some F2F contact is better than none, even if not everyone can have the same
amount.  This is precisely because F2F interaction for some things is MUCH
better than email, and is thus likely to produce something of HIGHER VALUE.
Lets compare the likely quality of the document with:
1. no f2f at all
2. some f2f, but not equal amount for everyone. 
   The worst case may be that there is a lot of f2f by a small few, and none by
   the majority.

If there is a clear and compelling argument that says the overal quality of the
document will be WORSE in case 2, will someone please articulate it?  To me the
opposite seems much more likely.

One might argue that even if the quality was worse, it would be better because
it was more fair. If it WAS more fair, then this is a matter of opinion. But I
don't buy the unfairness argument.

The people who had no f2f have every opportunity to evaluate the results of
f2f-assisted input. It seems to me a great BOON to have small groups go away
and settle things among themselves, and them present the results back to the
group.  It is more efficient.

Mike

Mike, 
	.	The MAIN problem with your argument is that not meeting
doesn't mean no communication. Another is that the aim isn't to "feed" the
participants, but to produce something of value. 

	.	To me, your approach conjures up images half complete
aircraft because only half the subcontractors could move their plants to the
location of the main factory. 

	.	On the other hand, my concern with the sort of meeting
proposed is likely to result in a geographically based bias to any decisions
that arise. For example, not all of us reside in, or represent, the USA. 

	.	I seem to recall that the I in IEEE stands for
International!?

&gt;         .               Sounds great, but would only serve to exclude
those
who would not be accorded funding for such trips. I suggest that would
reduce the equity and balance of the SUO development process further. It
might be only a short distance for some, but it's half a world away for
others
----

This reasoning seems a bit flawed, however well-meaning. 
It is clearly a good thing to have f2f meetings.  Shall we
rule them out becuase not everyone can participate?

Suppose you had 50 starving people, and only enough food to feed SOME of
them.
Would you deny ALL of them food because it was unfair to the ones who got
none?

The analogy may be bad in any number of ways, but I hope it makes the
desired
point: Some is better than none, even if not everyone can have the same
amount.

Mike
