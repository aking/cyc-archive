&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps.  But propositional logic may be so simplified that
&gt; &gt; &gt; some of the most crucial distinctions, such as fixing the
&gt; &gt; &gt; reference to particular entities in the world, may not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; apparent.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And also certain illusions, like the idea that we can
&gt; &gt; automatically refine a "particular" to an "individual",
&gt; &gt; do not there so easily become so insidiously entrenched.
&gt; 
&gt; That is indeed a very serious illusion that confused Bertie R.,
&gt; which led to his ill-fated infatuation with logical atomism,
&gt; which infected poor old Ludwig W. to the point where he needed
&gt; a quick transfusion via Frank R. of Peirce's semiotics.
&gt; 
&gt; However, that does not mean that FOL is bad.
&gt; Peirce invented it, after all.

Yes, but he would not have foisted it on the world
if had not already formulated the antidotes first,
namely second- &amp; possibly third-intentional logic.
But the world bought the poison cause it tasted
sweeter and eschewed the antidote for its salt.

&gt; &gt; &gt; In Polya's little book, _How to Solve It_, one suggestion is
&gt; &gt; &gt; to look at a simplified special case.  But another suggestion
&gt; &gt; &gt; is to look at a more general case.  Each approach highlights
&gt; &gt; &gt; different aspects of a problem, and they complement each other.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; B is more general than R.  It is encumbered by fewer axioms.

Also, you know perfectly well that the only reason that
you can get away with this seemingly paradoxical gambit
of making it lighter by taking on a bigger game is that
you induce the brute beast to work for you in the chain
of an inductive hypothesis.  You have to be lion-taming
in a very special sort of zoo to get away with that one.

&gt; One thing that I like very much about Peirce's axioms for EGs
&gt; is that they apply equally well to propositional and predicate
&gt; calculus -- no need for special-purpose axioms for FOL.  That
&gt; is a generalization that is unobservable if you don't study FOL.

From the very beginning of my work on building the ultimate theorem prover,
I found that I simply had to watch my P's &amp; Q's &amp; R's very carefully, all
the better to tease apart Propositional, Quantificational, &amp; Relational
aspects of the problem.  Otherwise, like many I have seen that are
ostensibly supposed to be so powerful, they spend half their time
bogged down at the P level, constantly rediscovering the wheels
of DeMorgans's like it was the first time every time.  And
I have my own way of approaching the Q level, a way that
gets you all "generalized quantifiers" in one fool swap,
but I still have to get the peanut shells nailed down
before I dare tread on that arena.

&gt; &gt; This is a little bit like saying that folks with weak
&gt; &gt; immune systems are better at detecting health threats,
&gt; &gt; or that canaries are better at detecting toxic gases.
&gt; 
&gt; Not at all!  Computers are much more methodical than any human being
&gt; could ever be.  When they apply a given grammar to a given sentence,
&gt; they exhaustively seek out every possible application of the rules.

And that is just the sort of combinatorial gas
that dooms poor Tweety to death with a whimper --
or else we spelunkers will go out with a Boom!

Yes, you Geeks, that's Boom Factorial =
(Boom)(Boom-1)(Boom-2) ... (3)(2)(1).

&gt; And they are able to enumerate every possible parse and check whether
&gt; there are any possible ambiguities.  Checking for ambiguities is an
&gt; ideal application for computers.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; But if an unresolvable ambiguity does occur, a computer
&gt; &gt; &gt; system can just put up a menu and ask "Which do you mean?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You mean like this one:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Questionnaire:  "Which do you mean?"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  I regard the meaning of a sign or expression to be:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     a.  its denotation  (= object, referent, bedeutung).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     b.  its connotation (= interpretant, sense, sinn).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     c.  either of the above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     d.  none of the above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     e.  other (go to essay section).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  I regard a proposition, in use, not mention, to be:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     a.  a sign (= expression, sentence), either token or type,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                not excluding the interpretants of other signs.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     b.  an object, either abstract or concrete, token or type,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                just for example, the denotation of a sentence.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     c.  either of the above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     d.  none of the above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     e.  other (go to essay section).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am afraid that the problem is rather with getting any human being
&gt; &gt; to pick just one entre from such menu -- so far in the SUO group,
&gt; &gt; I have never seen it happen, nor have I been able yet to get
&gt; &gt; a straight answer from anybody here, and doesn't it always
&gt; &gt; seem to go that the people who affect being fussy about
&gt; &gt; ambiguities are the pickiest eaters in this regard,
&gt; &gt; stubbornly maintaining their own excesses and
&gt; &gt; vacillations while hawking their low-fat
&gt; &gt; diets to others?
&gt; 
&gt; I think that is a very badly designed questionnaire.  I would
&gt; never attempt to answer it myself, without asking the person
&gt; who designed it exactly what he or she might mean by almost
&gt; every term in it.

Yes, that's one answer.  It is, after all, my questionnaire, my design,
just one particular instrument that was constructed on the basis of the
theoretical principles that make some sense to me.  Anybody is entitled
to try and deconstruct its conceptual confounds and its cultural biases.
You would think that people interested in the project of disambiguation
would feel impelled at least to take these questions seriously, and the
fact that they never do just goes to convince me that they already know,
in their heart of ambivalved hearts, that this project is really futile.

&gt; Following is a better example:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Input sentence:
&gt; 
&gt;     "I put the ball on the table, but because it was not
&gt;     level, it rolled off."
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Computer response:
&gt; 
&gt;     What was not level?
&gt; 
&gt;      a) the ball
&gt; 
&gt;      b) the table
&gt; 
&gt;     What rolled off?
&gt; 
&gt;      a) the ball
&gt; 
&gt;      b) the table
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line:  Never expect anyone to answer questions about
&gt; your own pet theory, but you can expect them to answer
&gt; a specific question about an ambiguous reference in the
&gt; sentences they produce on their own initiative.
&gt; 
&gt; John Sowa

But I am not the one who is saying that ambiguity can be eliminated.
I am merely trying to detail its structures in the few places I can.
If you are saying that you don't understand the questionaire, that
you share none of the nomenclature that went into it, then fine.
At least that would help me to explain some things.
