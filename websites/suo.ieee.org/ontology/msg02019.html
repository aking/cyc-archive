    <TD width=220>Individuals are defined <I>a priori</I>. Thus, comparison of 
      systems is observer-independent (extensionality principle). For example, 2

      <H2>2. Two kinds of systems: internal and external</H2><B>Internal

      is an integrated whole that can be partitioned in several ways and 
      represented as a set of components connected by relations. Each 
      representation is a structure (or archetype) of the system. Schreider also 
      believed that besides archetypes-representations there is a unique 
      archetype-essence.<A 
      href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment2"><SUP>2)</SUP></A>
      <P><U>Examples:</U> a living organism, ecosystem, solar system, atom, 
      galaxy.<BR><B>External system</B> is a class of objects that have the same 
      archetype-essence.
      <P><U>Examples:</U> biological taxons: species, orders, types; chemical 
      elements (oxygen, nitrogen).
      <P>Both kinds of systems are characterized by harmony that may be 
      manifested in a symmetry, rhythm, or style. Both systems are not sets but 
      can be represented by sets. Internal systems may have fuzzy components; 
      some objects may correspond to an archetype of an external system only 
      partially. A representation of a system is a model, and there are 
      relationships (morphisms) among various representations of the same 
system.
      <P>
      <H2>3. Complex systems and Control</H2>Complex systems must have a large 
      number of components, but the large number of components does not mean 
      that the systems is complex. A complex system should also have high 
      organization. High organization can be recognized by multiple hierarchical 
      levels, efficient functions, and ability to learn.
      <P>In <U>simple systems</U>, information is processed at a syntax 
      level.<BR>In <U>complex systems</U>, information is processed at the level 
      of semantics and pragmatics.
      <P>Simple systems may include complex systems as components. For example, 
      a military unit is simple system because it interprets commands literally, 
      but each person is a complex system.
      <P>An example of syntactic control is developing a hierarchy of goals from 
      the highest-level goal. Semantic control required developing a system of 
      common values rather than goals. In syntactic control, a sub-system does 
      not care about higher-level goals. Semantic system of control has a fuzzy 
      hierarchical structure because elements of one level may also represent 
      higher-level values.
      <P>
      <H2>4. Models and Theories</H2>Model is an abstract system that represents 
      some aspect of a real system. The same system may have different 
      representations (models).
      <P>A <U>model</U> is a set of elements, <I>S</I>, with some relations, 
      {<I>R</I><SUB>i</SUB>}, defined on this set. All relations are named using 
      vocabulary <I>N</I>. Models are <U>equivalent</U> if their relations are 
      named using the same vocabulary <I>N</I>, and there is an isomorphism 
      (reversible function) between their sets that conserves all their 
      relations.
      <P>A theory is a formal language that specifies the characteristics of 
      relationships. For example, the group theory has 2 relations: a binary 
      operation: <I>a</I> + <I>b</I> = <I>c</I>, and a special unity element 
      <I>I</I>. These relationships are characterized by 5 axioms:
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>For any elements <I>a</I>, <I>b</I> there is an element <I>c</I> so 
        that: <I>a</I> +<I> b</I> = <I>c</I> 
        <LI>For any elements <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>: <I>a</I> + <I>b</I> = <I>b</I> 
        + <I>a</I> 
        <LI>For any elements <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>c</I>: (<I>a</I> +<I> b</I>) 
        + <I>c</I> = <I>a</I> + (<I>b</I> + <I>c</I>) 
        <LI>For any element <I>a</I>: <I>a</I> + <I>I</I> = <I>a</I> 
        <LI>For any element <I>a</I>, there is an element <I>b</I> so that: 
        <I>a</I> + <I>b</I> = <I>I</I> </LI></OL>Many interesting corollaries 
      follow from these axioms. For example, we can prove that the unity element 
      is always unique. A theory has no set of elements; it describes 
      relationships among elements without referring to specific elements. This 
      is the major distinction between a theory and a model which has a set.<A 
      href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment3"><SUP>3)</SUP></A>
      <P>A model, <I>M</I>, satisfies theory <I>T</I> if they correspond to the 
      same set of names for relations, <I>N</I>, and each axiom of <I>T</I> is 
      true in model <I>M</I>. For example, a set of integer numbers with the sum 
      operation and zero as a unity element satisfies the theory of groups.<A 
      href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment4"><SUP>4)</SUP></A>
      <P>The most interesting thing is that in many cases we can describe all 
      possible varieties of models that correspond to a specific theory. The 
      number of non-equivalent models that correspond to the theory may be 
      limited. In this case we get a natural class of models that correspond to 
      some theory. For example there is a limited number of continuous 
      topological spaces of a given dimension.
      <P>Theories can be viewed as platonic ideas that have no substance (no 
      material set). They have meaning only within a particular language 
      practice. For example, <A 
      href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/spreer/Lem.html">Stanislaw Lem</A> 
      wrote in "Star diaries of Ion Tichy" about some planet on which 
      inhabitants used an object called "sepoulka". Ion Tichy tried to talk to 
      several creatures on this planet trying to understand what is "sepoulka" 
      but did not succeed because he had no chance even to see how this object 
      looks like. What he got from answers was a formal theory without reference 
      to a specific set.
      <P>Real objects also can be viewed as models of some formal theory.<A 
      href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment5"><SUP>5)</SUP></A> 
      For example, the solar system is a model of the theory of gravity. A 
      computer model of a solar system is a model of the same theory. But the 
      ontological status of these models is different because they are embodied 
      in different sets. But a model is just one representation of the system 
      among many other possible representations because formal descriptions of 
      systems are always incomplete.
      <P>A theory <I>T</I> is called consistent with the class of models 
      <I>K</I> if any model from <I>K</I> corresponds to the theory <I>T</I>. A 
      theory <I>T</I> is complete for the class <I>K</I> if for any model of 
      theory <I>T</I> we can find an isomorphic model in <I>K</I>. In natural 
      sciences, it is a rare case if the theory is both consistent and complete. 
      Usually it is consistent with the majority of models or almost consistent 
      with all models. For example, a theory of mammals may include an axiom 
      that mammals don't lay eggs. However there are a few mammal species that 
      lay eggs (e.g., a duckbill).
      <P>Schreider also defined <U>frames</U> as something intermediate between 
      a model and a theory. A frame has a set (as a model) and some of relations 
      between elements. But there are some additional relations that have not 
      been defined yet which should satisfy specific axioms. For example, a 
      fabric can be considered as a frame on which we can put additional color 
      patterns.<A 
      href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment6"><SUP>6)</SUP></A>
      <P>Then a system can be represented as a class of frames (possible 
      representations) with morphisms between these frames. If the state of one 
      frame changes, the state of other frames may change respectively according 
      to morphisms.
      <P>
      <H2>5. Taxonomy and Meronomy</H2>Taxonomy is the method for grouping 
      objects into natural classes which often have a hierarchical structure. 
      <U>Meronomy</U> (a term was introduced by <A 
      href="http://www.gypsymoth.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/time/time.html">Sergei 
      Meyen</A>) is the method for partitioning internal systems and classifying 
      parts ("meros" = part in Greek). Objects in one natural class are 
      characterized by the same theory and usually correspond to a specific term 
      in the human language. A taxonomy is called natural if it allows to 
      predict essential characteristics of objects from the fact that they 
      belong to a specific taxon.<A 
      href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment7"><SUP>7)</SUP></A> 
      Natural classes of whole systems is a taxon, and a class of parts of 
      systems (these parts may belong to various systems or to the same system) 
      is called a <U>meron</U>.
      <P>Biologists claim that natural classification of organisms should always 
      correspond to the phylogenetic tree. Schreider argues with this view: (1) 
      phylogeny is often reconstructed from the analysis of morphology, (2) 
      classifications in other sciences, e.g., in chemistry, are not 
      phylogenetic, and (3) it is possible that organisms on other planets (if 
      they exist) are similar to organisms on the Earth and can be classified 
      together despite the fact that they have no common ancestors.<A 
      href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment8"><SUP>8)</SUP></A>
      <P>Classification groups individuals from a <U>classification 
      universum</U> into taxons. Classification universum is a class with fuzzy 
      boundaries. Generally, it is not clearly defined what is a single organism 
      (e.g., a single stem of a bamboo or the cluster of stems). A species can 
      be defined as a minimal taxon. Then, a higher taxon can be viewed as a 
      subclass of species. Classifications can be hierarchical, combinatorial, 
      and mixed. The class of species can be a regular set, if species are well 
      separated (no fuzziness). But in many cases, species are not well 
      separated. For example, taxonomists often disagree on the status of 
      species and subspecies. Some of them rise subspecies to a species rank. If 
      we classify buildings by their style, then again we will not find clear 
      "species" of style.
      <P>The relationship between taxonomy and meronomy is that each taxon can 
      be characterized by some <U>archetype</U> that is true for all individuals 
      (or species) that belong to this taxon. This assumption is equivalent to 
      the existence of a <U>concept</U> for each notion in the language. 
      Schreider considers an archetype as a frame (see above) built on the set 
      of merons. <U>Homology</U> between parts of systems is the consequence of 
      sharing the same archetype. Each part of a system corresponds to some 
      meron in the archetype. Parts in different systems that correspond to the 
      same meron in the archetype are homologous.
      <P>Each meron may have different states. For example, legs may be more 
      developed in some species and less developed in other species. Also legs 
      may be for running (deer), digging (mole), jumping (kangaroo), swimming 
      (seal), and flying (bats). These are states of the same meron. Merons may 
      have a zero-state, like legs in the snake.
      <P>Both taxons and archetypes have a partial order. Taxons are ordered by 
      inclusion. For example, the taxon of chimps is included in the taxon of 
      primates. Archetype <I>A</I> is greater than archetype <I>B</I> (<I>A</I> 
      &gt; <I>B</I>) if all merons and relations between them in <I>B</I> are 
      present in <I>A</I>. If <I>B</I> has axioms, then all additional merons in 
      <I>A</I> satisfy these axioms. In terms of category theory, there is a 
      monomorphism from <I>B</I> to <I>A</I>. Orders in taxons and archetypes 
      are opposite which was called a <U>duality principle of 
classification</U>:
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG src="Schreider.files/duality.gif">
      <P>Duality principle of classification. Smaller archetype (<I>B</I>) 
      corresponds to a larger taxon <I>T</I>(<I>B</I>).</CENTER>
      <P>Using the terminology of the category theory, <I>T</I> is a 
      contravariant functor to the category of classes. For each archetype it 
      indicates its taxon which is a class.
      <P>Because an archetype is a formal theory of objects that belong to the 
      taxon, they may be used to predict potential variability of members of 
      this taxon. For example, the periodic table of chemical elements predicts 
      potential variability of each group of elements. This method may work even 
      in biology. For example, <A 
      href="http://www.dainet.de/genres/vir/vavilov.htm">Nikolai Vavilov</A> 
      (1992, Origin and geography of cultivated plants) built a periodic system 
      of varieties of cultivated plants. <A 
      href="http://www.gypsymoth.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/time/time.html">Sergei 
      Meyen</A> (1987) built a combinatorial system of leaf segmentation:

      <P>
      <H2>6. Voting systems</H2>Voting systems can be classified into 
      <U>symmetric</U> and <U>asymmetric</U>. In a symmetric voting system, 
      voting rules do not depend on the proposed item. For example, if some set 
      of people voted for <I>A</I> and <I>A</I> was selected, then if the same 
      people had voted for another item <I>B</I>, then item <I>B</I> is 
      selected. In an asymmetric voting, rules depend on the subject of voting. 
      For example, the opinion of experts may be weighted more if the subject of 
      voting is in their area of expertise. But because people are experts in 
      different areas, voting rules will depend on the subject of voting. 
      Schreider studied both kinds of voting systems. He developed a model of 
      coalitions for asymmetric voting and the model of majority structures for 
      symmetric voting.
      <P>Let us assume that the set of people, <I>X</I>, votes for one of 2 
      alternatives: <I>A</I> or <I>B</I>. It is assumed that all people from 
      <I>X</I> participated in voting, each selected only 1 option (<I>A</I> or 
      <I>B</I>), and all ballots were valid. Then axioms of the coalitions are: 
      <OL>
        <LI>The set of all voters, <I>X</I>, is an <I>A</I>-coalition and a 
        <I>B</I>-coalition (axiom of confidence) 
        <LI>If <I>S</I> is an <I>A</I>-coalition (<I>B</I>-coalition), then the 
        <I>X\S</I> is not a <I>B</I>-coalition (<I>A</I>-coalition) (axiom of 
        non-contradiction) 
        <LI>If <I>S</I> is an <I>A</I>-coalition, and <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> 
        includes <I>S</I>, then <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> is an <I>A</I>-coalition 
        (axiom of stability) </LI></OL>Voting systems with coalition have several 
      paradoxes: 
      <OL>
        <LI><A 
        href="http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_Chapter_15/PThy_Chap_15.html">Condorcet 
        Voting Paradox</A> (a more general result is known as Arrow's [1952] 
        impossibility theorem). If each voter has ranked his preferences among 
        the set, <I>M</I>, of possible options, then the entire set of voters 
        may not be able to rank all options. 
        <LI>Paradox of a decisive minority. Decision <I>A</I> can be accepted 
        even if a very small proportion of people voted for <I>A</I>. 
        <LI>The system may not come to a decision. For example, if any decision 
        is accepted only in the case of unanimous vote, then any disagreement 
        will lead to no decision. </LI></OL><U>Majority structure</U> is a set of 
      coalitions among <I>X</I> voters. The axioms of majority structure are 
      similar to axioms for asymmetrical voting: 
      <OL>
        <LI>The set of all voters, <I>X</I>, is a coalition<BR>
        <LI>If <I>S</I> is a coalition, then <I>X\S</I> is not a coalition<BR>
        <LI>If <I>S</I> is a coalition and <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> includes 
        <I>S</I>, then <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> is a coalition.
        <P></P></LI></OL>Examples of majority structures: 
      <OL>
        <LI>Direct equal vote. Any set of n or more voters (<I>n</I> &gt; 
        <I>N/</I>2, where <I>N</I> is the total number of voters) is a 
        coalition. 
        <LI>Direct weighted vote. All voters have fixed weights. The coalition 
        is any set of voters whose total weight is greater than <I>w</I> 
        (<I>w</I> &gt; <I>W/</I>2, where <I>W</I> is total weight of all 
        voters). 
        <LI>Indirect (hierarchical) equal vote. A scheme of hierarchical vote is 
        shown in the figure below. Each group of three people come to a decision 
        with direct vote; then decisions of these groups are considered at the 
        second level of voting. Decisions made at the second level become votes 
        at the third and final level. The majority structure is symmetric which 
        means that all voters have equal effect on the decision. It is 
        interesting that in this voting structure, some coalitions may consist 
        of a very small number of people. One of such coalitions is shown below. 
        It consists of 16 people out of 81 which is less than 20%. </LI></OL>
      <CENTER><IMG src="Schreider.files/voting.gif">
      <P>Squares are voters; they are colored blue if they vote for <I>A</I>, 
      and white if they vote against <I>A</I>. Circles are hierarchical groups 
      of voters that make a decision sequentially according to the majority of 
      elements within a group. Circles are colored blue if the group selects 
      <I>A</I>, and white if it does not select <I>A</I>. The whole system 
      selects <I>A</I> although only 16 people out of 81 voted for 
      <I>A</I>.</CENTER>
      <P>As the total number of voters increases to infinity (and voters have 
      equal rights), the proportion of voters in the smallest coalition may 
      approach zero. However, the number of people in the smallest coalition is 
      always greater than the square root of the total number of voters.
      <P>This model of majority voting can be applied to the problem of 
      identification of systems. Each characteristic can be viewed as a voter, 
      and the decision is to accept or reject the hypothesis that the system 
      corresponds to the archetype. Even if all characteristics are equally 
      important, the decisive role may belong to a relatively small coalition of 
      characteristics. Thus, a system may belong to a taxon even if it has a 
      small number of characteristics that correspond to the archetype.
      <P>
      <H2>Semantic information</H2>Shannon's theory of information defines the 
      quantity of information, but it does not say anything about how it is 
      interpreted by a person who receives this information. May be the 
      interpreter already knows this information and thus, the message is simply 
      redundant and can be ignored. To characterize the meaning of information 
      it is necessary to know how this information changes the knowledge of the 
      interpreter.
      <P>The first step is to define what is knowledge. Knowledge can be viewed 
      as a generalized taxonomy, i.e., as a set of names for taxons and merons 
      which are associated with corresponding archetypes. Because parts of 
      archetypes (merons) belong to the same generalized taxonomy, archetypes 
      define relations between names of taxons and merons. For example, the word 
      "leg" is associated with animals and furniture (table legs), and word 
      "tax" is associated with "IRS".
      <P>Knowledge A can be considered greater than knowledge B if it contains 
      all archetypes from B with possibly added complexity and have some 
      additional archetypes. When a person receives a message, his knowledge 
      usually increases. Let us assume that we managed to measure the amount of 
      knowledge in some relatively narrow area. Then the increment of knowledge 
      after receiving a message can be plotted against the amount of initial 
      knowledge:
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG src="Schreider.files/knowldg.gif">
      <P>The initial of knowledge affects the amount of information that can be 
      extracted from a text (knowledge increment).</CENTER>
      <P>Small initial knowledge is insufficient to understand the message and 
      the increment of knowledge is small. As initial knowledge increases, the 
      interpreter understands the message in more details and the increment of 
      knowledge grows. But at some point, the interpreter finds that he already 
      knows some information in the message. After that the increment of 
      knowledge decreases and eventually reaches zero at the point where the 
      interpreter does not find anything new in the message.
      <P>Of course, this figure is an oversimplification because two knowledges 
      may be quantitatively equal but essentially different qualitatively even 
      if they are limited to a specific area. But nevertheless, this figure 
      captures some important characteristics of information processing. First, 
      knowledge can not grow without preliminary knowledge. Second, redundant 
      information does not increase knowledge.
      <P>If initial knowledge is insufficient, then the text is understood only 
      syntactically. For example, when we read a book in a foreign language 
      which we don't know very well, we understand the structure of sentences 
      and most of the words. But we get only a vague idea of its contents. 
      Computer programs are able to understand the syntax of computer code but 
      they do not understand the purpose of this code.
      <P>The next level of understanding captures literal semantics. At this 
      level it is possible to understand technical texts, e.g., scientific 
      papers, but it is impossible to understand jokes or parables. The next 
      level of understanding is deep semantics include jokes, the purpose and 
      main idea of the text, philosophical background of the author. Finally, 
      there may be a dialog with a text, e.g., if you return to this text many 
      times and always find something new. In this case, understanding is not a 
      state but a process.
      <P>The question is why information can not be understood without some 
      preliminary information? Schreider suggests that in order to understand 
      some information we need to know how it is structured. Thus, preliminary 
      information can be called metainformation because it is information about 
      information. This idea is closely related to the idea of metalanguages 
      suggested by Tarski. Regular information is what we call "facts", but 
      metainformation is the knowledge about how these facts are organized. In 
      other words, metainformation is the theory of knowledge, i.e., 
methodology.
      <P>Language is the carrier of semantics, and the depth of semantics 
      depends of the structure of the language. Schreider considers 3 kinds of 
      languages:
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Non-hierarchical sign systems. Each sign is not structured and its 
        meaning can not be derived from the sign<A 
        href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/biosem/schreidr/schreidr.html#comment9"><SUP>9)</SUP></A>. 

        <LI>Hierarchical sign systems in which the meaning of each sign is 
        determined by its parts. For example, the meaning of a sentence can be 
        completely understood from the meaning of individual words. This kind of 
        context-free languages are used for computer programming. 
        <LI>Hierarchical context-dependent languages. In these languages, the 
        meaning of signs depends on a broad context created by the whole text. 
        <LI>Poly-structured languages. Messages in these languages may combine 
        several structures. For example, speech combines words with intonation 
        which is some times more important than words. Poems combine words with 
        rhythm and rhyme. Translation of poems is extremely difficult and often 
        impossible because it should represent several structures. </LI></OL>
      <H2>Goals and values</H2>Do we follow goals in our behavior? It appears 
      that goals are not used as often as we may think. A goal-oriented behavior 
      means that we optimize our actions in order to reach a specific event at a 
      minimum cost. For example, if we want to buy a new TV, we first save some 
      money, then go shopping and check prices, and finally our goal is reached: 
      we got a TV. Goal-oriented behavior always have a time limit. After we 
      bought a TV, we will do something different.
      <P>Instead of setting goals, humans are more often follow some rules of 
      rituals in their behavior that are not oriented to some final event for 
      the sake of which they are done. For example, if we save money we often 
      have very vague ideas about what we are going to do with this money (e.g., 
      after retirement). If we watch TV we may find it generally entertaining 
      and may be useful, but we never watch TV for the sake of some higher goal. 
      People rarely make love just because they want a baby. Usually love has a 
      value on its own.
      <P>Goals are often seen in systems that have no goals. For example, among 
      all possible trajectories from point <I>A</I> to point <I>B</I> light 
      always goes by the one that requires minimum time. For example, if the 
      speed of light in glass is slower than in the air, then light refracts as 
      shown in this figure:
      <P>
      <CENTER><IMG src="Schreider.files/refract.gif">
      <P>Among all possible trajectories from point <I>A</I> to point <I>B</I> 
      light always selects the fastest one.</CENTER>
      <P>This can be interpreted as if light has a goal to get to the point B as 
      fast as possible. However, this is not a goal because: 
      <OL>
        <LI>If we turn the source of light it will not get to point B, but goals 
        requires stability. Goal-directed behavior should be able to compensate 
        disturbances. 
        <LI>Light can not make a mistake and take a wrong path, and it cannot be 
        deceived. This means that light has no internal freedom. 
        <LI>Reaching point B is not necessary the end of light trajectory. It 
        can go farther. But when the goal is reached, the system should not 
        leave it immediately. The state that is immediately left behind can not 
        be a goal. </LI></OL>Schreider formulates 3 features of a goal: 
      <OL>
        <LI>It should be reachable 
        <LI>But it is not necessary reached (in the case of an error) 
        <LI>The goal should be unique (the goal justifies the means) </LI></OL>If 
      a system has a goal, this goal is relatively easy to test. What is needed 
      is to make various obstacles and observe if the system is capable of 
      compensating behavior. It is much harder to prove that the system has no 
      goal. The absence of means to reach the goal may be erroneously 
      interpreted as the absence of the goal.
      <P>Goal-directed behavior is a good model for a criminal investigation. 
      For example, punishment depends on whether the murder was intentional or 
      incidental. It is sufficient for the court to know that the murder was 
      intentional (i.e., goal-directed behavior), and it does not matter why the 
      person had that goal.
      <P>If we want to understand a person deeper, we have to go beyond goals. 
      Each goal requires an explanation why this specific event became a goal. 
      And the only explanation for a goal is a system of values. If a person is 
      consistent in selection of his goals this may indicate the presence of a 
      specific system of values. Goals are external for the system but values 
      are internal. Results of goal-directed behavior may have some value even 
      if the goal was not reached. For example, if we learn by tries and errors, 
      an error is usually not an ultimate failure but a part of a learning 
      process. The proof of the impossibility to reach some goal may be very 
      important for planning future activities.
      <P>In value-directed behavior, there is no dominance of the higher-level 
      element over lower-level elements (goal justifies the means), but instead, 
      all elements of the hierarchy have some value. In goal-directed behavior, 
      the freedom is limited by the goal. The system may select means to reach 
      the goal, but the goal can not be changed. In value-oriented behavior, 
      goals can be selected according to values, and thus the person have more 
      freedom.
      <P>
      <H2>Comments</H2><A name=comment1>1. </A>Internal and external systems can 
      be interpreted as systems pointed by two kinds of signs: indexes and icons 
      (Peirce). Internal systems are pointed by indexes, and external systems 
      are pointed by icons (archetypes). An icon points to a class of systems 
      rather than to an individual system. The notion of a class was invented by 
      mathematicians to escape paradoxes of the set theory; thus, a class is 
      always considered as something like a set but not exactly a set. This 
      interpretation assumes that a class is a multiplicity of objects. However, 
      if a class is a multiplicity, then it contains indexes to individuals, and 
      hence it becomes a mixture of both kinds of signs (icons and indexes). I 
      suggest interpreting a class as a pure icon (archetype) that does not have 
      any explicit multiplicity. However, to build an archetype we need to 
      compare several representatives that (we believe) belong to the class. If 
      human knowledge increases we may need to change our classification of 
      objects in the world. To follow the evolution of archetypes it is 
      important to keep several representatives of a class (a set of indexes). 
      Biologists use holotypes for this purpose.
      <P><A name=comment2>2. </A>Existence of an archetype-essence implies the 
      existence of a super-observer (God) who grasps the essence of things 
      (Schreider was a Catholic). Apparently, the existence of archetype-essence 
      was needed as a basis for natural classifications and for normative 
      ethics. My personal view is that we don't need neither natural 
      classifications nor unified normative ethics. I believe that various 
      classifications and various ethical systems compete for human minds. 
      Different ethical systems may coexist by finding niches in different human 
      communities. This view is well elaborated by Matt Nuenke in his paper <A 
      href="http://pw2.netcom.com/~nuenke/mor.htm">The immorality of morals and 
      the future of amorality</A>.
      <P><A name=comment3>3. </A>The difference between models and theories is 
      not absolute. We may reserve a set of names for individual elements of the 
      set in the model. These names can be viewed as unary relationships. Thus, 
      we can interpret models as theories of the lowest level. Then we develop 
      mere general theories (higher levels) that can be represented by multiple 
      models. The hierarchy of theories can be defined as follows: theory T2 is 
      more specific than theory T1 (T2 &gt; T1) if their relationships have same 
      names, N, and if any axiom of theory T1 can be derived from axioms of 
      theory T2. Then models can be defined as most specific theories. In the 
      case of infinite sets, most specific theories may have an infinite number 
      of axioms which does not fit to our intuitive notion of a theory or proof 
      (Goedel's theorem). But models with infinite number of elements are 
      equally contraintuitive because it is impossible to observe all its 
      elements.
      <P><A name=comment4>4. </A>If the model has an infinite number of elements 
      it may take infinite time (or infinite computer) to test that it satisfies 
      the theory.
      <P><A name=comment5>5. </A>This statement seems to ignore the importance 
      of measurement. I prefer to say that records of system measuring (e.g., 
      observations of planets in the solar system) may appear to be a model of 
      some theory.
      <P><A name=comment6>6. </A>I believe that the notion of a frame is 
      redundant because models can be viewed as most specific theories (see 
      comment 3). Thus, a frame is just a theory at some intermediate level of 
      hierarchy.
      <P><A name=comment7>7. </A>Multiplicity of representations of the same 
      object implies that there may be several classifications for the same 
      group of objects. Schreider claims that there is some optimization 
      principle according to which some classifications are better (more 
      "natural") than others. I would argue that the quality of a classification 
      depends on the way it is used for practical purposes. Thus, some 
      classifications are more "natural" for one group of users whereas other 
      classifications are more "natural" for other users. There is no 
      classification that equally satisfies everyone. If there is a need to have 
      one classification as a standard for everybody, then voting could be a 
      good way to decide which classification to select. But I would not call it 
      "natural".
      <P><A name=comment8>8. </A>Molecular biology has accurate methods for 
      estimating phylogenetic relationships without considering morphological 
      characteristics. I believe, there is no need to argue which system is more 
      "natural". Apparently, both systems based on morphology and phylogeny are 
      useful. Because they largely coincide, there is no sufficient reason to 
      oppose one of them to another (except a few cases). Thus, I don't mind to 
      use the phylogenetic system, although I agree with Schreider that a good 
      classification can be built solely based on morphology (as it has been 
      traditionally done for centuries).
      <P><A name=comment9>9. </A>Schreider use the term language in a broad 
      sense as any system of signs. I prefer to reserve the term 'language' only 
      for hierarchically structured systems of signs. However, there is no 
      generally accepted term for non-hierarchical systems of signs. I suggest 
      to use the neutral term 'semantic repertoire' for any kind of sign 
      systems, including languages.
