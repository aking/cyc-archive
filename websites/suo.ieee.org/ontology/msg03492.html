All,
	I'm sure John has a point here, but I can't tell what he's saying,
so it's hard for me to tell him this was yet another wasted post.  

	Could someone translate this for me.  Thanks.

Jim

graham,

maybe it's just the perspective of time -- monday morning quarterbacking? --
but i do not get the sense that i ever got across what I was trying to
say on this score.  actually, this issue comes up in a general context
under many different names:  informal contexts versus formal arenas,
everyday ontologies versus un-common-sense ontologies, freaks/neats,
popular writing versus technical writing.  it's a big obstacle to
communication in peirce studies because peirce wrote stuff that
was very technical and stuff that was published in popular and
humanities journals, and you just cant do both without creating --
what was the word i just heard? -- barrels of &quot;heterogeneity&quot;
headed for the falls of sheer inconsistency.  i actually
went back and re-read some of albert einstein's popular
works to see if he did a better job than peirce, and,
no, you cant really expect to pilot the enterprise
with the level of detail you find there.

moral of the story:  there's an &quot;essential tension&quot; here, to borrow an old
coin,
you cant eliminate either pole of it, but only string more lines across the
gap.

suggest that a move is

&gt; 
&gt; Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; More later, maybe, but my primary and standard recommendation,
&gt; now and most likely in each future discussion, will be that
&gt; you (y'all) write up a KIF-free version of your ontology
&gt; in the style of a standard math/logic monograph, so that
&gt; it can be read by people who know &amp; love math/logic,
&gt; but are not likely to ever read anything in KIF.
&gt; 
&gt; Auxiliary standard recommendation:  I hope you (y'all) are fully cognizant
&gt; of the responsibility that you must shoulder to educate the voting
populace,
&gt; both here in this forum and beyond its now so narrow walls, about what the
&gt; heck category theory is good for and why.  There is just no other way to
&gt; skin this CAT.
&gt; 
&gt; 'nuff said, fer now,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/">http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; has links to the current version of the IFF Foundation Ontology,
&gt; &gt; as well as links to previous versions, changes, and comments digested as
&gt; &gt; of November 2, 2001.  Note that if your browser has cached this page,
&gt; &gt; you may need to reload it to see the new material.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Appended at the end of this email is a summary of the changes since the
&gt; &gt; previous version.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We realize that there are outstanding questions and concerns that
&gt; &gt; need to be addressed.  We hope that the revised Introduction will
&gt; &gt; speak to some of these concerns. In the future we will post a new
&gt; &gt; Model Theory Ontology, as well as revisions of the Category Theory
&gt; &gt; and Classification Ontologies. We hope that these postings will also
&gt; &gt; address many of your concerns.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please send your comments in response to this message, with Subject
&gt; &gt; &quot;IFF updates 2001-12-05, comments requested&quot; so that we can easily
&gt; &gt; extract this set of comments from the list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you all for your contributions and your patience.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (Please send any link problems or site irregularities to me off list.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On behalf of the IFF Editing Team,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jim Farrugia
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WHAT HAS NOT CHANGED (YET):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  The IFF CategoryTheory(sub)Ontology.pdf
&gt; &gt;  The IFF Classification(sub)Ontology.pdf
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WHAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Introduction.htm has been completely reworked.
&gt; &gt;  It is now called IFFFoundationOntology.htm.
&gt; &gt;  IFF Core Ontology has been modified.
&gt; &gt;  The major changes are:  deletion of topos theory material
&gt; &gt;  (since it has not been used so far in either the IFF
&gt; &gt;  Classification Ontology or the IFF Category Theory Ontology);
&gt; &gt;  addition of a generic framework for limits;
&gt; &gt;  addition of the dual axiomatization for colimits
&gt; &gt;  (used in the IFF Classification Ontology).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WHAT IS NEW:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * IFF BasicKIFOntology
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WHAT IS YET TO COME:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; updates to Classification and Category Theory ontologies a new Model
Theory Ontology
&gt; &gt;
