Matthew --
   Just to get back on one or two points:


&gt; MW: I consider time dependent attributes to be indicative of states of
&gt; something.
&gt; 
   This is a reasonable way to handle such attributes.  I just use
a different terminology -- I like to consider a "state" as the set
of all of the time-variable attributes of an object at a particular 
time.  The term "state" has been used in different senses, such as in
Petri Nets and in computer science to describe an attribute-value
that persists for some period of time.  To avoid debates over
terminology, it may be a good idea to eschew the term "state"
itself and use more specific terms like "instantaneous_state"
or "persistent_state"  (once we decide how to define them).

&gt; The long answer is that the STEP community has developed (I 
&gt; guess) about 20,000 pages of standards on how to represent 
&gt; engineering  data in ISO 10303
&gt; - Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 13584 - Parts
&gt; Libraries, ISO 15531 - Manufacturing Management Data, ISO 15926 Data
&gt; Integration for Process Plant facilities including Oil and 
&gt; Gas, ISO 18876 -
&gt; Integration of Industrial Data for Exchange Access and Sharing.
&gt; 
&gt; These have shown interest in a number of types of relationship between
&gt; "parts" and possible parts, and versions etc.
&gt; 
   I've only been able to look at a small part of the STEP specifications,
and it looks like there are a lot of useful ideas there, such as the
catalog of concepts related to shape.  I haven't found the sections
related to "possible parts".  I will try to find it -- if you have a 
specific reference, it could be very helpful for me.

&gt; Subject: RE: RE: RE: CYC, Time, and Different Ontologies
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Pat,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Matthew --
&gt; &gt;    Thanks for the clarification:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The port engine on a plane is an example of an object that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; can have periods of non-existence. When one engine is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; removed for maintenance, and replaced by another. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, your description of Pat's intent is sufficiently
&gt; &gt; &gt; unconstrained to cover that case.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    This is an important issue, and I will provide my
&gt; &gt; current thoughts on it.
&gt; &gt;    This phenomenon is not one I would represent as being
&gt; &gt; some form of intermittent "concrete_existence".  I would reserve 
&gt; &gt; "concrete_existence" for individual objects.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: In my book the port engine of my plane (I wish) is an individual.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A specification of the
&gt; &gt; parts for some artefact, or prototypical natural object, is a 
&gt; &gt; definition
&gt; &gt; of some class of objects, which a particular object in the 
&gt; real world 
&gt; &gt; may or may not conform to.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Of course the set which you refer to here exists as well, 
&gt; but it is not
&gt; what I am referring to. I am referring to the port engine I can touch.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; To be consistent, I think such definitions
&gt; &gt; need to refer to prototypes or "complete" objects.  The individual 
&gt; &gt; parts may be classified as "vital", "essential" "typical", 
&gt; "optional",
&gt; &gt; "disjoint-alternate", or "accessory" -- for example.  The 
&gt; &gt; assertions of 
&gt; &gt; the "presence" or "absence" of some designed part of an artefact at 
&gt; &gt; some particular time and place, whether it is connected as 
&gt; &gt; intended in 
&gt; &gt; the design, and whether it is functional, are time-dependent 
&gt; &gt; assertions 
&gt; &gt; about specific instances of objects that don't change the 
&gt; &gt; definition of 
&gt; &gt; the complete artefact.   
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This is just one viewpoint on what is going on. I would 
&gt; say that there
&gt; are states of particular jet engines that are co-extensive 
&gt; with states of
&gt; the port engine of my plane.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A particular artefact that can serve 
&gt; &gt; the role of
&gt; &gt; a part of a plane may or may not be designated as "belonging"
&gt; &gt; to some particular plane (e.g. while being repaired), which is 
&gt; &gt; not the same as saying that it is "in-place" and 
&gt; &gt; "functional".  I would
&gt; &gt; view these latter three assertions as time-dependent slots 
&gt; &gt; (or axioms) 
&gt; &gt; on the specific instance of a part itself.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This is just another relation a particular engine can 
&gt; have to my plane,
&gt; and even my planes port engine.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    Assuming that some instance of an artefact such as a plane is 
&gt; &gt; sufficiently intact to be termed a plane, even though 
&gt; incomplete, it 
&gt; &gt; should have time-dependent attributes such as "complete", or 
&gt; &gt; "functional".  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I consider time dependent attributes to be indicative of states of
&gt; something.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If "incomplete" there will be some list of parts that 
&gt; &gt; are "missing".  Whether an artefact can be pulled apart and 
&gt; &gt; cease its "existence" and then be re-assembled and said
&gt; &gt; to exist again under the same instance-name is a convention that
&gt; &gt; depends on "identity criteria", which Guarino has labored much
&gt; &gt; to clarify.  If there is some single vital part (fuselage?)
&gt; &gt; which by convention defines whether some object exists or not, 
&gt; &gt; regardless of the presence of other parts, then intermittent 
&gt; &gt; existence should not occur; the "incomplete" artefact would exist
&gt; &gt; as soon as the vital part came into existence, and cease to exist 
&gt; &gt; when that vital part ceased to exist (and recursively for the
&gt; &gt; "vital part").  Alternatively, existence could be said to 
&gt; begin only 
&gt; &gt; when some artefact has achieved functionality at some time, and 
&gt; &gt; subsequent existence might be defined as being existence of the 
&gt; &gt; vital part.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I agree that "what" you choose to be the identity 
&gt; criteria is arbitrary,
&gt; and different people can make different choices about what they are
&gt; interested in. This can be a cause of so called fuzziness.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;     This may not seem to conform to intuitive or linguistic
&gt; &gt; usage, but linguistic usage is fairly broad.  I've heard people 
&gt; &gt; say, e.g., that "John's car is scattered all over his 
&gt; driveway.  He's 
&gt; &gt; getting the heads planed."  The existence of John's car is not
&gt; &gt; questioned in such a case, but its physical state of division 
&gt; &gt; certainly
&gt; &gt; doesn't conform to a definition of a prototypical connected and
&gt; &gt; functional object.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: An object does not have to have current existence to be 
&gt; able to refer to
&gt; it. I can refer to Winston Churchill, who no longer exists, 
&gt; and I can refer
&gt; to my holiday next year which does not yet have existence.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd be interested to learn what you think
&gt; &gt; is the best way to represent all the possible permutations of
&gt; &gt; parts, including multiple alternative replacements, even sticking
&gt; &gt; only to artefacts.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I do spatio-temporal analysis to find the life-cycle 
&gt; patterns of the
&gt; different objects, relations and the classes they are members 
&gt; of. After that
&gt; it is a matter of what you are interested in. If you would 
&gt; care to give a
&gt; specific example we could examine it.
&gt; 
&gt; The long answer is that the STEP community has developed (I 
&gt; guess) about
&gt; 20,000 pages of standards on how to represent engineering 
&gt; data in ISO 10303
&gt; - Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 13584 - Parts
&gt; Libraries, ISO 15531 - Manufacturing Management Data, ISO 15926 Data
&gt; Integration for Process Plant facilities including Oil and 
&gt; Gas, ISO 18876 -
&gt; Integration of Industrial Data for Exchange Access and Sharing.
&gt; 
&gt; These have shown interest in a number of types of relationship between
&gt; "parts" and possible parts, and versions etc.
