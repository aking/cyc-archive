John,
   Thanks for the more extensive set of references.  In my zeal to commend 
exploration of computational linguistics to this list I may have been too 
quick to state that sweeping groups of people might not be aware of this 
research.

&gt;You keep citing them all the time.  For granularity, you cited
&gt;Jerry Hobbs.  WordNet is perhaps the most widely used collection
&gt;of categories, and it was done by a psychologist, George Miller,
&gt;who has been hanging out with linguists for the past 40+ years.
&gt;And there are quite a few logicians who hang out with computational
&gt;linguists, especially when working on theories of modality,
&gt;tense logics, etc.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Adam, can you cite any? I havn't come across many such insights from
&gt; &gt; computational linguistics in KR.
&gt;
&gt;Following is a book review I wrote (which is scheduled for the
&gt;March 2001 issue of _Computational Linguistics_) of a book by
&gt;a linguist, M. A. K. Halliday, who has a lot of interesting ideas
&gt;related to topics in ontology.  (I had to make some minor adjustments
&gt;to let it slip through your filter.)

&gt;
&gt;Construing Experience through Meaning:
&gt;A language-based approach to cognition
&gt;
&gt;by M. A. K. Halliday and Christian M. I. M. Matthiessen
&gt;
&gt;London and New York:  Cassell, 1999
&gt;xiii+657 pp; paperback, ISBN 0-304-70490-3, $102.00
&gt;
&gt;reviewed by John F. Sowa
&gt;
&gt;Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday has been actively analyzing and
&gt;documenting the interactions between syntax and semantics for over forty
&gt;years, and his systemic-functional theory has been a foundation for
&gt;important work in computational linguistics for at least thirty years.
&gt;The first major application of systemic theory was the SHRDLU system
&gt;by Winograd (1972).  The largest ongoing series of applications has
&gt;been developed at the USC Information Sciences Institute:  language
&gt;generation (Mann 1982; Hovy 1988); discourse analysis and rhetorical
&gt;structure (Mann &amp; Thompson 1992); and the interface between the lexicon
&gt;and world knowledge (Bateman et al. 1990; Matthiessen 1995).
&gt;
&gt;In this book, Halliday and Matthiessen present a comprehensive survey
&gt;of semantics and its relationships to syntax and cognition.  Although
&gt;they present their subject from a systemic-functional point of view,
&gt;they show how their approach is related to a wide range of work in both
&gt;computational and theoretical linguistics.  One notable omission from
&gt;their 23-page bibliography is Noam Chomsky, whose period of active
&gt;research almost exactly coincides with Halliday's.  They do, however,
&gt;give a fair summary of semantic theories based on Chomsky's approach,
&gt;ranging from the early work of Katz and Fodor to the more recent work
&gt;by Jackendoff.
&gt;
&gt;The book consists of fifteen chapters organized in five parts.
&gt;In Part I, the authors contrast the systemic approach with a view
&gt;of knowledge representation as a "piecemeal accumulation" of concepts
&gt;with "no overall organization."  Instead of treating language "as a
&gt;kind of code in which pre-existing conceptual structures are more or
&gt;less distortedly expressed," they view language as a semiotic system
&gt;that serves "as the foundation of human experience."  The goal of
&gt;systemic theory is to present a comprehensive view of how humans
&gt;construe experience through language.  Unlike Chomsky, they do not
&gt;consider grammar as "autonomous" but as an integral part of the
&gt;_lexicogrammar_, which _realizes_ meaning in words, phrases, sentences,
&gt;and paragraphs.
&gt;
&gt;Part II, comprising chapters 2 through 7, presents the _meaning base_,
&gt;which corresponds to what many authors would call an ontology.  The
&gt;meaning base, however, represents categories of experience with a
&gt;topmost node called _phenomenon_ instead of categories of existence
&gt;with a topmost node called _entity_.  The first subdivision of phenomena
&gt;is a three-way partitioning according to levels of complexity:
&gt;
&gt;  1. Elementary ideas or _elements_ are realized by the lexicogrammar
&gt;     as words or short groups of words, such as _rain_, _from the west_,
&gt;     or _8 hard-boiled eggs_.  Computationally, elements may be
&gt;     represented by slots in a frame, nodes in a graph, or typed
&gt;     variables in logic.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Configurations of elements or _figures_ are realized by phrases
&gt;     or clauses, such as _rain ending from the west_ or _chop finely_.
&gt;     Computationally, a figure may be represented by various data
&gt;     structures, such as a frame, list, or graph.
&gt;
&gt;  3. Complexes of figures or _sequences_ are realized by complex
&gt;     sentences or paragraphs, such as _Take 8 hard-boiled eggs, chop
&gt;     finely, mash with 3 tablespoons of soft butter, and add salt and
&gt;     pepper_.  Computationally, a sequence could be represented by
&gt;     a network of frames, a list of lists, a graph of graphs, or
&gt;     structures of objects in an object-oriented language.
&gt;
&gt;Each of these categories is further divided and subdivided by various
&gt;distinctions, some dyadic and some triadic.  Element is classified as
&gt;participant, circumstance, or process.  Figure is classified by another
&gt;triad of relational (being or having), material (doing or happening),
&gt;and mental (sensing or saying).  These categories are further elaborated
&gt;and illustrated with numerous examples.  To demonstrate the generality
&gt;of the approach, Chapter 7 shows how the semantic categories realized
&gt;in English can also be realized in Chinese and other languages.
&gt;
&gt;Part III consists of two chapters that show how the theory can be
&gt;implemented in a computational system for language generation, with
&gt;examples of weather reports and cooking recipes.  Part IV consists of
&gt;three chapters that compare the theoretical and descriptive techniques
&gt;of systemic-functional theory to other approaches.  The concluding Part
&gt;V consists of three chapters that apply systemic theory to an analysis
&gt;of how humans construe experience through language.  Chapter 14 has
&gt;an intriguing analysis of the evolution of linguistic expressions
&gt;from folk theories to scientific theories.  Instead of drawing a sharp
&gt;dichotomy between commonsense and scientific ways of thinking, the
&gt;authors show how the basic linguistic mechanisms of abstraction and
&gt;metaphor are used to systematize and formalize scientific language.
&gt;Metaphor is fundamental to both science and poetry.  The primary
&gt;difference is that poets constantly strive to create novel metaphors,
&gt;while scientists recycle, revise, and elaborate the most successful
&gt;of their colleagues' metaphors.
&gt;
&gt;In summary, this book makes a strong case for the systemic approach as
&gt;a fruitful alternative to Chomsky's view of autonomous syntax.  The
&gt;authors demonstrate that semantics has important structures that are
&gt;cross-linguistic and formalizable.  Although they present their data
&gt;with the terminology, notation, and viewpoint of the systemic-functional
&gt;approach, their analyses, distinctions, and categories can be adapted
&gt;to semantic theories based on other approaches.
&gt;
&gt;The authors criticize the logic-based, model-theoretic approaches for
&gt;their limited ontologies and neglect of important aspects of language,
&gt;such as metaphor.  Yet logicians recognize the need for richer
&gt;ontologies, and many, if not most would agree that semantics is the
&gt;proper starting point for a study of natural language.  The authors
&gt;try to draw a sharp distinction between the deductive methods of logic
&gt;and the method of inheritance used in frame-based systems.  A logician,
&gt;however, would reply that inheritance is the oldest of all rules of
&gt;inference; it was introduced by Aristotle for syllogisms, and it is
&gt;a derived rule in every modern system of logic.  The methods of
&gt;unification used in many logic-based systems implement inheritance
&gt;in ways that are equivalent to or more general than frame systems.
&gt;Rather than being a competitor, the systemic approach can be
&gt;a valuable complement to the logic-based approaches.
&gt;
&gt;The authors consider language as a semiotic system, but they only
&gt;mention the dyadic view of semiotics developed by Saussure and
&gt;linguists influenced by Saussure, such as Hjelmslev and Firth.  CSP
&gt;analyzed the sign relation in greater depth than Saussure and emphasized
&gt;its irreducible triadic nature.  Although Halliday and Mattheissen never
&gt;mention CSP, they have rediscovered many of CSP's triads in their
&gt;systemic analysis.  Their choice of _phenomenon_ as the most general
&gt;category is an unconscious endorsement of CSP's point that his
&gt;categories were primarily phenomenological rather than ontological.
&gt;The systemic triad of being-having, doing-happening, and sensing-saying
&gt;corresponds to CSP's fundamental triad of Quality, Reaction, and
&gt;Representation.  Most of the other triads in the systemic meaning base
&gt;also have a strong CSP flavor, and a more conscious application
&gt;of CSP's version of semiotics might help clarify and refine many
&gt;of the triadic distinctions in the systemic approach.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps the least attractive feature of the book is its formatting.
&gt;The authors used a conventional word processor to print camera-ready copy
&gt;on A4 paper, which the publisher reproduced without change.  The result
&gt;is a heavy, unwieldy tome with a great deal of wasted paper, a generally
&gt;unfinished appearance, but a price tag of $102.  With that price and
&gt;format, the book is destined to sell very few copies, the authors will
&gt;get little or nothing in royalties, the publisher's high price will seem
&gt;to be justified, and a potentially important book will never be read
&gt;by students who might profit from it.  The book would get better
&gt;distribution if the authors had simply put the electronic version on
&gt;their web site; better yet, professional societies such as the ACL
&gt;should put books such as this on their web sites.
