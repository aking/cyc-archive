&gt;Subject: RE: SUO: RE: KIF syntax and semantics and a basic ontology
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; One thing we do have is the ability to give a bunch of axioms a name,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; and then include them in another module by using the name.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;MW: As long as that was recurcsive, i.e. the module referred to would
&gt;
&gt;pull in the modules it in turn referred to, then this would I believe
&gt;
&gt;meet the requirement. How does the syntax look?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The following is a DRAFT of a PROPOSAL to an UNOFFICIAL AD_HOC WORKING GROUP
&gt;which has not even been ACCEPTED by them, so it is about as far from being
&gt;approved as anything can get. That said, I would welcome any feedback.:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;------
&gt;
&gt;Namespaces and inclusion
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;An ontology (traditionally called a 'theory' in logic) is a set of
&gt;assertional expressions. Each ontology has an associated vocabulary or
&gt;namespace, defined to be all the identifiers used in its expressions, other
&gt;than those with a predefined logical meaning. A KIF ontology can be given a
&gt;name, which can be indicated in KIF by enclosing all the expressions of the
&gt;ontology, preceded by the word "ontology" and the name itself, within
&gt;parentheses. Such an expression is called an ontology form. (We use this
&gt;label, rather than "expression", since the form does not denote anything,
&gt;but indicates a set of axioms by ostention.) Such a name of the ontology is
&gt;considered to be part of the ontology namespace, so must be distinct from
&gt;other symbols in that namespace; it is called a local name.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Other methods for giving names to ontologies are acceptable. In particular,
&gt;the ontology may reside on a web page, or in a computer file, in which case
&gt;the URI of the page, or the name of the file, may be used as names for the
&gt;ontology (provided they are KIF lexical items. They can usually be made
&gt;acceptable by inserting backslashes in front of any interlexical
&gt;characters.) These are intended to have a scope which extends beyond the
&gt;ontology itself, so are called global names. KIF assumes that some external
&gt;process is capable of accessing the ontology named by a global name, so the
&gt;exact form of global names is not mandated by the KIF standard. Some
&gt;convention should be establsihed which guarantees the uniqueness of global
&gt;ontology names within any proposed community of usage. Following current
&gt;practice, URI's used as global ontology names are taken to refer to a KIF
&gt;ontology at the location indicated by the URI. [ref:
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/</A> ]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ontologies can be combined in two ways.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;An ontology can include another simply by containing an ontology form for
&gt;the other ontology.
&gt;
&gt;MW: What does this mean?

Precisely what it says: the ontology form for A is included as a wff 
in the ontology B.

&gt; In this way one ontology can simply be included inside another, and its
&gt;sentences are considered to be a subset of those in the including ontology ,
&gt;and the namespace of the included ontology is part of that of the including
&gt;ontology. In effect, the inner ontology form provides a name for a subset of
&gt;the sentences of the larger ontology, simply as a book-keeping convenience.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;MW: I think this is more accurately a way of defining a module within some
&gt;ontology as a named part (if I read you correctly)

Yes, you could view it that way. It is a way of labelling part of an 
ontology as also being a distinct ontology. This would be much use by 
itself (except as a documentation convenience, and suchlike), but it 
provides a way for these sub-ontologies (?) to be imported into other 
ontologies.

&gt; but I'm really not sure.
&gt;In particular I'm not sure whether or not it is valid for an ontology to be
&gt;included in two other distinct ontologies.

Sure, no problem. Ontologies are just sets of sentences, and we can 
mix and match them any way we like.

&gt;MW: What syntax is used for this?

See below.

&gt;
&gt;An ontology can also be imported by including an expression consisting of
&gt;the word "imports" and the name of the ontology, enclosed in parentheses.
&gt;(The notion of importing is intended to be the same as that used in DAML+OIL
&gt;[ref: <A  HREF="http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil-index">http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil-index</A> ] .) This allows an
&gt;ontology to include content from ontologies accessed remotely, for example
&gt;from another website, or from elsewhere in an intranet filing system.
&gt;Importation differs from inclusion in that the namespace of the importing
&gt;ontology is disjoint from that of the imported ontology.
&gt;
&gt;MW: So the same name could appear in both ontologies but with different
&gt;meanings?

Yes, but the name in the imported ontology would seem different when 
viewed from the importing one, to avoid any potential confusions.

&gt; To refer to something with name &lt;name&gt; in &lt;namespace&gt; from outside that
&gt;namespace, one writes &lt;namespace&gt;#&lt;name&gt;. For example, if an ontology called
&gt;'arithmetic' uses the function name 'plus', then the name of this function
&gt;will be 'arithmetic#plus' elsewhere in any ontology which contains the
&gt;expression '(imports arithmetic)'. In this way ontologies may include axioms
&gt;which use vocabulary introduced in other ontologies.
&gt;
&gt; (Note. There is one exception to this rule, where one ontology consists
&gt;entirely of declarations and no #-prefixing is required. This is used only
&gt;in sorted KIF.)
&gt;
&gt;MW: Can you give an example please.

The idea was simply to allow 'ontologies' consisting entirely of 
vocabulary declarations, to be imported into other ontologies using 
the declared names without prefixes. We may allow this (no-prefix) as 
a general option in any case, as some folk have requested it.

&gt;As a convenience, an ontology can be given a local name in the importing
&gt;expression, eg
&gt;
&gt;(imports ar <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic">http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic</A>)
&gt;
&gt;indicates that the ontology at that URL is imported, but that the prefix
&gt;'ar#' is sufficient to identify words from its namespace. Such a local name
&gt;is considered to be part of the namespace of the ontology containing the
&gt;importing expression. The effect of such an importing expression is the same
&gt;as including the imported ontology with every nonlogical symbol #-prefixed
&gt;by the local name.
&gt;
&gt;MW: EXPRESS goes one step further than this and allows you to give a local
&gt;name to any element in the imported ontology - with a default of the same
&gt;name (somewhere between includes and imports).

Yes, this is something like the view we are coming to, but applied to 
the entire imported ontology. Allowing a name-by-name distinction 
seems way too clunky to me; it would make the business of importing 
almost as long-winded as including the ontology in the first place.

It is always possible to assert that a local name is identical to an 
imported name, eg one can say
(= plus  <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic#plus">http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic#plus</A>). The idea is not 
to make this kind of close name-binding impossible, only to make sure 
it doesnt happen by accident, as it were.

&gt;MW: You introduce "#" as a name separator. This needs some official status
&gt;in KIF.

Yes, it will be one of the limited list of 'special characters' that 
have a special syntactic significance. Others include (currently) : ? 
( ) \ @ = &gt; &lt; . " and '  The idea is to keep this list as short as 
reasonably possible.

&gt;Importation is considered to be transitive, and the #-namespace convention
&gt;can be iterated; so for example if the ontology called arithmetic at
&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic">http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic</A> contains an importing expression
&gt;'(imports it <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations">http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations</A>)'
&gt;
&gt;and the relation name 'succ' is used in the 'iterations'ontology, then this
&gt;relation may be referred to by the name 'it#succ' in arithmetic, and by the
&gt;name 'ar#it#succ' in any ontology which imports it with the local name 'ar',
&gt;ie which contains the expression
&gt;
&gt;MW: I don't understand why you would do this. It means that the same
&gt;ontology referred to from different places would have a different name path.
&gt;On the other hand, its own local name would be unchanged. Therefore this
&gt;seems both unnecessary and potentially confusing.

Some device is needed for ensuring that accidental namespace clashes 
do not occur. This is the scheme that has been devised by the W3C for 
web use to guarantee against such name clashes. It is awkward at 
times, but seems to be workable.

&gt;MW: The reason for putting namespaces into a namespace would be to be sure
&gt;you were talking about the same ontology with that name, e.g.
&gt;ISOTC184/SC4#4D-ontology#individual.
&gt;
&gt;(imports ar <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic">http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic</A>).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If an ontology at a URL includes another ontology , the included ontology
&gt;can be imported by using the #-prefix to refer to the included ontology. For
&gt;example, if the ontology at <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations">http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations</A> includes an
&gt;ontology form
&gt;
&gt;(ontology sequences ...)
&gt;
&gt;then the expression
&gt;
&gt;(imports seq <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations#sequences">http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations#sequences</A>)
&gt;
&gt;will import just the sentences from the sequences ontology form, with the
&gt;prefix seq# added to all the words in that namespace.
&gt;
&gt;MW: I'm trying to think when you would want to do this, and failing. It
&gt;strikes me as dangerous to import part of an ontology,

It would not apply to arbitrary parts of an ontology, only those that 
had been named as ontologies in an ontology form. It provides a 
simple way to allow sharing of content while ensuring against 
accidental name-coincidences producing unwanted results.

&gt; and then extend it in
&gt;some direction, providing an ideal mechanism for creating extended subsets
&gt;of something. If the pieces  really stand alone, then they should have been
&gt;developed like that, and if not ...

That view seems to me to be too limited (and even simplistic). We 
cannot possibly legislate how the entire world is going to use 
ontologies. The more part/whole structure is made explicit, the more 
likely the parts are to be reusable (and reused).

&gt;
&gt;The KIF expression
&gt;
&gt;(imports foo &lt;URI&gt;) ....
&gt;
&gt;corresponds to the following fragment of DAML+OIL:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:foo="&lt;URI&gt;#" &gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;daml:Ontology rdf:about=""&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;daml:imports resource="&lt;URI&gt;" /&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/daml:Ontology&gt;
&gt;
&gt;....
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&gt;
&gt;MW: Well, I guess I think there is some more to do here. I have a slight
&gt;sense here, of solutions without clear requirements. Clearly, the general
&gt;objective is to allow some sort of modularisation, and not to force things
&gt;to be monolithic. But for example, why are namespaces tied to
&gt;import/include? Why can't they be managed separately? I think two things
&gt;have got mixed up, naming issues, and modularisation issues.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Consider an alternative approach where you simply had for a module to
&gt;declare a default namespace.

Default for who? There is no such thing as a globally default 
namespace. But more seriously, I don't like the idea of defaults in 
this context: I would prefer that all importing, including, and so on 
be done as clearly and explicitly as possible.

&gt; Now there is really no difference between
&gt;import and include. Include would just be where the same namespace was used
&gt;in the imported module, and import is just where the imported module had a
&gt;different namespace.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Personally I think it would be good to keep structuring and naming
&gt;separate.

I dont think they can be kept separate. If we allow people to import 
modules then we need some convention for keeping namespaces separated 
from each other, or the entire system will be unworkable. And if we 
don't do any importing or sharing, then namespaces are not an issue.
