<PRE>

John Velman, (and other SUOers)
I have attempted to give my understanding in commentary to this.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the efforts at putting together this draft.  It is very useful,
&gt; and clear enough that I was able to isolate things I didn't understand,
&gt; and, perhaps, start to understand them.  I have a few comments, and a
&gt; paraphrase of some of it, based on my attempts to sort some things out that
&gt; weren't clear to me.  Others have made similar comments in some cases.
&gt; There is so much mail on this, that I can't attribute everything to its
&gt; originator.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Reference numbers, and KIF global syntax.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears that there is a global syntax convention that (discussion "xxx")
&gt; preceeds the actual axiom, theorem, or definition that is being discussed.
&gt; Can we count on this?  (If this is docmumented, I missed it.)  If so, this
&gt; might be a good place to start putting in reference identifiers of some
&gt; kind.  Of course, putting reference identifiers on material that is in an
&gt; early stage of development has a lot of problems, but it certainly would
&gt; facilitate discussion.

I think you are talking about the ;; comments that appear axioms.
I agree that we need to put reference identifiers into discussion
documents.  What do you think of the method I used in
<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01016.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01016.html</A> ?
ie:
R001:
(forall (?ANY) 
    (= ?ANY ?ANY))

&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Time.  I understand that, at this level, this ontology is supposed to
&gt; be time neutral (3d 4d).  Some people may have a problem with this;  on the other
&gt; hand, I agree with the approach of keeping things time and space neutral at
&gt; this level.  But it is hard to think this way.

I think it would be impossible to to be time-neutral.
It does make sense to talk about axioms that exist for all-time, (ie:
eternal, unchanging) or axioms that don't mention time.  I'm just convinced
that time is something that you can't be agnostic/neutral about.
There is an interaction with time whether you like it or not.
At best we define 'base assumptions' that specify a default for what that
interaction will bee with our axioms.
 
&gt; 3. Some confusion results from the order in which things are presented, and
&gt; lack of clear statements as to what is primative.   Some things that are
&gt; stated as axioms or theorems seem to either be or need definitions.
&gt; Perhaps they are there but I haven't found them.  The theorem on unions of
&gt; classes struck me as lacking a definition of union -- but I found it
&gt; later on.   I'm still looking for the definition of 'empty.'

I agree this is a real issue to doing work solely with e-mail.
 
&gt; 4. There is a level of abstraction (or something!) here that I had trouble
&gt; with---not wrong, just confusing to the unwary.  Like Matthew, I was
&gt; stopped for a good long time over (class relation).   This may be clear to
&gt; those who have been thinking about ontology in a certain way for some time,
&gt; but some of us need help!  (I'm glad to see from the mail that I'm not the
&gt; only one.)

Do you think Chris has clarified this sufficiently ?
 
&gt; 5. Well, to help sort out whether or not I'm on the right track, here is a
&gt; paraphrase of some of the content.  Any corrections or objections
&gt; will be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll try to do some KIF, but ...
&gt; 
&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; ;;  Primatives
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  The language includes (in addition to the bare KIF syntax)
&gt; ;;  logical connectives, and the following primatives:
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  relation
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  instance-of
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  particular
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  -- I've thrown in the term 'particular' since particulars seem to be
&gt; ;;  lurking
&gt; ;;  in the background.  I'm not sure this is essential at this stage, but
&gt; ;;  I'm more comfortable including them.

Just as long as you realize that some of us have no idea what a particular
might be. (I personally think that they are similar to instances of a class)


&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  Well formed expressions --
&gt; ;;  We need to know that if (relation ?rel) then (?rel @args) is well
&gt; ;; formed if and only if @args has one or more entries.  I don't know how
&gt; ;; to do this, so having noted it, I'm going to gloss over it.

I included axioms in my structural ontology specifically to define
what well-formed means. The naive approach of simply stating 
(=&gt; (relation ?rel) (?rel ?arg))  (for the unary case) has the 
disadvantage that it could be interpreted as saying that all relations
must have at least one extension.

&gt; 
&gt; (documentation "Axiom: only relations can be truly predicated of other
&gt; things")
&gt; (forall (?r @args)
&gt;      (=&gt; (?r @args)
&gt;          (relation  ?r)))

What does it mean for a relation to be falsely predicated of other things?
Also, as I read this, it says that if you have an extension you must have
the first element satisfying the unary-relation 'relation'.  Is that what
you meant to say?

You do recall that you can have a function whose result is a relation, right?
 
&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  instance-of is an instance of relation")
&gt; (instance-of instance-of relation)
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  particular is an instance of relation")
&gt; (instance-of particular relation)
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  relation is an instance of  relation")
&gt; (instance-of relation relation)
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Everything is either a relation or a particular")
&gt; 
&gt; (forall (?x) (or ((relation ?x) (particular ?x))

The KIF says inclusive or
But your comment implies exclusive or. Assuming the comment is your intent,
I'm uncomfortable with this. are you saying that (particular instance-of)
is false? but you earlier said instance-of  specifically is an instance of
the class 'relation'.  I'm confused.
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Nothing is both a relation and a particular")
&gt; 
&gt; (forall (?x) (not
&gt;                (and (relation ?x)  (particular ?x))))
&gt; 
My comment applies here too.

&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; ;;  It is unclear to me why unary and binary were given as AXIOMS rather
&gt; ;;  than as DEFINITIONS.   It seems to me they should be defined.
&gt; ;;  Alternatively, one makes these primative terms, and then gives AXIOMS.
&gt; ;;  BUt why not just define them?

Other than the fact that KIF has no way of stating a mathematical/logical
definition ?  (it only defines terms, axioms and rules between them.)

&gt; ;;  In either case, at this point in the development we can
&gt; ;;  go from here to a definiton (or axiomatization?) of arity of relations,
&gt; ;;  and the other definitions and theorems in the section on BASIC RELATION
&gt; ;;  THEORY  (except, of course, those that refer to classes).
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;   I think the following are axioms:
&gt; (documentation "AXIOM  relation is a unary relation")
&gt; (unary relation)
&gt; 
I agree.

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM  particular is a unary relation")
&gt; (unary particular)

Maybe, but I don't know what you mean by particular.

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM instance-of is a binary relation")
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;   Assuming that has been done:
&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;
&gt; 
&gt; (documentation "DEFINITION:  empty.  A relation is empty if it has no
&gt; instances")
&gt; 
&gt; (forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
&gt;      (&lt;=&gt; (empty ?rel)
&gt;           (not (exists (@args) (?rel @args)))))
&gt; 
What is the difference between a relation being empty and a relation having
no extension, and a relation having an extension that is empty?

&gt; (documentation "DEFINITION:  A class is a unary relation")
&gt; 
&gt; (forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
&gt;      (&lt;=&gt; (class ?rel) (unary ?rel) ) )
&gt; 

I'm not sure about this.
However, I expect that even when all relations that are unary are also 
classes, that the fact that they may have different extensions won't make
'unary' a synonym for 'class'.

&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; 
&gt; Now the material on classes is largely covered by the material on
&gt; relations.  Of course subclasses can be introduced.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope I'm on more or less the right track.
&gt; 
&gt; I heartily recommend trying to write some KIF as an aid to
&gt; learning the language.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt; 
&gt; John Velman
&gt; 

I agree.
David
