Graham and Pat,

To avoid endless problems caused by mismatched definitions,
I suggest that we adopt the following equivalences between
terms:

1.  The terms "relation" and "relationship" in ordinary
    English have multiple meanings.  But the use in both
    symbolic logic and in relational databases is firmly
    established.  I recommend that we restrict all uses
    of those two words to the meanings in logic and RDBMS.

2.  In RDB, a relation is defined by a table.  The number
    of columns in the table is critical:  a binary or dyadic
    relation has two columns, a ternary or triadic relation
    has three columns, etc.  Each row of the table is
    called a tuple or a relationship.

3.  In ordinary language, a relationship (row of a table)
    normally relates two or more entities.  But for generality,
    it is convenient to allow tables with just one column.
    To avoid saying that a one-column table defines a relation,
    some people prefer to call them properties or attributes.

4.  In logic, the terms predicate and relation are normally
    used as synonyms.  For those people who feel uneasy about
    calling a one-column table a relation, one could say that
    it defines a monadic or unary predicate.  Then the term
    predicate can be used to represent tables with 1 or more
    columns.

5.  The terms property and attribute tend to get very confusing
    and people keep arguing about whether attributes are entities.
    To avoid such arguments, it is best to use a single word such
    as predicate, with an additional adjective to specify the number
    of arguments:  monadic, dyadic, triadic, or n-adic, if you count
    in Greek;  or unary, binary, ternary, or n-ary, if you count
    in Latin.

Many people have different preferences in their use of terminology,
and I don't want to limit anybody's stylistic preferences.  But
for ease of communication, I would recommend that we use the
word "predicate" with a qualifier to specify the number of
arguments as the base term.  To visualize the values of
a predicate, you can think of it as a table in an RDBMS
(but with the option of having infinitely many rows,
in the case of predicates defined over the integers
or even the real numbers).

The words "property" and "attribute" have been used in many confusing ways.
I suggest that we use them only as synonyms for monadic (or unary) predicate.

Re:  RELATION and RELATIONSHIP

I like the definitions proposed by John, which in summary are:

RELATION:      a set of tuples; corresponds to a predicate

RELATIONSHIP:  a single tuple, a member of a relation.

Matthew &amp; All,

 "Matthew"  is a sign that denotes Matthew   (in the real world).
 "x"        is a sign that denotes x         (in the real world).
 "&lt;x, y&gt;"   is a sign that denotes &lt;x, y&gt;    (in the real world).
 "R"        is a sign that denotes {&lt;x, y&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; in R} (ITRW).
'"Matthew"' is a sign that denotes "Matthew" (in the real world).
'"x"'       is a sign that denotes "x"       (in the real world).
'"&lt;x, y&gt;"'  is a sign that denotes "&lt;x, y&gt;"  (in the real world).
'"R"'       is a sign that denotes "R"       (in the real world).

There's a pattern here.

Dear Matthew,

I do [not] want to be taken as trying to zing you on account of some zing
that somebody else did to me  -- I always really hate it, myself,
when somebody does that to me -- but what you said merely went
to remind me of a rather old and tiresome problem, one that
I wish that we all could get past, and I feel like I have
already contributed my darnedest bit of yarn to trying
to untangle it -- all to such little aveil, alas! --
and perhaps the antic frustrations of not being
able to rend this "antic issue" (AI) a toile
that would one day be of the "said &amp; done"
variety and all of the kindred ambivalent
"sanguinity" bled through just a bit into
bloody irony, but I simply wish that we
could see through it all -- I tried to
give the Inquistive my scope on the
objects of our earnest attention,
but none are so blinkered by the
orbs of their vision as those
who tremble before imaginary
daimons, the ones that they
imagine inhabit the scopes,
never seeing 'tis the eyes
that habit what they see.

But let me try to focus on what you say now:

I do not think that I would call it "quite common to see",
and although I believe that I may have run across a few
expressions that appear, from a certain angle, distance,
or perspective to look roughly or superfically similar
to these, I tend to suspect that the people who write
them -- I cannot guarantee that it was not me, too! --
are just being careless, or casual, or loose in their
canon, that probably they meant to write something else,
and that the job of reflection on expressions is to help
them -- or help myself, as the case may be! -- to untangle
their sense and, as Bobby Burns say, "to mend their ways".

I can talk till I am truly "blue of face" (BOF), but, without the purple

I can think that I see a way to untangle this --

&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  No, all we can do (and perhaps should do)

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes   a   in the real world
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you give me a concrete example -- I still cannot think of one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here, just to try and speed things up, I can think of an example
&gt; &gt; where I was almost tempted to say something just a bit like this.
&gt; &gt; Let me remind you of the story that I told about A and B, where
&gt; &gt; each of these two "objects" in the real world -- well, alright,
&gt; &gt; my imaginary real world, but you know what I mean -- is also
&gt; &gt; an "interpreter" of certain signs, and so is associated with
&gt; &gt; a sign relation, portions of which I set down as follows,
&gt; &gt; under the names "R(A)" and "R(B)", respectively:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | You can start out by imagining that two people,
&gt; &gt; | A and B, have a language that is restricted to
&gt; &gt; | just their own proper names, "A" and "B", plus the
&gt; &gt; | first and second person pronouns, "I" and "you",
&gt; &gt; | which will here be| schematized as "i" and "u",
&gt; &gt; | respectively.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | To specify a sign relation one has to give three domains,
&gt; &gt; | the Object, Sign, and Interpretant domains, schematized
&gt; &gt; | here as O, S, and I, respectively.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | For this example, let us consider the two sign relations,
&gt; &gt; | R(A) and R(B), corresponding to the usages of the two
&gt; &gt; | "interpreters", A and B, respectively.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | [ *** Note On New Notation ***
&gt; &gt; | |
&gt; &gt; | | I will use "in" for "element of" and "ç" for "subset of".
&gt; &gt; | ]
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | We have the following:
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | R(A), R(B)  ç  O x S x I,
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | O  =  {A, B},
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | S  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"},
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | I  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"}.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | R(A) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "i", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "u", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | R(B) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "u", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "i", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Following a usage of C.S. Peirce,
&gt; &gt; | the elements of a sign relation R, that is,
&gt; &gt; | the ordered triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; in R,
&gt; &gt; | are known as its "elementary sign relations".
&gt; &gt; | (This is roughly Peirce's meaning.)
&gt; &gt; |

&gt; &gt; | ]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, it is very tempting to just go ahead and identify
&gt; &gt; the "objective interpreters" A and B with the portions
&gt; &gt; of sign relations that are indicated in an immediately
&gt; &gt; relevant context, and thus to write out the identities,
&gt; &gt; A = R(A) and B = R(B), or, to write it all out in full:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A  =  {&lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "A", "i"&gt;, &lt;A, "i", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "i", "i"&gt;,
&gt; &gt;        &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "B", "u"&gt;, &lt;B, "u", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "u", "u"&gt;}.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; B  =  {&lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "A", "u"&gt;, &lt;A, "u", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "u", "u"&gt;,
&gt; &gt;        &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "B", "i"&gt;, &lt;B, "i", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "i", "i"&gt;}.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, we are treading on recursed ground here, or very nearly,
&gt; &gt; apparently defining A and B in terms of themselves, in a way
&gt; &gt; that would seem to lead to an infinite regress, so it seems.
&gt; &gt; Now, the situation is really not as bad as all that, not if
&gt; &gt; one is careful, and qualifies everything with due attention,
&gt; &gt; but still, it is probably a good idea to avoid this way of
&gt; &gt; expressing things if at all possible.  One way to stay out
&gt; &gt; of trouble and confusion is to maintain the distinctions
&gt; &gt; between A and R(A) and between B and R(B), respectfully.
&gt; &gt; Another way to do it is to "hedge the equal signs" that
&gt; &gt; appear just above, stipulating that they do not signify
&gt; &gt; literal identities but only mark relationships whereby
&gt; &gt; the ostensible definienda A and B are "represented by"
&gt; &gt; their "actions" on the surrogate definientia, that is,
&gt; &gt; the basic elements {A, B, "A", "B", "i", "u"} that go
&gt; &gt; to make up the triples, that go to make up the sets
&gt; &gt; of triples, that are the sign relations in question.
&gt;
&gt; MW: let me try something "real"
&gt;
&gt; &lt;purchase, Carter's, lawnmower, Honda CB250,
&gt;  GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;

Well, I will not quibble, for now, about the "locus of reality" (LOR),
and which of our instances is nearer to it, but I am pretty sure that
you and I will have many myriads more occasions to use sign relations
that are isomorphic to those in the Story of A and B before we happen
next to think on the purchase of a new lawnmower -- at least it shall
fall out that way in my particular Nex Of Web, my clime of world, and
my time of the year -- but never mind all that now, back to your tale.

&gt; This is reasonably typical of what
&gt; you might find in a purchasing system.

Now, here -- here, now -- I find that I must quibble.
For what you say is what I understand well enough if
I grant you the grace of a poetic license (licence?),
but since we are striving to be just as picky in our
reading of the letter of the lore as we possibly can,
since we are straining to watch our P's and Q's even
as the moving finger sets them out in blackened writ,
well, then we must look to see if we can see what it
is that is really going on here, anyway, in, and for,
and all around and about the neighborhood of the new
transaction to which your currency is adverting here,
the one that lies behind, beneath, beyond all of our
many fine, but not so final signs.

So let us 'really' try to think about what is 'really' going on
in the database system, keeping mostly to the superficial level
of the software system, but not staying altogether oblivious to
what is going in the physical system that embodies the computer,
roughly analogous, if only through the sequence of by and large
historical accidents that we e-phemize as "incre-mental design",
to that species of biological system -- I did say "roughly"! --
that makes up our minds, so far as we know.

Let us say that you load up and initialize your favorite relational
database system -- I've got mine ready to go! -- and then you enter
the following sequence of signs into a relational database table of
the appropriate number of columns, breaking up the string as you go,
and parceling them out to the waiting table in the accustomary ways.

Here's the String, or a Token thereof:

"&lt;purchase, Carter's, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;"

Here's the Table, or an Image thereof:

I think that you may need to re-set the line length on your browser,
or this discussion will quickly descend into utterly unscansionable
chaos!  I will break for coffee and give you a while to do that ...

And besides, I have to go rummaging through my Attic
to see if I can locate my "Old Naive Realists'" hat --
yes, it's so old that it's really a helmet!  BaDaBoom!

By the way, my allusions to "going for the record"
were meant as a joke, not as a challenge! --
you appear to trying to catch up!
Give it up!

Cheers,

If Not Always From The Stands,

Now, at long last, after this extended moment of reflection,
I think that I am ready to begin dealing with the remainder:

&gt; MW: let me try something "real"

&gt;
&gt; This is reasonably typical of what
&gt; you might find in a purchasing system.
&gt;
&gt; It might be said to represent a purchasing activity.

Bene; I think that I know what you are getting at here,
but in order for me to understand you in the form that
I think that I must, it will be necessity, as a matter
of praxis, for me to invoke, not just my simple-minded
faith in logical reasoning, but my hope that there can
be, in good time, a "Rule Of Inquiry" (ROI) that shall
overcome the legion of adversities that we find at the
moment so dead-set against it, and, last but not least,
to assemble the admittedly meagre resources of charity
that I have in my command for the sake of interpreting
the sequence of signs that you have just now passed on
to me, all in all calling on All Three Of These Graces
in order to "Supplement the Shortcoming of the Senses".

Accordingly, to make a long story short,
I will take you to mean that the string:

"&lt;purchase, Carter's, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;"

is that which you want to say "might be said to represent a purchasing activity".

But probably I ought to stop just here,
never to rush in where the Anglish has
no tread, no traction, no tractability,
and ask you if this is what you intend?

And for once I will be cautious,
and for now I will do just that!

Until Later,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; However, you will note that there is no single element
&gt; in this tuple that represents that activity, only the
&gt; class of activity (purchase).  Similarly, there is no
&gt; object that is a surrogate for the actual lawnmower
&gt; purchased (e.g. its serial number), but only the type
&gt; of item bought (lawnmower) and the manufacturers model
&gt; (Honda CB250) and even this has the manufacturers name
&gt; bundled in.  Since this is an international lawnmower
&gt; shop, they have unusually given a unit of measure for
&gt; the price paid, and we have the date and time of the
&gt; purchase.  It is highly likely that there is only one
&gt; activity that all these elements relate to.  But the
&gt; question is, does this refer to an activity, or is it
&gt; just a relation of elements that are each related to
&gt; an activity and together uniquely identify it, but
&gt; is not a surrogate for the activity itself?  I would
&gt; argue that it is the latter, but custom and practice
&gt; means that many would accept it as the former.
