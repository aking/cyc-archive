&gt; Subject: Re: SUO: Vote on Merged Ontology as a 'Base Document' for SUO
&gt; WG
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I vote NO
&gt; 
&gt; Nothwithstanding some of the rather ad-hominem attacks about 
&gt; this matter, I
&gt; feel 
&gt; that I must also vote no on this question. Below are some of 
&gt; my reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Without following all of Pat's arguments, I agree with the 
&gt; gist of them.
&gt; 

I agree that Pat Hayes offered many substantive criticisms of the first
draft of the merged ontology that I circulated.  In the second draft, I
attempted to accomodate many of these criticisms.  I am sure that Pat Hayes
still has plenty of objections to this document, but we're heading in the
right direction, I think.

&gt; 2. Ignoring the logical foundations, the engineering issues 
&gt; do not come
&gt; close to 
&gt; being resolved either. By this I mean primarily the issues of 
&gt; scale and 
&gt; componentization. A document that is already &gt;1000 lines 
&gt; long, which is not 
&gt; properly structured with well defined interfaces is simply 
&gt; not going to
&gt; survive 
&gt; when we need 100K lines.
&gt; 

I agree that a text editor is not the optimal way of viewing ontological
content, especially when there is a lot of such content.  However, I do
think that the merged ontology, as it stands, is componentialized - it
contains approximately a dozen sections (and some sections contain
subsections).  If you want just the highest level content for a particular
application, you can restrict yourself to the sections entitled "Structural
Ontology" and "General Classes".

&gt; 3. The process by which an agreed specification arises does 
&gt; NOT need to
&gt; follow 
&gt; the route of a `piece of grit' from which oysters come; 
&gt; otherwise known as 
&gt; `programming by debugging the null program'. There are alternatives.
&gt; To quote some techniques that I have used:
&gt;   1. develop use case scenarios
&gt;   2. develop and focus on key abstractions; to be followed by 
&gt; a reification
&gt; later
&gt;   3. brainstorm + gradual crystalization of consensus.

Well, as I see it, we are incorporating these three other techniques in the
current process.  The "Scope and Purpose Statement" for the SUO project
includes three general applications of the envisioned ontology, and these
applications have informed my development of the merged ontology.  As for
focusing on key abstractions, the merged ontology is the product of fusing
many of the ontologies listed on the "Candidate Content" page (linked to the
SUO page), and each of these ontologies contains its own set of "key
abstractions".  Thus, I think that a large range of "key abstractions"
already appear in the merged ontology.  Those that don't can, I think, be
incorporated later as elaboration of the merged ontology proceeds.  Although
the third technique was not used to develop the merged ontology, it is, I
think, absolutely essential to refining and extending it.    

&gt; 
&gt; 4. At this time I would argue for (a) more concern about 
&gt; engineering issues,
&gt; (b) 
&gt; less focus on the concrete and more on the key abstractions.  
&gt; (This is NOT a
&gt; 
&gt; contradiction)

I think (a.) is a good criticism of the merged ontology.  It paid too much
attention to philosophical niceties (and, thus, controversies) and was not
clearly focused on the engineering orientation which is required if the
ontology is ever going to be used in designing real information systems.  I
have since tried to purge the ontology of extraneous philosophical material,
while endeavoring to maintain its precision and theoretical soundness.  I'll
send out the revised draft sometime next week.

&gt; 
&gt; However, it is clear that direction is sorely needed: we dont 
&gt; have time for 
&gt; another 3K years of philosophical debate.

I agree.
