&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; The metalevel terms about language are seldom, if ever, used
&gt; in precise ways.  The word "word" is commonly used to refer to
&gt; a word type or an instance of a word type.  The same is true
&gt; of "sentence", "character string", "number", etc.  In logic
&gt; and computer science, the distinction is sometimes important,
&gt; and qualifiers, such as "type" or "instance", can be added
&gt; to the terms.  But more often than not, there is no need to
&gt; add qualifiers, since the interpretation is "obvious".

Well, I was with you until you said the word "obvious", since we have
obviously spent a whole lot of time in discussions, here and elsewhere,
where there were manifold different notions of what ought to be obvious.
In any case, there is no way to get started on a pragmatic study of how
sign relations work -- speculatively (might work), descriptively (do work),
or normatively (should work) -- without beginning to get a lot more careful
about what roles, O, S, I, each thing is playing at a given moment.  Just
asking onself, "Now, what column of the sign-relation table am I going to
put this darn thing in, anyway?" is a big start on the problem.

Of course, one can create a continuum along the token-type dimension
if one wants to do that, but usually we just need to say where in
the definition of the sign relation a given thing fits at a given
moment of a semiotic process.  I have lost some usage battles here,
but also won a couple -- one of the reasons that I gave up using
"proposition" for the sign-thing is because most computer science
folks are used to the paradigm that goes on uniformly like this:

A constant-name is the name of a constant,
A function-name is the name of a function,
A procedure-name is the name of a procedure,
A variable-name is the name of a variable,
And so on ...

So if I say that a proposition-expression is the expression of a proposition,
and then later on slip in the def that a sentence is a proposition-expression,
that seems to get me through without too much hassle ... 

&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that Peirce says "every true Proposition" -- a phrase
&gt; &gt; &gt; which is consistent with the assumption that there exist
&gt; &gt; &gt; more than one true proposition, even infinitely many.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, but here he is using the word "proposition" in a way
&gt; &gt; that we no longer do, to mean the actual sign or sentence.
&gt; &gt; Anyway, that is the way that I have to interpret his usage,
&gt; &gt; considering this standard portion of his sign classification:
&gt; 
&gt; As I said, Kimosabe, I don't see any need to interpret
&gt; his terms as being limited to the actual expression as
&gt; uttered:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; | Sign
&gt; &gt; |    Index
&gt; &gt; |    Icon
&gt; &gt; |    Symbol
&gt; &gt; |       Term
&gt; &gt; |       Proposition
&gt; &gt; |       Argument
&gt; &gt; |          Deduction
&gt; &gt; |          Induction
&gt; &gt; |          Abduction
&gt; 
&gt; I interpret these terms as general types.
&gt; I (and I believe Peirce) would talk about
&gt; Plato's argument in the Sophist without
&gt; making a distinction about the original
&gt; Greek or an English translation, unless
&gt; for some reason, the particular word in
&gt; the text was being discussed explicitly.

Oh, I see --
No, I think we are now speaking othogonal to each other.
It is not the token-type or the instance-object-property
dimension that I am talking about here, but the object-sign
distinction.  I conventionally (my convention) think of the
first as a vertical dimension and the second as a horizontal
dimension, typically drawing pictures like this:

|                   . . .
|                    \|/
|               s=====s
|    q q q     /     /|\
|     \|/     /     . . .
|      o-----@
|     /|\     \     . . .
|    e e e     \     \|/
|               i=====i
|                    /|\
|                   . . .

This illustrates an "elementary sign relation" &lt;o, s, i&gt;, just a 3-tuple,
with "exemplars" (instances, tokens) and "qualities" (properties, types)
of each.  So the object has its place in one or many object hierarchies,
so does the sign, and so does the interpretant of the moment.  Then you
need more signs to denote the object exemplars and the object qualities,
and so it goes.  The stuff on the object side accumulates in what I like
to call an "objective framework" (OF), while the stuff on the sign side
yields an "interpretive framework" (IF).
 
&gt; &gt; Believe me, I tried to continue this usage as long as I could,
&gt; &gt; but finally had to give it up because I encountered too many
&gt; &gt; rather insistent authorities who insisted on using either one
&gt; &gt; or both of the words "proposition" and "statement" -- please
&gt; &gt; don't ask me why, but they do! -- to mean either one or all
&gt; &gt; of these things:  (1) the abstract, formal, logical object
&gt; &gt; that is denoted by the now-called "propositional expression"
&gt; &gt; or "sentence", or (2) the equivalence class of sentences that
&gt; &gt; serves as a stand-in for those dispositions of thinkers who do
&gt; &gt; not wish to acknowledge the existence of anything falling under
&gt; &gt; the description of ostensibly "abstract objects" and their ilk.
&gt; &gt; So I gave it up and now use the term "expression" or "sentence".
&gt; 
&gt; That is why I gave a formal definition of "proposition" and
&gt; use it consistently to mean the intension of a sentence type,
&gt; which I represent by an equivalence class of sentence types
&gt; that all have the same intension.

I think that this must be one of those places where
this "orthogonality" is causing confusion betwen us.
I am very accustomed to saying that a proposition
is an equivalence class of sentences, but that is
the standard way that I reconstitute the structure
of the object domain over the syntactic domain of
any sign relation, as I did in the Ann &amp; Bob example.
But when the signs are sentences, then the objects are
what those sentences denote, that is, a theorem denotes
"The Truth" as an object, and so on.  So the equivalence
classes of sentences that reconstitute the structure of
the object domain are just logical equivalence classes.
Of course, a given interpreter can impose any partition
of signs that comes to mind, but the partition of signs
that corresponds to the partition of objects is just
the partition into LEC's.  This is all independent
of any token-type distinctions.  A sign is still
a sign of an object, as types &amp;r tokens go by,
that is, whether sign or object be taken in
general or in particular.

&gt; &gt; Let's not worry about empirical statements just yet,
&gt; &gt; as it seems like a good idea to try to get clear on
&gt; &gt; purely logical statements before tackling the world.
&gt; 
&gt; For the remainder of your discussion, you are defining a
&gt; particular kind of transformation.  But the end result
&gt; seems to be more naturally described as a "truth value",
&gt; not a "proposition".  That seems to be a very unnatural usage,
&gt; and I have never come across anyone else who uses it.  To avoid
&gt; confusing people, I suggest that you adopt the term "truth value"
&gt; for what you seem to be calling a proposition.

Not sure.

A truth value is just an element of B, treated as a logical value.

A propositional expression (a sign thing) is the expression of
a proposition (an abstract or formal object), which by itself
gets its abstract or formal meaning by being subject to the
classical laws of logic, or some other axiom system, but
since I am a concrete-minded person I constantly check
its putative properties against one or another simple
sorts of standard models, for example, functions of
concrete type X -&gt; B, or of abstract type B^k -&gt; B,
for a suitable X or k, or the corresponding shapes
of geometric regions in some universe of discourse
to whose detail within cells we remain indifferent.
In short, the sentence denotes a proposition that
can be interpreted as a function of type B^k -&gt; B,
but the rangey B at the end is not the B all end all,
and it is certainly not the denotation of the sentence.

&gt; Bottom line:  I am happy with my definition, which
&gt; I believe corresponds to the traditional usage, the
&gt; modern usage, and Peirce's usage (as far as I can tell).

I think that this would bear further examination.
