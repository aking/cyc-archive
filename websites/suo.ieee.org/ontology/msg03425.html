JA = Jon Awbrey
JM = Jean-Marc Orliaguet

JA: I distinquish between &quot;expectation&quot; and &quot;hope&quot;.
    Expectation is based on and projected forward
    from previous experience.  Hope is the common
    nomen for a regulative principle, the springs
    of whose fountains a moment's or a lifetime's
    reflection will tell us that we eternally had
    in our hearts despite our never suspecting it.

JM: What you call 'expectation' Peirce calls it 'memory',
    what you call 'hope', Peirce calls it 'expectation',
    since a 'projected experience' in itself has no
    generality:

I have explained to you, very roughly, how I currently use these words.
You must understand that I never took any vow to conform to Peirce's
or any other usage, though I do try the best that I can to strike
compromises among the claims of the many different languages,
whether casual, formal, poetic, technical, whatever, that
I find it useful to use.  I always come to Peirce the
same way that I do to any other thinker, ancient or
modern, and that is due to some current question
that I cannot answer for myself, that forces
me to track-back to some assumption that
I may, warily or not, have been taking
for granted.  In the case of Peirce,
I find him standing at one of those
forks in the road, trivium trifurca,
where a remarkable number of our
belightened age's unsodden paths
happen to branch off, and just
as suddenly appear broken off,
in all conceivable directions,
remaining as yet unexplored
and unminded to this day.
Let's go there.

Still, all in all, I do not agree with your interpretations of Peirce
in the matter of the relationships among actuality, expectation, fact,
generality, hope, memory, percept, project, sensation, and on, and on.

JM, citing CSP:

    | This percept is a single event happening hic et nunc.
    | It cannot be generalized without losing its essential
    | character.  For it is an actual passage at arms between
    | the non-ego and the ego.  A blow is passed, so to say.
    | Generalize the fact that you get hit in the eye, and all
    | that distinguishes the actual fact, the shock, the pain,
    | the inflammation, is gone.  It is anti-general.  The memory
    | preserves this character, only slightly modified.  The actual
    | shock, etc., are no longer there, the quality of the event has
    | associated itself in the mind with similar past experiences.
    | It is a little generalized in the perceptual fact.  Still,
    | it is referred to a special and unique occasion, and the
    | flavor of anti-generality is the predominant one.  Now,
    | on the other hand, consider what an expectation is.
    |
    | Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 2.146

This says what Peirce thinks a percept is.
In the surrounding text about expectation
Peirce pretty much takes it for granted
that reader already knows how go about
expecting something, and merely calls
to mind various sights along the way.

JA: Expectation is not exactly a habit, though we do have habits of expectation.
    In its logical form an expectation is expressible by means of a proposition,
    so it may be treated as a proposition affected by a modality or an attitude.

JM: I refer also to CP 2.148.

    | An expectation is a habit of imagining.  A habit is not
    | an affection of consciousness;  it is a general law of
    | action, such that on a certain general kind of occasion
    | a man will be more or less apt to act in a certain general
    | way.  An imagination is an affection of consciousness which
    | can be directly compared with a percept in some special feature,
    | and be pronounced to accord or disaccord with it.  Suppose for
    | example that I slip a cent into a slot, and expect on pulling
    | a knob to see a little cake of chocolate appear.  My expectation
    | consists in, or at least involves, such a habit that when I think
    | of pulling the knob, I imagine I see a chocolate coming into view.
    | When the perceptual chocolate comes into view, my imagination of it
    | is a feeling of such a nature that the percept can be compared with
    | it as to size, shape, the nature of the wrapper, the color, taste,
    | flavor, hardness and grain of what is within.  Of course, every
    | expectation is a matter of inference.  (CP 2.148).

These are all paragraphs that have ruled pencil lines next to them
in my copy of CP.  The memory is a bit vague -- or is it general,
I forget -- but I do know that I expended quite a bit of time
and energy reconciling the views of several thinkers on this
very subject, Peirce's lights here and Freud's insights from
the &quot;Project&quot; of 1895 being the two greatest influences on me.

The reason that I wrote &quot;expectation is not exactly a habit&quot; is exactly
because I did not expect or imagine that the typical reader would think
of a &quot;habit of imagining&quot; among the first things that come to mind here.

JM: But what inference?  rather induction than deduction ...

JM, citing CSP:

    | Induction is that mode of reasoning which adopts
    | a conclusion as approximate, because it results
    | from a method of inference which must generally
    | lead to the truth in the long run.  (CP 1.67).

JA: I think that you will find that expectations are generated in the fashion
    of deductions.  Unconscious deduction?  That is what makes people tend to
    react more reflexively than reflectively to the unherd of idea.  One must
    understand, of course, that when we build logical models of psychological
    processes that these are what are known as &quot;rational reconstructions&quot;, or
    maybe &quot;reconstructions within the circus of reason alone&quot; is more precise.
    Their job requirement is to emulate, up to informational equivalence, the
    form or the gist of what might have happened in reality, no more, no less.

JM, citing CSP:

    | Begin with something in the distant future;
    | and dismiss from your mind mechanical and
    | necessitarian ideas, which essentially
    | modify the pure notion of futurity.
    | (CP 2.146).

He is talking about Laplace, not Freud.

JM: deduction is mechanical, it is necessary reasoning from premises,
    but expectation is not.

There are exact and approximate forms of everything.

JM: So maybe you mean that abduction &quot;mediates&quot; between
    induction and deduction?  not vice-versa?

Inquiry is a cyclic process.  Mediation is all.
Every phase mediates every other phase, if one
contemplates it in a voluminous enough context.

Any settlement of uncertainty, that is to say, any inquiry,
is likely to involve all three ductions in iterative style.
To say that &quot;expectations are generated in the fashion of
deductions&quot; is not to say that they are generated in only
that fashion.  This is exactly why I elaborated Peirce's
example of the Thricefold Wisdom as carefully as I did.
Being a Case, a Fact, a Rule is not an &quot;essence&quot; of
a proposition, but an &quot;accident&quot; of it, a &quot;role&quot;
that it has been cast to play in a particular
instance of argument.  Much like the thrown
roles of Object, Sign, Interpretant as
played in a particular sign relation,
as portrayed in that theorematic bit
of theatre that all the world knows
as the &quot;pragmatic theory of signs&quot;
(PTOS), I might add.
