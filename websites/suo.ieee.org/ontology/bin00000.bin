;; METALINGUISTIC STUFF

;; Definite descriptions

;; Definite descriptions are not currently part of KIF.  However, they
;; are used liberally in this ontology, so an axiom schema -- due
;; largely to Bertrand Russell -- has been introduced to capture its
;; meanings -- roughly, that an object ?x is the A iff A is in fact
;; true of ?x, anything that A is true of must be identical to ?x.

;; So, let WFF be a KIF sentence that contains a single free variable
;; X.  For any term TRM, let WFF[Y] be the result of replacing every
;; free occurrence of X in WFF with variable Y.  Then the following is
;; an axiom:
;;
;; (<=> (= X (the (X) WFF))
;;      (and WFF
;;           (forall (Y)
;;                   (=> WFF[Y]
;;                       (= X Y)))))

(documentation "This theory is divided into four main sections: \
\
(1) a preliminary ontological part, which introduces the basic binary relation is-a-hole-in (or -through), along with some relevant facts;\
\
(2) a mereological part, which systematizes some fundamental principles governing the interplay between the host-hole and the part-whole relations;\
\
(3) a topological part, which summarizes some basic facts concerning surfaces and the taxonomy of holes; and\
\
(4) a morphological part, focusing on the fact that objects with holes constitute - as we have put it - the morphological manifold of fillable things.\
\
This organization does not exactly parallel the order we followed in the text, where mereological facts were examined only after -- and somehow on the basis of -- a topo-morphological characterization of holes.  Indeed, the interplay among these different domains (as well as between these and other domains, such as kinematics or causality, considered in the text but not included here) is an interesting issue in itself, but it would take us too far afield to address it here. For the modest purposes of this theory, suffice it to note that the order followed here permits a rather nice and intuitively simple step-by-step construction.\
\
The exposition proceeds more geometrico. Each section begins with basic definitions, followed by some basic principles, or axioms, followed by a list of a few noteworthy consequences or theorems. (Numbers in braces indicate the axiom or definition from which a theorem is derived.) It is understood that there is no pretense of completeness or logical elegance. In fact we have been quite relaxed in our choice of axioms and theorems, as our aim is first and foremost perspicuity. An informal spelling of every formula, sometimes with a brief comment, is also provided. The reader may want to skip the formulas and just focus on these informal renderings.")

(documentation "The main thesis is that a hole is an immaterial body located at the surface (or at some surface) of a material object. Since the notion of a surface is essentially a topological one, and since the property of being immaterial is reflected in the morphological property of being fillable, the ontological basis is concerned first and foremost with the general dependence of a hole on its host.")

;; Primitive predicates
;;
;; 2-place: part-of

(documentation "This section of the theory introduces the 2-place 'part-of' relation.  It is one of many possible mereological primitives: a reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive relation (i.e., a partial ordering), according to classical mereology.")

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; MEREOLOGICAL DEFINITIONS ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; D2.1 (proper-part-of)

(documentation proper-part-of "?x is a proper part of ?y iff ?x is a part of ?y other than ?y itself. This is a transitive and asymmetric (hence irreflexive) relation.")

(forall (?x ?y)
	(<=> (proper-part ?x ?y)
	     (and (part-of ?x ?y)
		  (/= ?x ?y))))

;; D2.2 (overlaps)

(documentation overlaps "?x overlaps ?y iff ?x and ?y have some parts in common. This is a reflexive and symmetric (but not transitive) relation.")

	(<=> (overlaps ?x ?y)
	     (exists (?z)
		     (and (part-of ?z ?x)
			  (part-of ?z ?y)))))

;; D2.3 (fusion-of)

;; The definition of the notion of the fusion of all the things that
;; satisfy a certain condition in this ontology requires a
;; metalinguistic schema, and the expression of metalinguistic
;; information is not yet settled in KIF.  Informally, the fusion of
;; the objects that satisfy a given condition A is just the object
;; such that an object overlaps it if and only if it overlaps
;; something that satisfies A.  It is the metalinguistic variable `A'
;; here that makes this an essentially metalinguistic definition.
;; Fortunately, all definitions and axioms that make use of the fusion
;; operator can simply be cashed out explicitly case by case in the
;; manner expressed in the schematic definition.  Thus, instead of
;; referring to the fusion of all things satisfying a given condition
;; A, we simply talk directly of the object that is overlapped by all
;; and only objects that overlap something satisfying condition A.
;; Hence, while the fusion operator is convenient, is not necessary
;; for purposes here.

;; D2.4 (sum-of)

(documentation sum-of "The sum of ?x and ?y is the smallest thing whose parts are either parts of ?x or parts of ?y. This is an idempotent, commutative, distributive operation.")

(forall (?x ?y)

			  (exists (?u)
				  (and (or (part-of ?u ?x)
					   (part-of ?u ?y))
				       (overlaps ?w ?u))))))))

;; To illustrate the comments above regarding the schematic definition
;; D2.3, note that, with the fusion operator the sum-of operator can
;; be defined simply and elegantly as follows:
;;
;; (forall (?x ?y)
;; 	(= (sum-of ?x ?y)
;;	   (fusion-of (?z)
;;		      (or (part-of ?z ?x)
;;			  (part-of ?z ?y)))))

;; D2.5 (prod-of)

(documentation prod-of "The product of ?x and ?y is the largest thing whose parts are both parts of ?x and parts of ?y. Like `sum-of', this too is an idempotent, commutative, distributive operation, though one that is defined only if ?x overlaps ?y.")
