&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: SUO: Some proposed rules and interpretations 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Frank,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is indeed helpful and illuminating.  SUO does need a 
&gt; &gt; fresh start, and
&gt; &gt; agreeing on ground rules is a good way to proceed. The 
&gt; &gt; important thing is
&gt; &gt; that the rules be known in advance to avoid misunderstanding. 
&gt; &gt; It is also
&gt; &gt; important that any adaptations be suited to the realities of the SUO
&gt; &gt; project as it has developed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree with you that Jim's proposals hang together much 
&gt; &gt; better once one
&gt; &gt; accepts a quorum requirement for a minimal level of 
&gt; &gt; participation.  I am
&gt; &gt; happy to reread his provisions in that light (though I am 
&gt; &gt; quite sure from
&gt; &gt; prior discussions with him that his intended meaning was to 
&gt; &gt; eliminate a
&gt; &gt; threshold requirement altogether).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As a general matter, quorum requirements are designed to provide an
&gt; &gt; incentive to solicit active participation, to make reasonable 
&gt; &gt; allowance
&gt; &gt; for tabulation and notification problems, and to guard 
&gt; &gt; against domination
&gt; &gt; by a rump.  I am happy to substitute the term "minimal level of
&gt; &gt; participation" for quorum provided we all understand that a 
&gt; &gt; vote is not
&gt; &gt; valid unless a pre-published threshold of participation is achieved.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We have just faced the quorum/participation issue in a very 
&gt; &gt; mild version
&gt; &gt; in the election of the chair, our first official vote.  The number of
&gt; &gt; votes in Paul Eastman's initial report of Jim's election fell one vote
&gt; &gt; below the 50% quorum level (23/47).  A second, restated report was
&gt; &gt; requested off-line to make reasonable allowance for excusably "late"
&gt; &gt; ballots (three came in a few hours after a deadline keyed to 
&gt; &gt; an unfamiliar
&gt; &gt; time zone, perhaps because of slow server queues) so that, on Paul's
&gt; &gt; second report, which was placed on-line, we reached 55% 
&gt; &gt; (26/47), a valid
&gt; &gt; result.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would agree with you that some such threshold is needed in 
&gt; &gt; all future
&gt; &gt; official balloting and see nothing unworkable with 50% (currently 24
&gt; &gt; votes), given that it was exceeded on a pro forma uncontested 
&gt; &gt; vote.  A 20%
&gt; &gt; rule keyed to the minimal participation level for petitions to vote on
&gt; &gt; dissenting views seems reasonable, so that if we continue 
&gt; &gt; with the default
&gt; &gt; 50% participation requirement, 5 votes is reasonable (it is 
&gt; &gt; about 20% of
&gt; &gt; 50% of our total list); if we lower the quorum/participation 
&gt; &gt; threshold to
&gt; &gt; 40%, a petition of four should prevail. (I and perhaps others would be
&gt; &gt; inclined to second any well-formulated proposal even if I 
&gt; &gt; disagreed with
&gt; &gt; it, to assure adequate attention to minority views.)  On the numbers,
&gt; &gt; Jim's proposal for a rule-of-five on petitions fits 
&gt; &gt; coherently with a 50%
&gt; &gt; participation threshold in a group of about 50. As you point out, the
&gt; &gt; whole purpose of tabulating abstentions is to keep a quorum 
&gt; &gt; involved, even
&gt; &gt; when members are uninformed and/or indifferent on some particular
&gt; &gt; question.  For SUO these figures-- 50% + a rule of five for 
&gt; &gt; resolutions--
&gt; &gt; seem much better suited to group-wide procedural resolutions than to
&gt; &gt; technical ones, because we have already embarked on a 
&gt; &gt; multi-track course
&gt; &gt; in which the full group involvement may be reserved for well worked
&gt; &gt; reports by subgroups.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Your numbered points on the Chairman and the Technical Editor 
&gt; &gt; strike me
&gt; &gt; as well worked out and rooted in best practices, and the 
&gt; &gt; observations on
&gt; &gt; the sensitivity required by of the Chair and Technical Editor 
&gt; &gt; to building
&gt; &gt; consensus are especially worthy of note.  However, the 
&gt; &gt; implicit model of a
&gt; &gt; group working on a single document is not really applicable if we have
&gt; &gt; already decided on smaller working groups, each with its own Technical
&gt; &gt; Editor, proceeding on perhaps three documents/approaches 
&gt; &gt; concurrently, and
&gt; &gt; possibly meeting face-to-face in committees of as few as three to
&gt; &gt; accelerate development.  Because Matthew West addresses this 
&gt; &gt; contingency
&gt; &gt; directly and has in addition targeted toward "Resolutions", 
&gt; &gt; the thread he
&gt; &gt; began seems to me move us well along the path to shaping 
&gt; &gt; resolutions.  To
&gt; &gt; take what I view as the best of your own and Jim's views we 
&gt; &gt; would resolve
&gt; &gt; that for group-wide balloting
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     a) 50% participation of those eligible to vote be required for a
&gt; &gt; valid ballot;
&gt; &gt;     b) permissible votes be ......(e.g. yes, yes with 
&gt; &gt; comment, no, no with
&gt; &gt; comment, abstain);
&gt; &gt;     c) abstentions be counted for determining level of 
&gt; &gt; participation only;
&gt; &gt;     d) 20% of the minimal threshold for participation, rounded to the
&gt; &gt; nearest integer, be the minimal threshold for proposing resolutions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the rule of five for technical matters, I think we all 
&gt; &gt; agree that this
&gt; &gt; is unduly cumbersome in the negative for smaller technical 
&gt; &gt; sub-groups (as
&gt; &gt; a threshold for objections). In a small group a single 
&gt; &gt; objection based on
&gt; &gt; scientific merit will be accepted fairly harmoniously without 
&gt; &gt; email vote
&gt; &gt; tabulations.  And a single second should suffice to test 
&gt; &gt; sentiment in the
&gt; &gt; event of serious disagreement.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the other hand a "positive" rule-of-five is one of several useful
&gt; &gt; reality tests before any document is accepted for work in a 
&gt; &gt; multi-track
&gt; &gt; system.  Am I correct in recalling that by house rules it 
&gt; &gt; takes five to
&gt; &gt; maintain a standard in its early years?  Thinking backwards from this
&gt; &gt; requirement, it seems a threshold test of realism that any document
&gt; &gt; accepted for working group status be subscribed to for comment and
&gt; &gt; maintenance over four years by five or more mutually 
&gt; &gt; independent members.
&gt; &gt; (Mutually independent means not coordinated by single 
&gt; &gt; sponsor.) This is
&gt; &gt; not an onerous rule, especially since members can subscribe 
&gt; &gt; to more than
&gt; &gt; one document.  Further tests of realism: that there be a 
&gt; &gt; technical editor
&gt; &gt; for each document, that there be funding and/or serious 
&gt; &gt; commitment of time
&gt; &gt; sufficient to produce a final result, that elementary 
&gt; &gt; conditions likely to
&gt; &gt; be required in a final approval process be built into the 
&gt; &gt; original design.
&gt; &gt; I am aware that the implementation of some of these tests as internal
&gt; &gt; guidelines for SUO will superadd conditions to the house 
&gt; &gt; rules, and think
&gt; &gt; that, as in the procedural matters above, this is both permissible and
&gt; &gt; desirable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My personal thanks for bringing your knowledge to bear in giving the
&gt; &gt; SUO a fresh start.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Taken together these rules do not cohere, though in 
&gt; &gt; isolation each might
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem reasonable. For example, the proposed rule eliminating quorum
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirements entirely does not cohere with a high 
&gt; &gt; seconding requirement of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; five votes to apply to even technical objections.  (We 
&gt; &gt; could in principle
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have votes in which only four people participated counted 
&gt; &gt; as valid, while
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; four people would not suffice to object to the result).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Lee-
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; At first glance, I had some similar thoughts.  However, I 
&gt; &gt; realized that all 
&gt; &gt; &gt; three are truly separate aspects (however, the "seconding" 
&gt; &gt; and "objecting" 
&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers should be the same, see below).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------
&gt; &gt; &gt; On the "quorum" issue ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that "quorum" is not a factor in E-mail 
&gt; &gt; (correspondence-based) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; consensus-building because there is no sense of "being 
&gt; &gt; present" (everyone is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; presumed to be continuously present ... yes, some people 
&gt; &gt; may be on vacation, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; but ballots are typically 30 days ... we would presume that 
&gt; &gt; a participant 
&gt; &gt; &gt; must access their E-mail at least once every 30 days).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In correspondence-based standards committee processes 
&gt; &gt; (which is pretty much 
&gt; &gt; &gt; how many standards committees operated for the 100 years up 
&gt; &gt; until the mid to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; late 1990's), there is some minimum requirement of 
&gt; &gt; *responses* to letter 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ballots (an E-mail ballot is, in effect, a letter ballot).  
&gt; &gt; Typically, the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirement is 50% ... this is one of the cases where 
&gt; &gt; Abstains count: the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; number of responses is Yes + No + Abstain.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd recommend that we require a minimum number of responses 
&gt; &gt; to E-mail 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (letter) ballots, say 50%.  We shouldn't call this a 
&gt; &gt; "quorum" because
&gt; &gt; the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; term "quorum" can confuse people in this context.  We 
&gt; &gt; should call this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; something like "minimum number of ballot responses".
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Using a "minimum number of ballot responses" serves the 
&gt; &gt; same purpose as a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "quorum" in in-person meetings: it ensures that committee 
&gt; &gt; decisions were 
&gt; &gt; &gt; made by a "substantial" number of participants 
&gt; &gt; ("subtantial" might be 1/3, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 40%, 50%, 2/3, 3/4 ... the choice is a matter of opinion, each with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; different strengths and weaknesses).  For RR00, a default 
&gt; &gt; "quorum" is a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; majority, i.e., &gt;50%, but organizations may agree upon 
&gt; &gt; different numbers.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------
&gt; &gt; &gt; On a second (third, fourth, or fifth) ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In RROO (Robert's Rules of Order), the purpose of a second 
&gt; &gt; is minimize the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; amount frivolous discussion (in terms of formal committee 
&gt; &gt; deliberations ... 
&gt; &gt; &gt; we can have as much "frivolous" discussion as we like 
&gt; &gt; outside the formal 
&gt; &gt; &gt; deliberation on the E-mail reflector).  Choosing the right 
&gt; &gt; level of support 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e., choosing a number like 2 in RROO, or choosing 5 as 
&gt; &gt; Jim suggested) is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a matter of opinion.  I really believe that Jim is correct 
&gt; &gt; in assessing the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; large amount of administrative work (which includes all of 
&gt; &gt; us volunteers) in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; formal votes and, possibly, subsequent ballot resolution.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know if 5 is the right number, but it sounds 
&gt; &gt; reasonable to me.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Although a formula can make it more complex, I'd like the 
&gt; &gt; number 5 (or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever it is) to shrink if the number of voting members 
&gt; &gt; shrinks.  The 
&gt; &gt; &gt; minimum should be 2.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------
&gt; &gt; &gt; On an objection to votes by acclimation (as Jim phrased it: 
&gt; &gt; "does anyone 
&gt; &gt; &gt; object to ..." for minor issues from the Chair and 
&gt; &gt; consensus-building for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Technical Editor) ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to peel apart several aspects of Jim's 
&gt; &gt; suggestions.  First, the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; primary purpose of voting by acclamation is to speed the 
&gt; &gt; process when there 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is overwhelming agreement (see my excerpt of RROO at the 
&gt; &gt; end of this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; E-mail).  In in-person meetings, this can be determined by 
&gt; &gt; lots of nodding 
&gt; &gt; &gt; heads ... harder to determine in E-mail discussion.  I 
&gt; &gt; believe three things 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are necessary to make this work:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;         1.  The Chair needs to get a good sense that there are no 
&gt; &gt; &gt; objections.  I can't give any hard and fast rules, but it 
&gt; &gt; just comes from 
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience.  Maybe the Chair can give a preliminary message 
&gt; &gt; like "I'm not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hearing any objections to such and such and I'd like to get 
&gt; &gt; a vote by 
&gt; &gt; &gt; acclamation".  FYI, Paul (who just ran the Chair's election) made a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; reasonable assumption on voting by acclamation because 
&gt; &gt; there was no opposing 
&gt; &gt; &gt; candidate.  FYI2, SUO members, too, made a reasonable 
&gt; &gt; request to have a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; formal vote (see below).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;         2.  Contentious issues should not be voted on by 
&gt; &gt; acclamation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;         3.  Participants should be reasonable in their 
&gt; &gt; objections to votes 
&gt; &gt; &gt; by acclamation.  In other words, don't just presume grand 
&gt; &gt; conspiricies and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; evil intentions ... this only adds ill will, frustration, 
&gt; &gt; and loss of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable time.  A simple "I object to the vote by 
&gt; &gt; acclamation.  I'd rather 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a formal vote." is all that is necessary.  This 
&gt; &gt; (collabration and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; consensus-building in *this* group) is a learning 
&gt; &gt; experience for all us ... 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it may take a while for the Chair and the participants to 
&gt; &gt; get the right 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense of things.  If you have insights on how the Chair 
&gt; &gt; might have misread 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the committee, then send your suggestions to the Chair 
&gt; &gt; directly ... no need 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to tie up E-mail reflector bandwidth.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The second half of this is consensus-building for the 
&gt; &gt; Technical Editor.  The 
&gt; &gt; &gt; TE can use several strategies for improving the document.  
&gt; &gt; However, the most 
&gt; &gt; &gt; important feature of the TE's work is that (1) he make 
&gt; &gt; changes based on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; direction from the group, (2) he use his judgement to make 
&gt; &gt; suggestions, and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) his work requires approval (e.g., every new formal 
&gt; &gt; draft) from the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; group.  In other words, there are a good number of 
&gt; &gt; "controls" over the TE's 
&gt; &gt; &gt; work.  I wouldn't want to constrain the TE's work to the 
&gt; &gt; 5-person rule 
&gt; &gt; &gt; because even one person's objections might make sense (see 
&gt; &gt; the notion of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "consensus" at the end of this E-mail).  The role of the TE 
&gt; &gt; is to make 
&gt; &gt; &gt; educated guesses about the consensus of the Working Group 
&gt; &gt; ... like the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chair, he may make some mistakes, but please give him some 
&gt; &gt; leeway ... we are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; all trying to do this electronically, so there may be some miscues.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; In conclusion, the 5-person objection rule (or whatever the 
&gt; &gt; number) is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; primarily a tool to help speed the adminstrative and 
&gt; &gt; consensus-building 
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspects of the committee (the Chair) ... not a vehicle to 
&gt; &gt; rush things 
&gt; &gt; &gt; through.  The number for objections should be the same number for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "seconding" because an objection causes a formal vote, just 
&gt; &gt; like "seconding" 
&gt; &gt; &gt; does.  As I said above, I don't recommend the 5-person 
&gt; &gt; minimum for the TE's 
&gt; &gt; &gt; work since there are regular, formal votes to approve new drafts.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there some e-mail template that has worked elsehwere ("a best
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice")  that we can adopt?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The suggestions above are based on best/existing practices 
&gt; &gt; from ISO, IEC, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; NCITS, and IEEE standards committees.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; These suggestions on "quorum" (actually, participation 
&gt; &gt; level) are based on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; existing formal ballot rules for many standards committees 
&gt; &gt; (ISO/IEC, NCITS, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; IEEE).
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The suggestions on "acclamation" for the Chair are based on 
&gt; &gt; RROO in the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; section on "Voting by General Consent".  Here's an excerpt 
&gt; &gt; (from "The New 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Robert's Rules of Order", Barnes and Noble pocket edition, ISBN 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 0-88029-972-X, pages 154-155):
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;         General Consent.  When the formality of motions and 
&gt; &gt; voting can be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; avoided in routine business and on questions of little 
&gt; &gt; importance, business 
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be handled with greater efficiency, the chair assuming general 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (unanimous) consent until someone objects.  General consent 
&gt; &gt; does not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily mean that every member is in facvor of the 
&gt; &gt; motion, but, knowing 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is useless to oppose it or even to discuss it, the 
&gt; &gt; opposition simply 
&gt; &gt; &gt; acquiesces in the formality.  Thus, in the case of 
&gt; &gt; approving the minutes, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the chair asks if there are any corrections.  If one is 
&gt; &gt; suggested, it is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; made.  When no correction is suggested, the chair says, 
&gt; &gt; "There being no 
&gt; &gt; &gt; corrections [or no further corrections] the minutes stand 
&gt; &gt; approved".  While 
&gt; &gt; &gt; routine and minor matters can be rapidly diposed of in this 
&gt; &gt; way, any time an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; objection is made promptly, the chair ignores what has been 
&gt; &gt; done even if he 
&gt; &gt; &gt; has announced the result, and requires a regular vote.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The suggestions on the TE's (using his judgement to assess 
&gt; &gt; objections, seek 
&gt; &gt; &gt; compromises, and build consensus) are the "common sense" 
&gt; &gt; one learns in that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; role ... as mentioned above, there are "controls" from the 
&gt; &gt; working group 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that make sure the WG gets what it wants ... the TE is an informed 
&gt; &gt; &gt; participant that helps with the editing tasks.  In ISO/IEC 
&gt; &gt; committees, as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; convener (a position similar to a Chair), one learns the 
&gt; &gt; "consensus" is the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; absence of sustained, substanial opposition ... that 
&gt; &gt; doesn't mean unanimous 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ... it's a judgement call.  The TE's need to have a sense 
&gt; &gt; of "consensus" to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; direct their work.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this helps.
