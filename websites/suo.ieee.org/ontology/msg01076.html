Dear Pat,

See comments below.

&gt; 
&gt; Matthew.R.West@is.shell.com, replying to Chris Partridge:
&gt; 
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The class holds the
&gt; &gt;properties that are true for each member of the set, e.g. 
&gt; the molecular
&gt; &gt;weight of a water molecule,
&gt; 
&gt; What does 'holds' mean? One can form a set of anything, even things 
&gt; that have nothing in common. It would be a mistake to say that a 
&gt; shared property of all members of a set was a property of the set, or 
&gt; was (usually) to be identified with the set itself: so what do you 
&gt; mean here? (And similarly for a fusion 'holding' a property, below.)

MW: Yes you're right. I was being a bit sloppy and referring to what we
might call classes where the members have something in common. What they
have in common is a "property" of the members of the set/class, and is
usually related to the set/class.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the fusion holds the bulk properties that are
&gt; &gt;true of the sum of the members of the set, e.g. the mass of 
&gt; a glass of
&gt; &gt;water.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the fusion *is* the sum, so I guess this must be true, but it 
&gt; is kind of trivial.

MW: I know, but I'm surprised how many times it needs saying.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;There is a one-to-one relationship between the set and the fusion.
&gt; 
&gt; No, several different sets will correspond to the same fusion. For 
&gt; example, consider a set of people, and the set of all the parts of 
&gt; those people. The corresponding mereosums are identical. Mereology 
&gt; divides up the world up more coarsely than sets do.

MW: You are correct (at least in a 4D world). In a later e-mail I spot my
error. Of course this just makes it more obvious that it is inappropriate to
combine a fusion and a set/class.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;What I think you are doing is asking whether, given the one-to-one
&gt; &gt;relationship, is it not possible to merge the two objects?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My answer is no, because despite the one to one 
&gt; relationship, the nature of
&gt; &gt;the relationship between the object and its constituents is 
&gt; different in
&gt; &gt;each case. Let me try to explain with an example.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have 10 pumps, 6 of them are centrifugal pumps, 4 of them are
&gt; &gt;reciprocating pumps. I have now introduced some new objects, pump,
&gt; &gt;centrifugal pump and reciprocating pump. These are classes, 
&gt; and I can have
&gt; &gt;the class of these, which I will call pump type. Pump is the 
&gt; superclass of
&gt; &gt;centrifugal pump and reciprocating pump.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now, for my centrifugal pumps I have a fusion (#1) that is 
&gt; the aggregate of
&gt; &gt;the centrifugal pumps, and I have a fusion (#2)that is the 
&gt; aggregate of the
&gt; &gt;reciprocating pumps. I also have the fusion of all my pumps 
&gt; (#3) where #3=#1
&gt; &gt;+ #2.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now let us see what happens if we combine the fusion and the 
&gt; set. What I am
&gt; &gt;saying when I combine these two is that a class can have the 
&gt; bulk properties
&gt; &gt;of the members of the class as well as the properties that 
&gt; are true for each
&gt; &gt;member of the class.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now my centrifugal pumps class has a mass which is the mass 
&gt; of all the
&gt; &gt;centrifugal pumps, as does the class of reciprocating pumps 
&gt; and the class of
&gt; &gt;pumps, where mass(#3) = mass(#1) + mass(#2).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So far so good. However, this is not where the story ends. 
&gt; Pump, centrifugal
&gt; &gt;pump, and reciprocating pump are members of the class pump 
&gt; type. These all
&gt; &gt;have mass, therefore I can have the fusion of them, So I get 
&gt; that #4 = #1 +
&gt; &gt;#2 + #3. Well let us assume that we are smart enough to spot 
&gt; that #3 = #1 +
&gt; &gt;#2, and that with overlapping objects you don't count them 
&gt; twice in either
&gt; &gt;fusion or class membership, so we end up with #4 = #1 + #2 = #3.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So now I have two classes with the some of the same 
&gt; properties, pump, and
&gt; &gt;pump type. This is not what you want. The reason that this 
&gt; has happened is
&gt; &gt;that a non-transitive relation (classification) has had to 
&gt; do dual duty as a
&gt; &gt;transitive relation aggregation, because the objects 
&gt; constructed from these
&gt; &gt;different relations were combined.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Am interesting case where simplification looks smart but isn't.
&gt; 
&gt; Nice example, and I entirely concur with your overall point.

MW: Thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; Pat

Regards  
      Matthew
