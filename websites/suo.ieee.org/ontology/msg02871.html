Phil --

I thought one of Lakoff's major points was that all concepts are like what
you call irregular concepts.  He uses the framework of idealized cognitive
models (ICMs) to represent the multi-dimensionality of categories, where
individual categories have a closer or more distant fit along each of the
dimensions.

Since I'm concerned with business applicability of this stuff, I like to
use as an example the concept of "product".  For anything we might call a
product there are dimensions of offering agent, target agents, input
components, creation or assembly process, value, distribution, buy/sell
transaction, etc.  The canonical example of a product might be a consumer
packaged good, like a box of cereal.  Other examples that are more or less
distant on the various dimensions include: processed grain flour used to
make the cereal, a boxcar load of wheat destined for the flour mill, a
grain futures contract, a box used to package the cereal, cardboard
destined to become cereal boxes, an advertising campaign to help promote
the cereal brand, a set of graphics designed as part of the advertising
campaign, product liability insurance associated with the brand, etc. etc.

My position is that almost everything we deal with has this kind of
complexity.  The service provided by the ontological discipline is in
articulating key dimensions of differentiation and patterns (like Lakoff's
ICMs) whereby they apply in various combinations.  I think we really pretty
much waste our time in trying to find or create "single, logical
definitions".  My experience is that most attempts to simplify essential
complexity end up introducing additional complication based on all the
argumentation around how to apply the supposed "simplification".

Doug,

[DM]
&gt; &gt; The point that I am on is more along the lines of:  The concept
&gt; of a team
&gt; &gt; (in the sense of a sports team) has to do intrinsically with
&gt; the intent of
&gt; &gt; sporting competition.  This is composed of a whole set of interlocking
&gt; &gt; issues of intent, such as entertainment, physical fitness,
&gt; sublimation of
&gt; &gt; aggression, etc.  The intent of a professional sports team has
&gt; significant
&gt; &gt; overlap with that of an organized youth team, with in turn overlaps
&gt; &gt; significantly with a team chosen ad hoc to run a three-legged race at a
&gt; &gt; family picnic.  Yet each of these types of teams has significant
&gt; &gt; differentiation on the dimensions of intent, as well.  There's
&gt; a rich vein
&gt; &gt; of ontology to be found here, and it's more interesting to me to
&gt; &gt; think that
&gt; &gt; this effort will mine it to some level, rather than reducing it to a
dry
&gt; &gt; agent/not-agent distinction.

[PJ]
&gt; Yes, I'd agree -- Depending on our intent, representing these
&gt; differing levels of intent could be very relevant. The concepts
&gt; of "team" and "contest" also go beyond sporting events, into
&gt; other real-world situations that can be very important, of course.

One other point to make is that the concept of "contest" is related to
"game", which many people (Wittgenstein, Rosch, Lakoff, ...) argue is an
"irregular concept", i.e. not susceptible to a single, logical definition,
and needing to some extent to be described by a collection of examples,
exceptions, prototypes, etc. This ties in with the ideas of mining
ontologies, and describing ontologies via associations, ontology maps, etc.

To better represent the range of real world concepts, we may need to
develop
a framework for "heterogenous concept representation", which allows
intermixing regular and irregular concept definitions, i.e. giving a
definition / description of a (regular / irregular) concept in terms of
other concepts, each of which may be regular or irregular. Such a framework
may also need to allow use of metaphorical mechanisms to define / describe
new concepts in terms of others.
