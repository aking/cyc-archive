&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	Below is my response to Pat Hayes' criticism.  It does 
&gt; repeat some
&gt; &gt;points that I've made in earlier postings, but I thought it would be
&gt; &gt;worthwhile to try to collect these points into a single reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for doing so. I will try to respond in a similarly 
&gt; organised fashion.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree that a methodology of simply adjoining concepts and 
&gt; axioms from
&gt; &gt;disparate sources would be fundamentally flawed.  However, 
&gt; this is not what
&gt; &gt;I tried to do.  I attempted to integrate the axioms/subsumption
&gt; &gt;relationships of various ontologies into the same stock of 
&gt; concepts (taken
&gt; &gt;from a simplified version of John Sowa's upper-level 
&gt; ontology).  In detail,
&gt; &gt;the procedure I used is as follows.  The first step was to 
&gt; convert all of
&gt; &gt;the ontologies listed on the SUO Candidate Content web page
&gt; &gt;(<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>) into SUO-KIF.  Once this was
&gt; &gt;accomplished, I selected the most general ontology (John 
&gt; Sowa's upper level
&gt; &gt;ontology) as the base ontology.  I then mapped 
&gt; concepts/axioms from the
&gt; &gt;remaining ontologies into the base ontology.  In this 
&gt; mapping process, there
&gt; &gt;were two possible cases, each in turn with two subcases.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1.  New content (Nothing in the merged ontology corresponds with the
&gt; &gt;concept/axiom to be mapped)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  	a. Useful/Relatively Noncontroversial content.  In this 
&gt; subcase, the
&gt; &gt;new concept/axiom is deemed to 	be useful and not to violate 
&gt; &gt;any cherished
&gt; &gt;philosophical principles.  Once I decided that the new 
&gt; &gt;	concept/axiom should
&gt; &gt;be included, it was simply a matter of finding a place for it in the
&gt; &gt;ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, on what basis do you decide what the appropriate place for it is 
&gt; in that heirarchy? For example, consider the mereotopological 'part' 
&gt; relation and the things it applies to. Must these be continuants or 
&gt; occurents, or both, or neither? I can see arguments all ways, but no 
&gt; clear answer. What were your guiding principles for making these 
&gt; choices?

Well, there are really two different cases here.  One relates to the
subclassing or classification of a concept within the ontology, and the
other relates to the assignment of selectional restrictions to a predicate
within the ontology.  As for the first case, I looked for the most specific
subsumer of the given class.  For example, in merging the ITBM-CNR ontology
for natural kinds (essentially a taxonomy of biological organisms), I had to
connect its highest-level notion, viz. 'Organism', with something in Sowa's
ontology.  It seemed to me that every instance of Organism (in the ITBM-CNR
ontology) was also Organic (according to Sowa's construal).  Furthermore,
there didn't seem to be a more specific class than Organic to which every
Organism belongs.  As for selectional restrictions on predicates, I tended
to follow a fairly conservative policy here.  That is, I tried to make these
constaints as restrictive as possible.  My reasoning was that a predicate
whose application is too narrow is less likely, in general, to elicit
controversy than a predicate whose application is too broad.  Furthermore,
it is easier, especially within the context of a real knowledge-based
system, to relax selectional restrictions than to make them more
restrictive.  Accordingly, the current version of the merged ontology
requires that both arguments of the 'part-of' predicate be instances of
'CorpuscularObject', which is a subclass of 'Object', which, in turn, is a
subclass of 'Continuant'.  

&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	b. Useless/Controversial content.  In this subcase, the new
&gt; &gt;concept/axiom is judged (by me) to be 	either not useful or too
&gt; &gt;controversial for incorporation into a schema that we hope 
&gt; will have both
&gt; &gt;broad application and wide acceptance.  This is of course a 
&gt; very subjective
&gt; &gt;judgement, but ontology 	merging/alignment is probably 
&gt; much more of
&gt; &gt;an art than a science.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, fair enough. (As an aside, it might be useful to keep files of 
&gt; this 'rejected' content for future consideration. No doubt you are 
&gt; already doing that...)
&gt; 

Actually, the merged ontology has been under version control from the
outset, and I make check-ins on a weekly basis.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;2.  Old Content (There is some degree of overlap between the 
&gt; merged ontology
&gt; &gt;and the concept/axiom to be     mapped)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	a.  Perfect Overlap.  In this case, the terms may 
&gt; differ but the new
&gt; &gt;concept has the same semantic 	content as a concept 
&gt; already in the merged
&gt; &gt;ontology or, with respect to axioms, there is a logical 	
&gt; equivalence
&gt; &gt;between the new axiom and an existing axiom.  An example of 
&gt; this sort of
&gt; &gt;case occurs in 	the various mereotopological theories.  Some 
&gt; &gt;philosophers
&gt; &gt;use 'part-of' as the primitive notion to 	frame their 
&gt; axioms, some use
&gt; &gt;'overlaps', and still others use some notion of 'connection'. 
&gt; &gt;	However, in
&gt; &gt;many cases, axioms across these different systems are 
&gt; logically equivalent.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, this is where I start to worry, since this is an area where we 
&gt; have found very complex and tricky relationships between alternative 
&gt; formulations. For example, if one theory uses an 'adjacency' 
&gt; relationship but another defines adjacent as sharing a common 
&gt; boundary, then the two theories are likely to be incommensurate, in 
&gt; that they are quantifying over different universes, so the 
&gt; translation between them becomes very complicated to state. Its not 
&gt; impossible, let me emphasise, just *difficult* to get right; the 
&gt; axioms of one have to be rewritten in a completely different form to 
&gt; make them compatible with the other.


OK, point noted.  But it seems to me that these hypothetical
incommensurabilities can be addressed on a case-by-case basis as they are
realized and noted.  I can't think of some sort of reasonable policy that
would prevent these sorts of incompatibilities from creeping in, as long as
the strategy is one of merging/aligning the various extant high-level
conceptual schemas.  I know you have objections to this general strategy,
but I don't think you have proposed an alternative.  Note too that an
alternative is not something like:  "Let's try to get the 'foundations'
right before we go any further".  Western philosophy has been working on the
foundations for 2,500 years now, and we're still anxiously awaiting the
moment when two philosophers agree on any epistemological or metaphysical
point.  We don't have time to wait around for another 2,500 years, and we
need to constantly bear in mind (I would argue) that the goal is to produce
an engineering artifact, not to get straight about the nature of the
universe.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	b.  Partial Overlap.  In this case, there is some 
&gt; overlap in meaning
&gt; &gt;between the new content and 	existing concepts or axioms in 
&gt; the merged
&gt; &gt;ontology.  An example of this is the case role hierarchy.  	Although
&gt; &gt;John Sowa's system of case roles was part of the base 
&gt; ontology (and, hence,
&gt; &gt;the original 	merged ontology), I tried to simplify 
&gt; it somewhat to make it
&gt; &gt;more like other systems of case roles.  	Both systems follow:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I am (honestly) impressed by what you have done, but I still 
&gt; don't really know on what *basis* you have done it.  Suppose someone 
&gt; asked me to justify your choice of what you have kept in and what you 
&gt; have left out: I wouldnt know what to tell him.

I agree that this is difficult as far as the first two releases of the
merged ontology are concerned.  However, I do intend to carefully document
any future revision of or addition to the ontology.  Furthermore, every
revision/addition to the ontology will be presented to the mailing list for
comments, so there will be an e-trail in the archive to justify any
modification to the base ontology.

&gt; 
&gt; I realise that this sounds rather as though I am asking you do work 
&gt; even harder, when you are the only person who has done a stroke of 
&gt; work at all so far, and that hardly seems fair.  I agree, it isnt 
&gt; fair, and I wish there was something more constructive I could say. I 
&gt; really don't think that creating an SUO is a one-man job, so my 
&gt; carping about what you have done isnt meant to be a complaint about 
&gt; you personally. I don't think anyone could have done better, but 
&gt; maybe we shouldnt be trying to do it this way.
