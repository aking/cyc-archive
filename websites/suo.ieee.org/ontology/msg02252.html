Here are some mathematical definitions for some algebraic structures that
might be helpful in some of the current SUO discussion threads. What I
present below is well-known and reasonably standard in category-theoretic
circles, and corresponds somewhat to the discussion
[<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm#Representing">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm#Representing</A>] of John Sowa on
"representing relations by graphs". However, here I give the precise
definitions from a category-theoretic standpoint. There are several
definitions for the hypergraph concept, but here we start with the
definition of an unlabelled hypergraph used by John Sowa in the document
mentioned above, which we then generalize. I have already defined ontologies
for (the categories of) spans (hypergraphs) and binary relations using the
new KIF (SUO-KIF).
____________________

A *graph* G = [E, N, s, t] consists of a sets of nodes N and set of edges E
and two (total) functions, a source function s: E -&gt; N and a target function
t : E -&gt; N. We often picture the graph G as the following diagram in the
category Set, of sets and functions.

    s
    -&gt;
 E    N
    -&gt;
    t

This picture is a little hard to make using just ascii text.

If e is an edge in E with source node a = s(e) and target node b = t(e), we
often picture this as

    e
 a -&gt; b

Some things to note:

1. The two diagram above are on two different levels -- the first in the
category Set, the second in the graph G.

2. There are no constraints between the edge set E and the node set N; they
could either overlap or be disjoint; they could even be identical.

3. There may be any number of edges between any two nodes; although two
edges e1 and e2 share the same source and target nodes, they are abstract
things, not necessarily distinct labels for two different relations between
the nodes.
____________________

A binary (dyadic) *relation* R between two sets A and B is a subset of the
Cartesian product set AxB; that is, R \subset AxB. We can refer to the set A
as the domain of R and the set B as the codomain of R; then we say that
relation R is from domain A to domain B. The terminology source and target
can be also used for domain and codomain, respectively. However, these may
be on a different (category-theoretic and foundational) level than the
source and target of graph edges. Initially, it may be a little unclear how
to relate relations and graphs. The appropriate way is through the concept
of a span.
____________________

A *span* S from domain set A to codomain set B is a set of edges E and two
(total) functions, a source function s: E -&gt; A and a target function t :
E -&gt; B. Speaking in terms of graphs, we can regard the sets A and B as two
sets of nodes.

Some things to note:

1. There are no constraints between the edge set E and the node sets A and
B; they could either overlap, be disjoint, or even be identical.

2. Any graph G is a span, where the two node sets are identical A = B = N.

3. Any binary relation R can be embedded as a span S(R) -- the edge set is
R, the node sets are A and B, and the source and target functions are the
projection functions: when edge (a, b) is a member of R, then s(a, b) = a
and t(a, b) = b.
____________________

A *hypergraph* H (preliminary version) consists of a set N of nodes and a
set A of (hyper)arcs. Here, as distinct from graphs, each arc in E may have
an arbitrary number of endpoint nodes. Represent the fact that arc e has
endpoint node n by saying that the pair (e, n) is a member of H. This means
that H is just a binary relation from domain set A to codomain set N, and
hence is a special case of a span. Let us generalize by equating hypergraphs
with spans (perhaps this corresponds to John Sowa's labelled hypergraphs??);
that is, a (generalized) *hypergraph* H consists of a set of connectors or
indices E, a set of domain nodes or hyperarcs A, a set of codomain nodes or
ordinary nodes N, and two functions, a source function s : E - &gt; A from
connectors to hyperarcs and a target function from connectors to (ordinary)
nodes.

Some things to note:

1. Hypergraphs can represent multivalent relations, where each hyperarc of a
hypergraph represents one n-tuple or relationship among n entities in the
set of nodes N, and the connectors between hyperarcs and nodes represent the
roles.

2. So for the case

(gives John Mary book)

with correponding expression

(exists (?e)
    (and (giving ?e)
         (giver ?e John)
         (receiver ?e Mary)
         (given ?e book)))

one interpretation might be as follows:

at the level of instances

'(gives John Mary book)' and '?e' are hyperarcs,
'John', 'Mary' and 'book' are ordinary nodes,
'giver', 'receiver' and 'given' (or 'agent', 'patient' and 'thematic
object') are connector (types);

whereas 'gives' and 'giving' occur at the level of hyperarc types.
