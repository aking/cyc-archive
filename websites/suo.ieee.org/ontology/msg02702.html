Jon,

Peirce's "mind-less" formal definitions are only partially true because too abstract
if they are supposed to explain anything at all in practice. The formal definition
from L75 only describes the sign as one of the correlates of a triadic relation, i.e.
the sign as a being for an other. But a sign has in fact two beings: its being for an
other (the object) and its own being. It is not an isolated entity because it belongs
to a genuine triad , but nevertheless its entire being is not completely swallowed by
the triadic relation either. If the three elements (S, O, I) are of the nature of a
sign, in that they take part in a triadic relation (Peirce writes in the Lowell
Lectures that they are of the nature of "thirds" ), likewise, they have their own
being, the interpretant has its own being, the sign has its own being and the object
has its own being. So if you start from a formal definition that only refer to a
triadic relation and believe that you can explain everything from there, where each
element is reduced to its mode of being respective to the other correlates, then you
are missing half of the picture. In asking "what is a sign?", do not simply answer the
question by saying how a sign enters in relation with the other correlates, but ask
yourself also what a sign in actu really is, what is "an object of direct experience"
like? and the object of the sign:  what is a "fragment of history" like? , and finally
what is the interpretant, what is the determination of a mind? Or you have only walked
half the road.

&gt; Jean-Marc,
&gt;
&gt; A bit of a preface, and then on to specifics.
&gt; I would like to say that I am trying to keep
&gt; within the intersection of multiple pragmata,
&gt; those to which the folks who sign on for one
&gt; particular interest or another have to share.
&gt; But, of course, I can't say that, not in the
&gt; narrowest construction of the terms, since I
&gt; have distinct notions of what these concerns
&gt; ultimately urge us to.  So I think of myself
&gt; as working prospectively, toward that future
&gt; intersection, on earth, let us pray, and not
&gt; in the sky, of our several currently diverse,
&gt; sundry, skew, truncated, or transverse lines.
&gt; As I long as stay that course then I feel in
&gt; my own heart and mind that I am in true form.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon, I don't know why you insist on translating the term "mind"
&gt; &gt; into "a person's mind" each time that it appears in a definition.
&gt;
&gt; Our interest here is in "interpreters" of all kinds, interpretive agents,
&gt; conductors, and passengers, and even stowaways, on the trains of semiosis,
&gt; for which I, personally, but abstractly and formally, do not care what word
&gt; we deploy -- "quasi-mind" was one of Peirce's personal best -- so long as we
&gt; get the idea right, and that, in my current vein of extensional mining, leads
&gt; to the concourse of the sign relation itself.  And I have already cited all of
&gt; the most critical passages from Peirce along the way that lead to the same end.
&gt; And, no doubt, will again.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Peirce writes in another text (MS 787)  "What is mind except a
&gt; &gt; faculty for ideas?".  If 'mind' only means 'the mind of a person'
&gt; &gt; to you, then I understand your position, but you must be aware of
&gt; &gt; the fact that Peirce did not use the term in such a restricted way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Simply go through the "76 definitions" assembled at:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry that you force me to say this, but not all of these
&gt; so-called "definitions" are equal in their service to the idea,
&gt; nor could I expect them to be, since many were directed to one
&gt; particular application, audience, or level of approximation --
&gt; this is a fact of communication in general, and has nothing to
&gt; do with Peirce, per se -- it just so happens to be the reality
&gt; that some definitions are more definitive than others.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; and you will see that the term 'mind' or 'thought' or 'interpreting thought'
&gt; &gt; appears not only in "the-sop-to-cerberus" definition, but in nearly all of
&gt; &gt; them, which are the pragmatic definitions.  The only definitions that do
&gt; &gt; not have 'mind' in them are the formal ones that use the term 'correlate',
&gt; &gt; or 'C' or whatever-you-like-to-call-it.
&gt;
&gt; Nobody here, leastwise moi, is denying the prevalence of mind or consciousness
&gt; in our experience, if that is what you are worried about.  After I quit caring,
&gt; a long time ago, about that useless battle, I got myself moving on to looky at
&gt; the form and the pattern and the shape and the flow of all of this beauty that
&gt; just keeps on showing up in experience, as "contents" of that "container" that
&gt; all the warly folk call "consciousness".  After one gets over the bare fact of
&gt; it, one, this one, wishes to get on with delving into the form of it.  And for
&gt; carrying out that work the formal models that Peirce's work affords us, in the
&gt; form of sign relations, are simply the best tools for the job.  Given his very
&gt; clear staking out of a non-psychological line of inquiry -- which I can abduce
&gt; from other evidence to interrupret as a n.o.n.psychological line -- it is easy
&gt; to see that all of his other references to mind in a logical framework have to
&gt; be taken as applications and illustrations, not constitutive of logic, per se.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have no problem in understanding the difference between
&gt; &gt; a formal definition that is as general as possible and needs
&gt; &gt; not refer to anything existing in particular and its application
&gt; &gt; in practice, so I believe that the discussion on whether the definition
&gt; &gt; of a sign should be either purely abstract and formal or more specialized
&gt; &gt; by referring to a 'mind' in general is of no interest whatsoever, except
&gt; &gt; for theorists who can't make the link between theory and practice.
&gt;
&gt; Logic and psychology are independent.  Orthogonal.  At right angles to each other.
&gt; There is no contest here.  We are not dividing up a pie.  The lines are imaginary.
&gt; I have been to county road commission meetings where one party argues that all of
&gt; the roads in the county should go north-northwest and another party counters that
&gt; all of the roads in the county should go east-northeast, so I know that many such
&gt; journeys of discourse are possible.  Me, I just quit attending those meetings.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; "What is a sign?"  Try and answer that question using the pragmatic maxim.
&gt; &gt; What are all the imaginable effects of a sign?  Do they affect only abstract
&gt; &gt; correlates in a formula?
&gt;
&gt; "Go teach your grandmother to suck eggs." --
&gt; That's old version of "Been there, done that".
&gt;
&gt; Still doing that,
&gt;
