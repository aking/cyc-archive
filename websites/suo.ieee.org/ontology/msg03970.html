Jon,

I said that you have to start where the students are, but I didn't
say that you have to leave them there.  And what you say to different
students depends on many factors:  (1) their willingness to listen,
(2) their ability to absorb the information, (3) their ability to
take large steps, small steps, or baby steps, (4) how much work
they are willing to do on their own, (5) their motivation, and most
importantly (6) their ability to discover new things on their own.
And as Peirce himself said of some of his listeners, &quot;Oh, well.&quot;

JA&gt; I will merely summate by telling you more of what you already know,
 &gt; that you can build all the bridges you want, but you will not
 &gt; goad or gadfly anybody across the pons asinorum by
 &gt; supporting their smug illusions that they have
 &gt; already virtually arrived on the other side.

Indeed, many people don't even know that there is another side.
That is sometimes the hardest message to communicate.  But in
any case, an ISO standards document is not the place to convince
anybody of anything.  Its sole purpose is to serve as a reference
for implementers who have already been convinced (either by their
own convictions or by the salary they are paid for doing the job).

JA&gt; This is the strategy that Morris tried with
 &gt; Peirce's semiotics, and you know how well
 &gt; that turned out -- I can't imagine that
 &gt; you imagine that the same technique
 &gt; will work any better for his logic.

Morris failed for many different reasons.  The main reason
is that he didn't understand logic.  That meant that he really
didn't understand either Peirce or Carnap (the chief person
he failed to convince).  Since he didn't fully understand
Peirce, he couldn't communicate CSP's ideas adequately to
anyone (as is obvious from his writings).  Since he didn't
understand Carnap, he couldn't correct Carnap's mistakes.
In short, Morris couldn't find either Peirce's end of the
bridge or Carnap's, so he was hopeless as a guide.

Then another major reason for Morris's failure was the poor
quality of the editing of Peirce's _Collected Papers_, which
were collected by two people who also didn't understand logic.
The papers were scattered throughout the many volumes in such
an order that they wouldn't impress a logician who wasn't already
inclined to take them seriously.  That includes both Carnap and
Quine, who already believed that the true religion had come down
from Frege.

The major tragedy for both logic and philosophy in the 20th century
was the premature death of Frank Ramsey.  Ramsey was a brilliant
mathematician and logician who really understood Peirce.  He is the
one who communicated enough of CSP's ideas to Wittgenstein to enable
W. to see that his entire early philosophy (as well as Russell's,
Frege's, and the whole Vienna Circle's) was a dead end.  Unfortunately,
Ramsey died before he could convince anyone else and before he could
get W. to read more of Peirce's writings.

I'm sure that you have read Jaime Nubiola's article about the
relations between Peirce, Ramsey, and Wittgenstein, but for anyone
else who may be interested, following is the URL:
