&gt; 

&gt; One thing we do have is the ability to give a bunch of axioms a name, 

&gt; and then include them in another module by using the name. 

&gt; 

MW: As long as that was recurcsive, i.e. the module referred to would 

pull in the modules it in turn referred to, then this would I believe 

meet the requirement. How does the syntax look? 



The following is a DRAFT of a PROPOSAL to an UNOFFICIAL AD_HOC WORKING GROUP
which has not even been ACCEPTED by them, so it is about as far from being
approved as anything can get. That said, I would welcome any feedback.: 


------ 

Namespaces and inclusion 


An ontology (traditionally called a 'theory' in logic) is a set of
assertional expressions. Each ontology has an associated vocabulary or
namespace, defined to be all the identifiers used in its expressions, other
than those with a predefined logical meaning. A KIF ontology can be given a
name, which can be indicated in KIF by enclosing all the expressions of the
ontology, preceded by the word "ontology" and the name itself, within
parentheses. Such an expression is called an ontology form. (We use this
label, rather than "expression", since the form does not denote anything,
but indicates a set of axioms by ostention.) Such a name of the ontology is
considered to be part of the ontology namespace, so must be distinct from
other symbols in that namespace; it is called a local name. 


Other methods for giving names to ontologies are acceptable. In particular,
the ontology may reside on a web page, or in a computer file, in which case
the URI of the page, or the name of the file, may be used as names for the
ontology (provided they are KIF lexical items. They can usually be made
acceptable by inserting backslashes in front of any interlexical
characters.) These are intended to have a scope which extends beyond the
ontology itself, so are called global names. KIF assumes that some external
process is capable of accessing the ontology named by a global name, so the
exact form of global names is not mandated by the KIF standard. Some
convention should be establsihed which guarantees the uniqueness of global
ontology names within any proposed community of usage. Following current
practice, URI's used as global ontology names are taken to refer to a KIF
ontology at the location indicated by the URI. [ref:
<A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/</A> ] 


Ontologies can be combined in two ways. 


An ontology can include another simply by containing an ontology form for
the other ontology.  

MW: What does this mean?

 In this way one ontology can simply be included inside another, and its
sentences are considered to be a subset of those in the including ontology ,
and the namespace of the included ontology is part of that of the including
ontology. In effect, the inner ontology form provides a name for a subset of
the sentences of the larger ontology, simply as a book-keeping convenience.


MW: I think this is more accurately a way of defining a module within some
ontology as a named part (if I read you correctly) but I'm really not sure.
In particular I'm not sure whether or not it is valid for an ontology to be
included in two other distinct ontologies. 

MW: What syntax is used for this?


An ontology can also be imported by including an expression consisting of
the word "imports" and the name of the ontology, enclosed in parentheses.
(The notion of importing is intended to be the same as that used in DAML+OIL
[ref: <A  HREF="http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil-index">http://www.daml.org/2000/12/daml+oil-index</A> ] .) This allows an
ontology to include content from ontologies accessed remotely, for example
from another website, or from elsewhere in an intranet filing system.
Importation differs from inclusion in that the namespace of the importing
ontology is disjoint from that of the imported ontology.  

MW: So the same name could appear in both ontologies but with different
meanings?

 To refer to something with name &lt;name&gt; in &lt;namespace&gt; from outside that
namespace, one writes &lt;namespace&gt;#&lt;name&gt;. For example, if an ontology called
'arithmetic' uses the function name 'plus', then the name of this function
will be 'arithmetic#plus' elsewhere in any ontology which contains the
expression '(imports arithmetic)'. In this way ontologies may include axioms
which use vocabulary introduced in other ontologies.  

 (Note. There is one exception to this rule, where one ontology consists
entirely of declarations and no #-prefixing is required. This is used only
in sorted KIF.)  

MW: Can you give an example please. 


As a convenience, an ontology can be given a local name in the importing
expression, eg 

(imports ar <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic">http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic</A>) 

indicates that the ontology at that URL is imported, but that the prefix
'ar#' is sufficient to identify words from its namespace. Such a local name
is considered to be part of the namespace of the ontology containing the
importing expression. The effect of such an importing expression is the same
as including the imported ontology with every nonlogical symbol #-prefixed
by the local name.  

MW: EXPRESS goes one step further than this and allows you to give a local
name to any element in the imported ontology - with a default of the same
name (somewhere between includes and imports).

MW: You introduce "#" as a name separator. This needs some official status
in KIF.


Importation is considered to be transitive, and the #-namespace convention
can be iterated; so for example if the ontology called arithmetic at
<A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic">http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic</A> contains an importing expression
'(imports it <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations">http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations</A>)' 

and the relation name 'succ' is used in the 'iterations'ontology, then this
relation may be referred to by the name 'it#succ' in arithmetic, and by the
name 'ar#it#succ' in any ontology which imports it with the local name 'ar',
ie which contains the expression  

MW: I don't understand why you would do this. It means that the same
ontology referred to from different places would have a different name path.
On the other hand, its own local name would be unchanged. Therefore this
seems both unnecessary and potentially confusing.

MW: The reason for putting namespaces into a namespace would be to be sure
you were talking about the same ontology with that name, e.g.
ISOTC184/SC4#4D-ontology#individual.

(imports ar <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic">http://www.frob.org/2000/arithmetic</A>). 


If an ontology at a URL includes another ontology , the included ontology
can be imported by using the #-prefix to refer to the included ontology. For
example, if the ontology at <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations">http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations</A> includes an
ontology form 

(ontology sequences ...) 

then the expression 

(imports seq <A  HREF="http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations#sequences">http://www.frob.org/2000/iterations#sequences</A>) 

will import just the sentences from the sequences ontology form, with the
prefix seq# added to all the words in that namespace.  

MW: I'm trying to think when you would want to do this, and failing. It
strikes me as dangerous to import part of an ontology, and then extend it in
some direction, providing an ideal mechanism for creating extended subsets
of something. If the pieces  really stand alone, then they should have been
developed like that, and if not ...


The KIF expression 

(imports foo &lt;URI&gt;) .... 

corresponds to the following fragment of DAML+OIL: 


&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:foo="&lt;URI&gt;#" &gt; 

&lt;daml:Ontology rdf:about=""&gt; 

&lt;daml:imports resource="&lt;URI&gt;" /&gt; 

&lt;/daml:Ontology&gt; 

.... 

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;  

MW: Well, I guess I think there is some more to do here. I have a slight
sense here, of solutions without clear requirements. Clearly, the general
objective is to allow some sort of modularisation, and not to force things
to be monolithic. But for example, why are namespaces tied to
import/include? Why can't they be managed separately? I think two things
have got mixed up, naming issues, and modularisation issues.

MW: Consider an alternative approach where you simply had for a module to
declare a default namespace. Now there is really no difference between
import and include. Include would just be where the same namespace was used
in the imported module, and import is just where the imported module had a
different namespace.

MW: Personally I think it would be good to keep structuring and naming
separate.
