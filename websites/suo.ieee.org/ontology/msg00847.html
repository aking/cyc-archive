&gt; &gt; &gt; My only addition is a suggestion that we use KIF
&gt; &gt; &gt; as the base language of signs for the purpose of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the SUO, and we define the terms in other languages,
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as English, conceptual graphs, etc., by their
&gt; &gt; &gt; translation to KIF.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I repeat my earlier caveat:  This proposal does
&gt; &gt; &gt; not solve any philosophical problems, it doesn't answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; any linguistic questions, and it makes no claim that KIF
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the best language for everything that one might want
&gt; &gt; &gt; to use a language for.  But it allows the work on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUO to proceed.

&gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; KIF, in the shape that we currently know it, and, for that matter,
&gt; &gt; most of the popular systems for expressing FOL, are not languages
&gt; &gt; that I can think in, for the reason that they preclude me, either
&gt; &gt; through their deliberate inexpressiveness or their computational
&gt; &gt; inefficiency, from being able to address the research issues that
&gt; &gt; are of pressing concern and present interest to me, like whether
&gt; &gt; the functional (procedural) and the logical (declarative) aspects
&gt; &gt; of computational (in the broadest sense) languages can be better
&gt; &gt; integrated than they currently are, just to name a single issue
&gt; &gt; that leaps to mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon, first let me thank you for expressing yourself with such clarity.
&gt; But to turn to the substance, I wonder what kind of limitation you find
&gt; in KIF?  KIF 3.0 (not ANSI-KIF, or the SUO-KIF core, both of which are
&gt; highly stripped down to their simplest basics) must be one of the most
&gt; expressive formal languages ever defined.  It is capable of describing
&gt; its own syntax (like LISP), it has the strongest consistent truth-predicate
&gt; I have ever seen, it has upward and downward reflection.  What more can you
&gt; possibly want?  (Higher-order quantifiers?  Type theory?)  I concede that it
&gt; might not be the most elegant language (although trying to do better has given
&gt; me a lot more respect for it:  designing elegant languages isn't an easy task),
&gt; but you don't criticise it on aesthetic grounds.  And for a Peircian, surely
&gt; it's having been aligned with CG's must give it some brownie points.
&gt; 
&gt; You say you are interested in integrating functional and declarative aspects
&gt; of languages, which is also a central interest of mine.  Even here, KIF is
&gt; worthy of a little careful study (although this goes way beyond what is
&gt; needed for the SUO enterprise, I believe).  For example, KIF 3.0 has
&gt; a basic semantic flaw which makes it not strictly first-order;
&gt; it assumes that sequences are finite, a constraint which is not
&gt; first-order expressible. But notice that this assumption *is*
&gt; expressible in the usual fixed-point semantics for recursive
&gt; programming languages, and would indeed validate the many
&gt; 'recursive' definitions in the KIF 3.0 manual.  So it seems
&gt; to me that KIF might indeed be a very good tree to try climbing
&gt; in order to get at this particular kind of research fruit.  Can
&gt; one give it a semantics which somehow combines what one wants of
&gt; the assertional expressive power of a quantified logic with some the
&gt; recursive power of a functional programming language?  How?  I honestly
&gt; do not know, but I think it would be well worth careful study.  Suppose one
&gt; could:  what then would happen to the self-description abilities of KIF, in
&gt; the light of this new semantics?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why would I want to be a part of building a language that
&gt; &gt; I myself would not use, could not use for any significant
&gt; &gt; purpose under the sun?  Why would I want to sell to others,
&gt; &gt; to impose on others, a language that they will have so much
&gt; &gt; trouble, with mechanized help or otherwise, using to think?
&gt; 
&gt; Can you tell us HOW this language is hampering our thinking,
&gt; in your view?  Or what sort of language might be less hampering?
&gt; I might be a lost cause, of course, having been thinking in,
&gt; and about, FOL most of my adult life.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I never know where any language might be capable of going over time,
&gt; &gt; and so the only features that I see worth criticizing in FOL or KIF
&gt; &gt; are the features that would keep them cast in stone, fixed in place,
&gt; &gt; or rooted to the spots that they currently inhabit.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, its true that the *language* doesnt have any intrinsic machinery
&gt; for changing itself (although it is possible, in principle, to express
&gt; in KIF's metatheory axioms which, when added to a knowledge base, will
&gt; extend the set of forms recognisable by the parser.  But I would have
&gt; to agree with anyone who would say this wasnt a very practical device.)
&gt; But the *ontology* expressed in the language is capable of being extended
&gt; and modified, and this is I think where the SUO effort should be focussed.
&gt; The particular language used in not in itself of deep importance, provided
&gt; that it has a certain basic expressive power: one can write translators
&gt; between various ontology languages.

Pat, &amp; All,

Well, I survived my endodontological (root-canal) procedure this morning
and so I am feeling emboldened enough to tackle this ontological abcess --
or is that just the novocaine talking?

I do not think that I can tell this story without indulging in some
personal history, along with a few bits from the history of logic --
as it appears from inside the Persean tradition, or, at least,
as seen by this one observer.

First, to get one mis-apprehension out of the way -- I just wish that
I had seen this earlier -- I'm not talking about more deductive power,
or not so far as fundamentals go, though efficiency is another matter,
so there will be no effort at one-up-machine-ship in this direction.

Indeed, I am perfectly content, ok, let's just say that I have accepted
the necessity, to work with far less powerful inference engines, so far
as their deductive horsepower goes, until such time as we can reinforce
the chassis of our reasoning vehicles -- can he keep the metaphor going,
you ask? -- in order to bear up reasonably well under the loads and the
stresses that are often placed on them in actual practice, under field
conditions, and in their endurance trials on the road of inquiry.

This req, this spec, requires more than sheer/shear deductive power.
It demands a reasonable respect for what at least one Persean calls
the "integrity of inquiry" (IOI).  But explaining that "respective"
may take me a while to do, and it may take your patience and your
tolerance for a view of logical history that may or may not be
entirely familiar to you.  I think I will go get some lunch,
take a tylenol, and think about how to do that.

Until Later,

Jon Awbrey
