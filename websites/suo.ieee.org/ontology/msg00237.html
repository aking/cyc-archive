Jim, 
	.	Further to my previous e-mails about SUO content, I am
wondering about adding health / community services related content (ie.
related to AIHW) from scratch. 

	.	I have already raised the issue of a map of areas to be
covered by the SUO, but still await any response. I suggest it is
appropriate to get some form of such guidance before expending what may
otherwise be nugatory effort. 

	.	Do you or anyone have a feel for the likely domains of high
level subject area coverage for the SUO. I believe we need to address this
before we can really start generating semantic, rather than structural /
logical / syntactic, content. 

	.	If people believe such content is beyond the scope of the
SUO, it would help if this issue could be argued through, so we can
understand where we are.

Subject:	SUO: Domain Ontologies

SUO,

I would like to start a thread to explore the initiation of one or more
SUO-compliant domain ontologies.  It may be premature to actually start
some, but it's not too soon to start exploring the subject.   
I see the following potential benefits to SUO:
1.	It will provide SUO with practical requirements.  It will also help
us understand what perhaps is not important.  [It should be noted that
commercial applications will also provide the SUO WG with both requirements
and non-requirements.]
2.	It may help speed up progress within SUO.
3.	It could help us recruit additional active participants.  
4.	Some early trial domain ontologies will help us learn how to deal
with larger domain ontologies later on.  We need to develop a common
language (an ontology?) for talking about the topic of domain ontologies.
We also need to learn how to deal with input from them.  We'll also need
learn how to deconflict content when it falls into multiple domains.  The
bottom line is that we have a lot to learn, so the sooner we get started the
better.
5.	It could start the process of SUO adoption, which we'll eventually
need.

Now obviously, SUO would need to have some rough version of a base document
before a domain ontology could start building content based upon it, but
other forms of prep work could probably get started while SUO is
crystalizing. 
I wonder if there are any members of SUO that already have a domain ontology
and would be willing to rework it based on KIF and SUO.  
Another idea might be for the SUO standard to actually include a small
domain ontology as a demonstration of how SUO interrelates with it.  Of
course, this would require volunteers willing to do this work.
What are some other issues?
Is there anyone willing to put some work into this?
Does anyone know of any domain groups that might be willing to be the first
SUO-based ontology?

[I'm starting this thread on the main list because I see it as core to the
success of SUO.]
[If this thread develops momentum, we'll probably split it off as a separate
list.]
