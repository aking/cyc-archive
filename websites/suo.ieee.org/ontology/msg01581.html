Nicola,
   I'd like to respond to the latter part of your message:

&gt;In practice, my proposal is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;1. Let's carefully (and painfully) distinguish between axioms and 
&gt;primitives that achieve (reasonably large) consensus and axioms/primitives 
&gt;that do not;
&gt;
&gt;2. When there is no consensus, let's isolate the alternatives and ask the 
&gt;supporters to i) explain, ii) motivate and iii) formalize both of them;
&gt;
&gt;3. If enough explanation/motivation/formalization is achieved (up to a 
&gt;certain minimal degree) for both alternatives, then:
&gt;    3.1 create a new branch in the ontology library
&gt;    3.2 go on specializing the two branches in parallel, depending on the 
&gt; interest they
&gt;        receive.
&gt;
&gt;4. Else proceed by considering only the alternative that was best 
&gt;explained, motivated, and formalized.

I agree completely with this process.  If there are theories that someone 
is willing to formalize, and they prove to be incompatible with other 
formalized theories then we'll be at a point where we can either get 
consensus to adopt one or agree to adopt both "branches" as alternatives.

I have some disagreement with the points you make earlier in your message 
but as long as we agree on the actual proposal, I should probably quit 
while I'm ahead! :-)

&gt;&gt;  Neither the approach of a single common ontology, or a catalog of 
&gt;&gt; related ontologies has been proven to be the right approach, so either 
&gt;&gt; or both may turn out to be valid.  However, I would say that a single 
&gt;&gt; common ontology, to the degree practical, is the goal of this group, and 
&gt;&gt; has been voted on when the PAR was approved.  I have found that there 
&gt;&gt; can be disagreement on wording that I thought was very clear, but the 
&gt;&gt; sections that seem to indicate this are (with my emphasis by bracketing 
&gt;&gt; with '*'s):
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"This standard will specify *an* upper ontology that will enable 
&gt;&gt;computers..."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange format whereby 
&gt;&gt;owners of existing applications will be able to map existing data 
&gt;&gt;elements just *once to a common ontology*."
&gt;
&gt;Dear Adam,
&gt;
&gt;         I agree that - strictly speaking - the former statement above 
&gt; (but not the latter!) is incompatible with a non-monolythic approach 
&gt; (just because I assume that *an* ontology should be described by a 
&gt; consistent logical theory). I think however that the practical goal of 
&gt; our enterprise would remain mainly the same if we adopt a broader 
&gt; perspective, replacing "an upper ontology" with something like "A 
&gt; framework of carefully crafted foundational ontologies". In practice, 
&gt; such a framework would be a set of logical theories ordered according to 
&gt; a theory-inclusion relationship, as proposed (I believe) by Chris Menzel. 
&gt; The formal structure would be similar to that of the Stanford Ontology 
&gt; Library, or to the ONIONS ontology. Differently from these approaches, 
&gt; the SUO would explicitly account for a (hopefully limited) set of 
&gt; well-documented ontological alternatives, to be selected by the various 
&gt; applications that want to "plug in" the SUO.
&gt;
&gt;         Ideally, the SUO interface should offer the new user a "menu" of 
&gt; i) well-documented, ii) reasonably formalized, and iii) sufficiently 
&gt; agreed on ontological choices to choose from. On the basis of this 
&gt; choice, the interface would select the right set of SUO modules.
&gt;
&gt;         In my opinion, this approach would be perfectly consistent with 
&gt; the latter statement above: the goal is to have a standardized semantic 
&gt; framework to be used to understand and relate each other the intended 
&gt; meaning of data elements, not so much to force data elements to commit to 
&gt; the same semantics!
&gt;
&gt;         Moreover, the non-monolithic architecture is the only way to 
&gt; guarantee the high coverage of our initiative, which otherwise would 
&gt; necessarily exclude important players. For example, consider the 
&gt; community of so-called "linguistic" ontologies, explicitly "dismissed" by 
&gt; the recent Pat's messages... I believe it would be *essential*, for the 
&gt; purpose of the SUO, to be able to include linguistically-motivated domain 
&gt; ontologies in the SUO framework. In some cases, this may imply to adopt 
&gt; ontological commitments that are just incompatible with those useful for, 
&gt; say, nuclear physics ontology...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I would say that Cyc falls somewhere in the middle on this issue and I 
&gt;&gt;suspect that will be the result for the SUO as well - a largely common 
&gt;&gt;ontology with a context mechanism that allows for a few different, 
&gt;&gt;although compatible, approaches in limited areas.
&gt;
&gt;I believe that an alternative could be a "minimal" common ontology with a 
&gt;few main branches, which in turn may have more specialized branches in 
&gt;limited areas. Of course, the less branches the better.
&gt;
&gt;In practice, my proposal is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;1. Let's carefully (and painfully) distinguish between axioms and 
&gt;primitives that achieve (reasonably large) consensus and axioms/primitives 
&gt;that do not;
&gt;
&gt;2. When there is no consensus, let's isolate the alternatives and ask the 
&gt;supporters to i) explain, ii) motivate and iii) formalize both of them;
&gt;
&gt;3. If enough explanation/motivation/formalization is achieved (up to a 
&gt;certain minimal degree) for both alternatives, then:
&gt;    3.1 create a new branch in the ontology library
&gt;    3.2 go on specializing the two branches in parallel, depending on the 
&gt; interest they
&gt;        receive.
&gt;
&gt;4. Else proceed by considering only the alternative that was best 
&gt;explained, motivated, and formalized.
&gt;
&gt;Note that this proposal obviously reflects a top-down approach, but I 
&gt;believe it can be adapted also to the middle-out approach advocated by 
&gt;Mike Uschold, as long as we are ready to create a new upper-level branch 
&gt;while generalizing from a certain middle-level view that turns out to be 
&gt;incompatible with the previously developed ontology.
