1.3.4.14  Application of OF:  Generic Level (cont.)

In order to deal with the array of issues presented so far in this Subsection,
all of which have to do with controlling the generative power of sign relations
to serve the specific purposes of understanding, I apply the previously introduced
concept of an &quot;objective genre&quot; (OG).  This is intended to be a determinate purpose
or a deliberate pattern of analysis and synthesis that one can identify as being
active at given moments in a discussion and that affects what one regards as
the relevant structural properties of its objects.

In the remainder of this Subsection the concept of an OG is used informally,
and only to the extent that it is needed for a pressing application, namely,
to rationalize the natural kinds that are claimed for signs and to clarify
an important contrast that exists between icons and indices.

The OG I apply here is called the &quot;genre of properties and instances&quot;.
One moves through its space, higher and lower in a particular ontology,
by means of two 2-adic relations, upward by taking a &quot;property of&quot; and
downward by taking an &quot;instance of&quot; whatever object initially enters
one's focus of attention.  Each object of this OG is reckoned to be
the unique common property of the set of objects that lie one step
below it, objects that are in turn reckoned to be instances of the
given object.

Pretty much the same relational patterns could be found in the genre or
the paradigm of &quot;qualities and examples&quot;, but the use of &quot;examples&quot; here
is polymorphous enough to include experiential, exegetic, and executable
examples (EXE's).  This points the way to a series of related genres, for
example, the OG's of &quot;principles and illustrations&quot;, &quot;laws and existents&quot;,
&quot;precedents and exercises&quot;, or on to &quot;lessons and experiences&quot;.  All in all,
as things work out in their respective turns, these modulations of the same
basic OG show a way to shift the foundations of ontological hierarchies
toward bases in individual and systematic experience, and thus to put
existentially dynamic rollers under the blocks of what all too often
appear to be essentially invariant pyramids, even when they are not.

Any object of these OG's can be contemplated in the light of two
potential relationships, namely, with respect to its chances of
being an &quot;object quality&quot; (OQ) or an &quot;object example&quot; (OE) of
something else.  In future references, abbreviated notations
like &quot;OG(Prop, Inst)&quot; or &quot;OG = &lt;Prop, Inst&gt;&quot; will be used to
specify particular genres, in this sketchy but suggestive
way serving to adumbrate the intended interpretations of
their generating relations {-&lt;- , -&gt;-}.

With respect to this OG, I can now characterize icons and indices:

| Icons are signs by virtue of being instances of properties of objects.
|
| Indices are signs by virtue of being properties of instances of objects.

Because the initial discussion seems to flow more smoothly if I apply
2-adic relations on the left, I formulate these definitions as follows:

| For Icons:     Sign(Obj)  =  Inst(Prop(Obj)).
|
| For Indices:   Sign(Obj)  =  Prop(Inst(Obj)).

Imagine starting from the sign and retracing steps to reach the object,
in this way finding the converses of these relations to be as follows:

| For Icons:     Obj(Sign)  =  Inst(Prop(Sign)).
|
| For Indices:   Obj(Sign)  =  Prop(Inst(Sign)).

In spite of the apparent duality that is manifested between these patterns
of composition, there is nevertheless a significant asymmetry to be observed
in the way that the insistent theme of realism interrupts the underlying genre.
In order to understand this, it is necessary to note that the strain of pragmatic
thinking I am using here takes its definition of &quot;reality&quot; from the word's original
Scholastic sources, where the adjective &quot;real&quot; means &quot;having properties&quot;.  Taken in
this sense, reality is necessary but not sufficient to &quot;actuality&quot;, where &quot;actual&quot;
means &quot;existing in act and not merely potentially&quot; (Webster's).  To reiterate,
actuality is sufficient but not necessary to reality.  The difference between
the ideas is further pointed up by the fact that a potential can be real,
and that its reality can be independent of any particular moment in
which the power acts.

These &quot;angelic doctrines&quot; would probably remain distant from
the present concern, were it not for two points of connection:

1.  Relative to the present genre, the distinction of reality,
    that can be granted to certain objects of thought and not
    to others, fulfills an analogous role to the distinction
    that singles out &quot;sets&quot; among &quot;classes&quot; in modern versions
    of set theory.  Taking the membership relation &quot;element of&quot;
    as a predecessor relation in a pre-designated hierarchy of
    classes, a class attains the status of a set, and by dint
    of this becomes an object of a more determinate discussion,
    simply if it has successors.  In contrast, pragmatic reality
    is distinguished from both the medieval and the modern versions
    by the circumstance that its reality is always a reality to somebody.
    This is due to the circumstance that it takes both an abstract property
    and a concrete interpreter to establish the practical reality of an object.

2.  This project seeks articulations and implementations of intelligent activity
    within dynamically realistic systems.  The individual stresses that were just
    now placed on articulation, implementation, actuality, dynamics, and reality
    collectively reinforce the importance of several issues:

    a.  Systems theory, consistently pursued, eventually demands for its
        rationalization a distinct ontology, one in which states of being
        and modes of action form the principal objects of thought, out of
        which the ordinary sorts of stably extended but derivative objects
        must be constructed.  In the &quot;grammar&quot; of process philosophy, verbs
        and pronouns are more basic than nouns.  In its influence on the
        course of this discussion, the emphasis on systematic action is
        tantamount to the constitution of an objective genre that makes
        dynamic systems, their momentary states and their passing actions,
        become the ultimate objects of synthesis and analysis.  Consequently,
        the drift of this inquiry will be turned toward conceiving actions,
        as traced out in the trajectories of systems, to be the primitive
        elements of construction, in this objective genre more fundamental
        than the customary arrays of stationary objects extended in space.
        As a corollary, one now expects to find that physical objects of
        the static variety have a derivative status in relation to the
        activities that orient agents, both organisms and organizations,
        toward purposeful objectives.

    b.  At root, the notion of &quot;dynamics&quot; is concerned with &quot;power&quot;, in
        the original sense of &quot;potential&quot;.  The brand of pragmatic thought
        that I use in this work permits potential entities to be analyzed
        as real objects and it finds conceptual objects to be constituted
        by the conception of their actual effects in practical instances.
        In the ongoing endeavor to unify symbolic and dynamic approaches
        to intelligent systems (Upper and Lower Kingdoms?), there remains
        an insistent need to build conceptual bridges between these realms.
        A facility for relating objects to their actualizing instances and
        their instantiating actions lends many useful tools to an effort of
        this nature, in which the search for understanding cannot rest until
        each object and each phenomenon has been reconstructed in terms of
        active occurrences and ways of being.

    c.  In prospect of form, it does not matter whether one conceives this
        project as a task of analyzing and articulating the actualizations
        of intelligence that already exist in nature, or whether one views
        its object to be one of synthesizing and artificing the potentials
        for intelligence that have yet to be conceived in practice.  Taken
        from a formal perspective, the analysis and the synthesis are just
        reciprocal ways of tracing and retracing the same generic patterns
        of potential structure that determine actual form.
