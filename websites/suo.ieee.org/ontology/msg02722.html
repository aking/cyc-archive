Matthew,
   I for one would welcome any proposal for a Reference Ontology whether it 
is an extension of, or completely different from the Merged Ontology that 
Ian and I have proposed.  I believe that once the group focuses on a 
particular formal ontology (or several) that we will be doing relevant work 
and that it will be much easier to see and resolve the real issues.

&gt;
&gt;My experience is obviously a bit different. Firstly the work we
&gt;have done in Shell and EPISTLE over the last 10 years has been
&gt;largely middle out, and we have made a major change to the top
&gt;at least once on our journey when we moved to a 4D approach.
&gt;However, if you start from the middle, you do get to some (one
&gt;or more) top. Having got there our experience is that this
&gt;can be very useful in almost every situation as at a minimum a
&gt;basis for analysis. I.e. trying to place the concepts of the
&gt;requirements at hand into the upper ontology (data model in our
&gt;case) and just asking the questions you need to do that has
&gt;been valuable both in improving the quality and the compatibility
&gt;of the systems delivered.
&gt;
&gt;Our experience is even that using a not very good upper level
&gt;model, or only using it partly is better than using none at
&gt;all.
&gt;
&gt;However, that is a bit different from having a "standard" ontology
&gt;with the intention that everyone uses it. I think we might do
&gt;better to develop one or more Reference ontologies of different
&gt;flavours with a mapping between. But I have said this before
&gt;and may propose it formally in a short while.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I could not agree more with Nicola's comment regarding the
&gt; &gt; conduct of the SUO list. I disagree with Jim that "Our
&gt; &gt; problem has been lack of something to focus on."  Oh
&gt; &gt; contrairre. There are countless worthy issues to focus on.
&gt; &gt; The lack of progress, as Nicola suggests is due to the
&gt; &gt; general unwillingness of the group to focus on a few issues
&gt; &gt; at a time, to make and record progress, etc. And of course,
&gt; &gt; not to stray willy nilly into topics of little relevance.
&gt; &gt; There was a perfect opportunity to record progress by having
&gt; &gt; papers submitted to SUO - this was not taken up. I am not
&gt; &gt; pointing blame anywhere, for I also failed to contribute a
&gt; &gt; paper, due to other priorities.  I regret that the signal to
&gt; &gt; noise ratio does not allow me to participate as I would like
&gt; &gt; to. I regret missing out on some of the truly excellent
&gt; &gt; discussions from which I learn a lot, most particularly due
&gt; &gt; to Pat Hayes' prolific contributions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; While I am on a roll...  I also tend to agree with many of
&gt; &gt; the points Pat  has made recently, which unfortunately point
&gt; &gt; to the apparent fact that there is no compelling evidence
&gt; &gt; that a STANDARD UO will be of value. I'm not even sure of the
&gt; &gt; value of any UO, in most contexts. I heartily agree that
&gt; &gt; starting from the top is not a good way to get a USEFUL
&gt; &gt; ontology, as I have argued many times.  Our experience in
&gt; &gt; applying the enterprise ontology (which from the perspective
&gt; &gt; of our application, was a very abstract Upperish Level
&gt; &gt; Ontology for enterprise concepts) was that there was only one
&gt; &gt; case where it was even possible to connect to concepts in the
&gt; &gt; EO, and there was no real benefit in doing this. There is a
&gt; &gt; huge gaping gulf between application-specific ontologies and
&gt; &gt; upper level ones, and it is not only difficult to bridge the
&gt; &gt; gap, there seems to be no point in doing so.  I agree with
&gt; &gt; Pat that one needs to start in the MIDDLE where the real
&gt; &gt; action is, in one's given domain. Then, !
&gt; &gt; on!
&gt; &gt; !
&gt; &gt;  a demand-pull basis, add upperish-level concepts as they are
&gt; &gt; required.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On the other hand, I am not so confident as Pat that the
&gt; &gt; whole effort is a waste, and doomed to fail. Having a SINGLE
&gt; &gt; upper ontology, may well fail, but having components to
&gt; &gt; choose from may well be useful. I still have a sense that the
&gt; &gt; way to proceed is as follows for a given domain, at whatever level.
&gt; &gt; 1. Identify important concepts.
&gt; &gt; 2. identify different ways to model them
&gt; &gt; 3. Split the differences into two categories:
&gt; &gt; a. Those that are superficial, and are mere choices with
&gt; &gt; minimal consequence, all may have the same models, for example.
&gt; &gt; b. Those that are IMPORTANT - such as those identified by Pat
&gt; &gt; in his survey of time representations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. For the non-important differences, choose one that seems
&gt; &gt; to work,even if it is arbitrary. Anyone who does not like it,
&gt; &gt; can choose to use their own, and map to/from it.
&gt; &gt; 5. For the important ones, develop independent and presumably
&gt; &gt; incompatible theories which one can choose from.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; None of this is necessarily new, having been said by various
&gt; &gt; folk in varous ways.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will stop this less than well-articulated ramble...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nicola,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       The message volume has not been the cause of our lack
&gt; &gt; of progress,
&gt; &gt; it has just filled the void.  Our problem has been lack of
&gt; &gt; something to
&gt; &gt; focus on.  Only one starter document has been proposed and
&gt; &gt; the group did not
&gt; &gt; accept it (though it did pass in a straw poll).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       Others have posted work, as you have, but have not been
&gt; &gt; willing to
&gt; &gt; actually propose it as a group effort, probably because they
&gt; &gt; didn't have the
&gt; &gt; time or resources to champion it any further.  This is
&gt; &gt; understandable, but a
&gt; &gt; standard will only be developed if it has a core group
&gt; &gt; willing to champion
&gt; &gt; it all the way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       Unless we have this key ingredient, no measure of good
&gt; &gt; management
&gt; &gt; will lead this group to success.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;Nicola,

&gt; &gt; &gt;     Have you given any further thought to submitting any of
&gt; &gt; your work as
&gt; &gt; &gt;a starter document for SUO.  As you know, the group needs one or more
&gt; &gt; &gt;documents to focus its efforts on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dear James,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       The paper we have submitted to the IJCAI SUO Workshop (which
&gt; &gt; will be presented at the IJCAI ws on ontologies) cannot be intended
&gt; &gt; as a starter ontology, but can certainly be considered among the
&gt; &gt; starter documents. There is no attempt to be complete, though. A
&gt; &gt; preliminary version of our IKF reference ontology is scheduled by the
&gt; &gt; end of this year, and we should able to announce a  preliminary
&gt; &gt; top-level before Summer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       A further (indirect) contribution is my recent review of
&gt; &gt; Sowa's book and especially his top-level ontology. Since the current
&gt; &gt; merged ontology is based on it, this is implicitly a criticism to the
&gt; &gt; merged ontology. I have no time for an open, endless discussion on
&gt; &gt; this, but I will certainly welcome specific, focused observations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       In the meanwhile, our own contribution to the SUO initiative
&gt; &gt; will necessarily be very limited, mainly because of the fact that
&gt; &gt; this group hasn't been able to implement a strict issue-based
&gt; &gt; discussion methodology, nor the "bookshelf of results" proposed in
&gt; &gt; the past by Mike Uschold and myself. To me, the inhability of
&gt; &gt; achieving this and the lack of control of out-of-focus discussions on
&gt; &gt; the list reveals a serious failure of this initiative. This is also
&gt; &gt; the reason of my abstension regarding the Chair elections.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       A further reason of disappointment is the way the IEEE SUO
&gt; &gt; workshop has been managed. Still I don't know how many papers have
&gt; &gt; been submitted and selected. I suspect that ours was the only paper.
&gt; &gt; This could have been a useful opportunity to force people to condense
&gt; &gt; their proposals in papers, but apparently it didn't work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       That's it, for now. I will be more active when this list will
&gt; &gt; be more efficient, and when a list of issues and proposals, with
&gt; &gt; defenders and opponents for each of them, will be posted on the Web
&gt; &gt; site. I know it is difficult, but it is the only way to proceed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Best wishes,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -- Nicola
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; P.S.: I am answering to you only since you sent me a personal
&gt; &gt; message; I encourage you to forward this to the whole list, however.
