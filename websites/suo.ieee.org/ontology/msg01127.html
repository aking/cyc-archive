Pat,


*Set*

Maybe we should just agree to differ on set.

I dispute your claim "The very word "set" as used throughout mathematics and
logic
*means* something which is abstract and not spatiotemporally located
in this sense. This is what "set" means in Tarskian model theory and
in all the axiomatic set theories."

Max Black's essay (referred to in an earlier email) starts with a quote from
a working mathematician's book on set theory - which claims that packs of
wolves etc. are standard examples of sets. If I had the time, I am sure I
could come up with other examples. I suspect that most (many?) working
mathematicians do not bother considering whether sets are 'abstract' or
spatio-temporally located. They will be happy to (loosely) say packs of
wolves or other collections can be considered as sets, if they find this
intuitively useful. Logicians are trained to play a different language game.

*collection*

You suggest talking to Nicola.
I have done so and he takes a similar position to Matthew (and me).
He only uses fusions/mereo-sums as a basis for his notion of collections -
and so avoids the problems of having to engineer the relationships between a
distinct collection category and the category of sets and fusions. He places
the burden of capturing what we mean by collection on the notion of a
privileged part - and the notion of a whole.

Returning to the art collection example - to illustrate the Guarino/West
approach. The Wallace collection would be a collection of painting say,
originally owned by Wallace. So the Wallace collection would be the fusion
of the paintings, where these paintings had a privileged part relation,
which would be something like 'part of &amp; part is a painting &amp; painting is
now part of Wallace collection'. If the Wallace collection was one of, of
many, in the National Collection, then the National Collection would be both
the fusion of the paintings in the collection and the fusion of the
collections. There would be two sets of privileged parts - one relating the
National Collection to its constituent collections and another relating it
to its constituent paintings. Note: though the part of relation is
transitive, the privileged subsets of the part of are not - transitivity
being a property of a set of relations.

The question of sets (or at least finite sets of physical objects) comes in
when we want to start distributing the properties among the categories.
While we are happy letting weight and volume apply to (some) physical
objects - and not to sets - i.e. restricting it to the category of physical
objects. It seems less convenient to do let number also apply to this
category. The problem is (as Frege among others have pointed out) that if we
let number apply to physical objects we have to qualify it. In the example
above, the National Collection will have a number C of collections as its
art-collection 'members' and a number P of paintings as its paintings
'members'. It seems easier (from an engineering point of view) to let these
counting numbers apply to sets - without qualification. (I have discussed
this point with Nicola, who says he can see the point of it). [NB. Another
option which would give you unique counting is having a new ontological
type, collection, which is also concrete.]

Chris

  Chris Partridge &lt;chris_partridge@csi.com&gt;:
&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;In any normal enterprise there is an attempt (maybe feeble) to follow a
&gt;strategy - where the major options are identified (as far a spossible), and
&gt;the costs and benefits of them weighed, and a choice made. Once the broad
&gt;framework is established the details are worked out. It is unusual for the
&gt;strategy to be undertaken with an assumption that there is only one possibl
e
&gt;route.
&gt;
&gt;My general point - made a number of times - is that we face a similar
&gt;situation with regard to ontologies. There is no one absolute right answer.
&gt;That there are a number of strategic options to be made in the ontological
&gt;architecture. As in most enterprises these are tangled - a choice of one
&gt;option influences the others. A point you, I and others have made a number
&gt;of times.
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me that there are two extremes in the positions one can take.
&gt;One can say that there is only one right way - mine - and all others are
&gt;inconsistent. Or one can say here are the range of options - and the
reasons
&gt;for picking one or the other. At this stage I think the second position can
&gt;be a useful one to take.

I agree about ontologies, but I have been protesting about your use
of technical terminology (particularly "set") in our mutual
metalangauge, not about ontological strategies.

&gt;Even after the event of making the choice, as it
&gt;can rationalize why the choice was made. So, my efforts are directed at
&gt;trying to make the strategic architectural options clear, so that we are at
&gt;least making an informed choice. And, in particular, as we are after a SUO
&gt;and not just a SO, to show where a option is attractive locally, it has
&gt;implications globally.
&gt;
&gt;In this context, regarding abstractness - my general point is that people
&gt;use the notion of abstract in a number of different ways. For it to be
&gt;useful as a category in an ontology it needs to be defined reasonably well.
&gt;My basic point is that you cannot (maybe should not?) start with the
&gt;following:
&gt;
&gt;1. There is an important disjoint distinction between concrete and abstract
&gt;objects.
&gt;2. Abstract objects are one's with no spatio-temporal location - whereas
&gt;concrete one's do.
&gt;3. Sets are abstract objects.
&gt;4. Sets have a spatio-temporal location.
&gt;
&gt;You quite clearly do not favour 4

My point is not that I do not favor 4 as what might be called an
ontological option (although indeed I don't), but a rather stronger
point about the language that we are using to conduct this discussion
in. The very word "set" as used throughout mathematics and logic
*means* something which is abstract and not spatiotemporally located
in this sense. This is what "set" means in Tarskian model theory and
in all the axiomatic set theories. Ordinary-language philosophers
(like Simons, and maybe yourself?) treat such facts with disdain, but
when we are engaged in trying to construct a formal ontology, a
certain basic respect for the mathematical tools we are proposing to
use seems to me to be a prerequisite for making progress.  Not to use
the formally defined terminology in our own discussions is rather
like engineers arguing about the real meaning of 'energy'. The fact
the people say they are running out of energy when they get tired
isn't a good argument against the energy  conservation law: it is a
good argument, however, for the irrelevance of natural language usage
for engineering. I see our enterprise here as more like engineering
than linguistic analysis.

CP&gt; I certainly agree with your last point. See above for my answer to your
first points.

&gt;- and you also, it seems, recognize an
&gt;ontological category of collections (groups, pluralities, or whatever) in
&gt;addition to mereosums/fusions and sets. Where these collections are
concrete
&gt;and so spatio-temporal. It also seems that you seem to favour a spectrum of
&gt;types of thing - with sets and fusions as two extremes.
&gt;
&gt;However this is not the only option. Matthew - it seems to me - wants to be
&gt;less ontologically promiscuous and only have fusions and sets in his
&gt;ontology. However, this position needs to 'explain' seemingly concrete
&gt;collections - such as football teams and piles of bolts.

I agree that is an option. What is not an option, however, is to give
sets a spatiotemporal location. That is simply an error. As nobody
but yourself, as far as I know, has ever on this list even suggested
this as an option, you seem to be producing more heat than light on
this particular point (though not in many other areas, I hasten to
add.)

&gt;As you do not like Lewis - let me try Simons - Parts - p.145.
&gt;"A class of several concrete individuals is itself a concrete particular,
&gt;though not a concrete individual. This conception of classes, as 'low-brow'
&gt;collections rather than 'high-brow' individuals fits the linguistic
&gt;phenomenon of plural reference rather than the requirements of foundations
&gt;of mathematics."

Yes, but this quote could be misleading if taken out of context.
Simons, notice, is here referring to plural reference, where one says
something of a 'class' distributively, thereby saying something about
all its members at once and collectively. In this sense of 'class' -
where, as Simons notes, the word is being used not in the
mathematical sense, but 'low-brow' - there is *no* ontological
commitment to the actual existence of the 'class' as an entity: it is
used only as a linguistic device, as a way of referring to its
members. In other words, Simons here is not in fact talking about
classes *at all* in the 'high-brow' sense that we have been
discussing them. (The phenomenon of plural reference is yet one more
reason why one should be extremely careful in drawing any ontological
consequences from linguistic intuitions, by the way.)
CP&gt; Pat, I have checked Simons and he specifically says he is talking about
pluralities not plural reference (p.144 Section 4.4 Pluralities ... the
first sentence - "... a more difficult question is whether there are plural
objects".
CP&gt; I accept that plural reference is a strategy, but it seems to me to just
move the problem from the ontology to the semantics - rather than just
solving it. A form of local nominalism - and here I agree with John Sowa's
point of some time ago that it makes sense to, at least, start with realism.


&gt;Or John Sowa - who quotes Lenat and Guha (Cyc) as saying they "intermix the
&gt;usage of collection, set and category".

I believe that you will find that whatever they say, that CYC in fact
has a pretty carefully maintained distinction between abstract sets
(it calls them 'collection', but that is just terminology) and
spatiotemporal entities.

&gt;It seems to me that a key test for distinguishing the two positions and
&gt;illustrating the costs and benefits is plural reference (i.e. collections)

This seems to me to be wholly confused. Plural reference makes no
ontological committment to collections: that is the point of it. If
collections exist as entities, the theoretical concept of 'plural
reference' becomes redundant: it is (ordinary) reference to the
collection.


CP&gt; I agree - I was speaking loosely.
&gt;I will take the liberty of calling the two positions - Pat's and Matthew's
&gt;(without meaning to commit you to them :)):
&gt;
&gt;Pat's Position:
&gt;Pro    - direct explanation of linguistic plural reference.

I wouldnt make this claim, I think you are confused about plural
reference, and in any case I don't give a damn about explaining
anything linguistic. We aren't in a linguistic business here.

CP&gt; Maybe a better phrasing would have been - linguistic talk about
pluralities.

&gt;Con    - admits more basic ontological entities - groups etc.

I would list this as a Pro. I think your taste for 'parsimony' is a
fatal flaw at this stage of the game.

&gt;Con    - additional complexity due to accounting for rules for combinations
of
&gt;different types of 'collection' - this is particularly acute if you take
the
&gt;spectrum rather than three types route.

This analysis needs to be done somehow, in any scheme. The situation
just is complex. Some collections relate to the things 'in' them
differently from others. Either one can set out to list and catalog
these distinctions, or one can seek to derive them from some
parimonious, elegant underlying model. A good methodology, I believe,
is to initially adopt what might be called the botanical stance, ie
to list and catalog, and then later, when the cataloging is done, to
try to find some general principles.  To succeed at doing the theory
first one needs to be either extremely lucky or a genius.

CP&gt; I think your first point is not right. It seems to me that if we
introduce collections as a new kind of object, then we have to explain what
a set of collections are, what a collection of sets is - if that is allowed,
what a collection of collections is - if that is allowed. But it seems to me
that we are describing a whole structural framework, which we do not need -
it is unnecessary complexity. What on earth would we want to use the notion
of a set of some collections for?
CP&gt; I agree with reservations, which I think you may also have. One can just
describe the surface phenomenon of language (or whatever), but it seems to
me to be more useful to try and understand the purpose of the distinctions
one is finding.

&gt;Matthew's position
&gt;Pro    - ontologically parsimonious
&gt;Pro    - simple, straight-forward rules for combination.

That would be a pro if it were correct. I don't think it is, however.
CP&gt; Why not? As in the example at the beginning, a collection of collections
just involves a fusion. What problems do you see?


&gt;Con    - less direct explanation of linguistic plural reference.
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me that we should be trying to identify the different possible
&gt;positions and the potential benefits and pitfalls of each (I note in
passing
&gt;that this is something in which philosophers can sometimes help - though of
&gt;course their scruples may sometimes bear no relation to practical issues -
&gt;and so, maybe, can be ignored)

OK. BUt I note that 'pats position' in fact is weaker than 'matthews
position', since the former says there are many kinds of collection,
including set and fusion, while the latter says that there are only
set and fusion and the others can be reduced to these. Maybe the
second view is correct, but one good way to approach it might be to
adopt the first view as a weaker working hypothesis, and have someone
who espouses the second view provide the defining translations in
terms of set and fusion which would justify the second view. The only
cost would be a larger working conceptual vocabulary, which people
are probably going to want in any case, in practice.

CP&gt; As I pointed out above, it seems to me that the 'larger vocabulary'
would include a range of construction that are never used - and would never
need to be used. But I would be interested in counter-examples. It seems to
me that the notion that we are talking about collections as a different
category of entity is one that the surface of the language seems to give
credence to. And, like you, I think language can mislead.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I presume you would analyse each of these as two statements about two
&gt; &gt;different but intimately related things:
&gt; &gt;So 'those two hundred bolts weigh 2 kilo' is really saying - that class
of
&gt; &gt;bolts has 200 members and the fusion of the members weighs 2 kilo.
&gt;
&gt;The thing that weighs 2 kilo is presumably something that when put
&gt;onto a scale would register 2 kilo. That would be something like a
&gt;pile of bolts. A pile is an example of an aggregate which is both a
&gt;material assembly (in contrast to a set) and has distinguished
&gt;members - it imposes individuation criteria on its members, so they
&gt;are countable - in contrast to a mereosum. It is neither a set nor a
&gt;mereosum. It shares countability with the set of its members, and
&gt;total mass with the mereosum of its members, but not vice versa.
&gt;CP: A good description of an aggregate - which is neither a class/set nor a
&gt;physical particular. So, I deduce that you have an ontology that includes
&gt;this.

I dont HAVE such an ontology. I think that any generally useful
physical ontology will need to include this, and a number of other
distinct notions of 'collection', in it. I also think that Nicola G's
overall picture of what is needed to characterise a kind of
collection is the best Ive seen so far, and suggests a
general-purpose notion which has set and mereosum as two 'extremes',
but also includes flocks, piles, shoals and other similar thingies.

CP&gt; See comments on Nicola's approach above. I think your position is
interesting (academically) and I await Ian Niles' attempt to axiomatise the
rules for combination - with, hopefully, examples of their uses. However, my
experience tells me that, from an engineering point of view, it is
unnecessarily complex.
