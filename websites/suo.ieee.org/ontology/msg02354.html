Techniques of "datamining" databases in order to discover hidden
relationships have usually been applied to data that is already
highly structured.  But some biologists have applied a keyword
technique to analyzing published papers:  search for coocurrence
patterns of words, in particular the names of genes that happen
to be mentioned in the same publication, create a network of
patterns, and search for promising relationships.

This kind of test does not require any kind of deep understanding,
but it has proved to be effective in discovering new patterns that
hadn't previously been noticed.  Such techniques have been applied
to many other kinds of natural language data, and they can be
considered a useful tool that can often find interesting patterns.

Following is a reference that gives a brief description:

And following is the web site, which continas the PubGene network
and the progamming tools, which are used to scan the literature and
generate networks that show the clusters:

And following are a few excerpts from the article.

Most scientific papers are now published online,
but there's no way any person could sift through
all of them. "It's beyond human cognition," says
geneticist Daniel Masys from the University of
California in San Diego. 

So Eivind Hovig of the Norwegian Radium Hospital
in Norway and his colleagues designed a computer
program to do the job. They based their method
on one simple assumption: if two genes are
mentioned in the same paper, they must be
biologically related.

The program scans through the titles and
abstracts of scientific papers and picks out names
of human genes. The researchers used it to search
over 10 million papers on the publicly available
database MEDLINE. 

They found references to 13,712 different human
genes and built up a network of which genes were
likely to be related. Then they annotated the gene
network with potential biological functions using
the keywords or subject headings associated with
each paper.

The result was a database called PubGene. For
any particular gene, the researchers can call up a
list of other genes it is likely to interact with, in
order of probability, and a list of medical areas in
which that gene is likely to be involved. This
information gives researchers a valuable head
start when they are planning their research.

PubGene predicted which genes were likely to be
related seven times better than random selection.
When tested against other databases for a limited
number of genes it only came up with about half
the number of interactions that we know about
from other methods, such as lab experiments. But
it did come up with some relationships that hadn't
been predicted before, and that were
subsequently found to be real.

The ultimate goal of scientists trying to analyse
biological information is to have computers that
can read and understand scientific papers in an
intelligent way. "The holy grail is for a computer
to be able to read an article like you or I would
read it and extract the concepts and relate them
all to each other," says Masys. "But we haven't
yet got anywhere close to that automated understanding."
