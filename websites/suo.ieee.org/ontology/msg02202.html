&gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  OK well let me first try to state a method,
&gt; &gt; &gt;      you will have to forgive some lack of formality,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If it can be formalized, I will help you to formalize it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;      but it should not be so unclear what I mean.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  My optimism never ceases to amaze me!

Of course, I probably could have continued to continue my sequence
of "moderately intelligent and well-informed guesses" (MIAWIG's),
but I get a bit edgy doing that in a case like this, and in many
cases, you see what happens -- people end up with a tangled web
of deceptive impressions of understanding each other -- and so
I have learned to distrust my openly operative optimiasm, too,
when it gets down to the nitty-gritty of any semiotic process.

&gt; &gt; &gt;      Where I come from this method would be
&gt; &gt; &gt;      informally known as reification.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Gasp!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Purpose:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; To take any n-adic relation occurence and turn it
&gt; &gt; &gt; into n binary relations without loss of meaning.

I did not notice on my first parse that you use this
phrase "n-adic relation occurrence" here, too, right
at the outset.  I guess that the first time I read
it I took it as "an example of an n-adic relation",
and not as "an n-tuple in an n-adic relation".
Which do you mean it to be?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Method:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Create an object (say x) that stands
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the n-adic relation as a whole.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is x what we would call a "relation name"?
&gt; &gt; It is the phrase "stands for" that makes
&gt; &gt; me think this.  If not, why not just say
&gt; &gt; that x is an n-adic relation?  When you
&gt; &gt; say "relation as a whole" do you mean
&gt; &gt; a set of n-tuples?  If so, can we then
&gt; &gt; say that x is a set of n-tuples?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  x replaces the tuple rather than a relation.
&gt;      So x replaces &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; This does not mean that x = &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; there is a relationship, but it is one of
&gt; derivability rather than equality.

The words "derive" and "derivability" are dear technical terms for me,
though it is true they are terms of art in at least three arts I know.
So unless you can define yet another new meaning for them for me, or
else relate their sense to you to some of those that I already know,
I am afraid that we are back to square one, if a little off base.
Personally, I had the impression, though it might be illusory,
of course, of having understood you better when you used the
phrase "Create an object (say x) that 'stands for' the n-adic
relation as a whole", since "stands for" is something that
I can assimilate as "denotes", "represents", or "signifies",
though, of course, when you go on to say "n-adic relation"
later on in this very same pharse, I no longer know with
any certainty whether you do indeed mean what I would mean
if I were to say "n-adic relation" or whether you mean instead
what I would mean if I said "n-adic relation instance" or just
plain "n-tuple".  In ordinary speech I would, of course, allow
for a certain amount of poetic license, but you know where that
will land us, booted clean out of this republic of disambiguity,
and in any case, even such as I see the need for being extremely
careful, here, at the very underpinnings of ontological security.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Take each each element in the relation occurance
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is what you call a "relation occurrence"
&gt; &gt; the same thing as a "relation instance",
&gt; &gt; that is, an n-tuple?  Or is it the x?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  The relation occurence is a tuple,
&gt;      an element is the thing in a place in a tuple.
&gt;      So &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;

Okay, I sometimes speak this way, too, when I am speaking loosely,
but that is not right at this moment, and so let me recommend the
usage of the term "component", which is a fair "stand-up-onym",
standardly understood on several continents and in not a few
widely practiced disciplines, instead of this "element", which,
as a keyword, will lead many astrayingly to think of that more
straighforwardly set-theoretic "elementhood" or "membership"
relation.

&gt; &gt; &gt; and create a relation between it and x.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay, I am guessing then that "relation occurrence" means "n-tuple".
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Yes.

So far, so good.

&gt; &gt; But then what do you mean by "each element in the relation occurrence"?
&gt; &gt; Do you mean "each component of the n-tuple"?
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  Sounds right -- see above.

Check, at least, until our licenses are revoked.

&gt; &gt; I am stuck at this point, and will need to wait for clarification.

To sum it up so far, let us see where we stand at present.

1.  We will need to be brutally clear, in future,
    as to when we are talking about n-tuples, and
    when we are talking about sets of n-tuples.

    For instance, a phrase like "relation as a whole",
    will, I'll bet, lead most folks who speak of such
    things to think of the "whole relation", which is
    broadly (extensionally) understood to be a set of
    tuples, or deeply (intensionally) comprehended as
    a property (intension) that all such tuples share.

2.  I am thoroughly mystified by your use of terms
    like "derivability", "replaces", &amp; "stands for"
    to describe the relation between x and a tuple,
    or else possibly between x and a set of tuples?

If you can clear up this little bit of underbrush,
I think that we may be poised to venture into the
interior.

Thanks In Prospect,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Use the role that the element plays
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the original relation to name
&gt; &gt; &gt; this binary relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Example:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary Book1)
&gt; &gt; &gt;      (and (gives x)
&gt; &gt; &gt;           (giver John)
&gt; &gt; &gt;           (receiver Mary)
&gt; &gt; &gt;           (given book1)
&gt; &gt; &gt;      )
&gt; &gt; &gt; )
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (probably flakey, but I hope intelligible.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
