Pat,
   Phooey!  (slightly more mature comments below):

&gt;&gt;Graham,
&gt;&gt;  I too am dismayed by the volume of discussion and the sense that 
&gt;&gt; although individual contributors have benefited from the discussion, and 
&gt;&gt; a rather small group is making progress on an ontology, that we're not 
&gt;&gt; working together and making collective progress on a standard.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should learn from this observation, rather than regretting it.

Just because we haven't yet found success is no reason to think it 
impossible.  What lesson would you have me learn, and how should that 
lesson follow from the SUO experience?

&gt;&gt;I believe that the solution is not improved document management or better 
&gt;&gt;tools but rather for folks to be specific and concrete in developing a 
&gt;&gt;formal document expressing their preferred version of an upper ontology.
&gt;
&gt;I think it is simply a reflection of a fact of life: people do not agree 
&gt;on ontological issues. They never have and they never will. Regretting 
&gt;this is like regretting that people speak different languages. My mum is 
&gt;sternly disapproving of the fact there there are people on the planet who 
&gt;don't naturally speak the Queen's English, an attitude that rather reminds 
&gt;me of yours towards the variety displayed on this very list.
&gt;
&gt;Don't you think that a better attitude to this fact might be to find a way 
&gt;to utilize it, rather than try to 'solve' the 'problem'?

Not at all.  People disagree when there is reason to do so, and find ways 
of agreeing when there is reason to do so.  In the KIF working group we 
have a compelling need to agree on a common language and semantics for the 
language.  We might each have our preferences, but we're willing to give up 
certain preferences here and there in order to reach consensus.

We don't all need to agree on every aspect of the SUO.  We merely need to 
have a product we can accept as a result of a lot of give and take.

&gt;&gt;  If you believe something specific is lacking in the Merged ontology 
&gt;&gt; that Ian has been working on, suggest a new axiom, or set of terms.
&gt;
&gt;Adam, speaking for myself, the major source of frustration is that people 
&gt;do not seem to read what one writes. Have you actually understood anything 
&gt;of what I wrote about what is wrong with the overall methodology of Niles' 
&gt;effort? It cannot be cured by adding more bits to it, any more than 
&gt;tossing a few more vegetables into a stew is going to turn it into a souffle.

I've read your comments and I simply don't agree with your 
criticisms.  Maybe I don't yet fully understand them.

&gt;&gt;If some folks would prefer EXIST or some other basis for the standard, 
&gt;&gt;then offer concrete extensions to it using the EBNF syntax defined for 
&gt;&gt;it.  Formalisms without explanation or discussion may make it difficult 
&gt;&gt;for some folks to communicate but discussion without formalisms will lead 
&gt;&gt;us simply to more talk.
&gt;&gt;  I would like to applaud those folks who have been very concrete (and 
&gt;&gt; forgive me for those who I have forgotten): Helena Sofia Pinto for 
&gt;&gt; contributing an ontology of units and measures, Nicola Guarino and his 
&gt;&gt; colleagues for their work on mereology, Pat Hayes for his detailed and 
&gt;&gt; specific help on temporal axioms, Chris Menzel, David Whitten and Robert 
&gt;&gt; Kent for their work on the "structural ontology". We should also thank 
&gt;&gt; John Sowa, Achille Varzi, Roberto Casati, James Allen, Barry Smith, 
&gt;&gt; Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig and all the unattributed contributors to 
&gt;&gt; the Ontolingua repository.
&gt;&gt;  If everyone on this list would create just some small ontology of even 
&gt;&gt; a dozen terms supported by axioms that has not yet been covered in the 
&gt;&gt; merged ontology, we could make tremendous progress.
&gt;
&gt;No, we would simply have a larger and even more confused stew. The 
&gt;axiomatizations would be incompatiable with each other and would be based 
&gt;on sharply different views of the world. Surely this is vividly clear from 
&gt;the postings on this list? Matthew West's axioms would talk of 4-d 
&gt;entities and be based on a solid physical nominalism; Lee Auspitz' axioms 
&gt;would assume a tensed ontology and would take human experiences as their 
&gt;basic framework. Others would write axioms which transliterate one of 
&gt;several different kinds of English grammatical theory. We even seem to 
&gt;disagree on what words like 'set' and 'class' mean.
&gt;
&gt;You have thanked me for my contribution on temporal axioms, but I wish you 
&gt;would not, since I regard the temporal axioms in Niles' document as a 
&gt;crock, and would refer that my name not be associated with them. There is 
&gt;no single generally useful axiomatization of time: that is why I wrote a 
&gt;temporal CATALOG, setting out the ALTERNATIVES and noting the ways they 
&gt;were INCOMPATIBLE with each other. I did that for a reason, not because I 
&gt;couldnt think of anything else.

We may disagree on English terms but I'm not clear on which axioms you 
disagree with.  In fact, although you've said often that you consider the 
current merged ontology "incoherent" or, as above, that there are sections 
that are "incompatible" with one another, I don't believe you've given a 
precise characterization of what you mean by those words.  Do you mean that 
the current ontology is logically inconsistent?  If so, let me issue a 
friendly challenge: show a proof using the axioms in the merged ontology 
which leads to a contradiction.  Let me issue an even stronger challenge 
since if there are in fact any contradictions I suspect we can fix them: 
show two proofs leading to contractions for which any fixes would generate 
more contradictions.

&gt;&gt;This could also include domain-specific ontologies as the exercise of 
&gt;&gt;linking such ontologies to the merged ontology will elucidate the general 
&gt;&gt;areas that need to be developed.
&gt;&gt;  How about a practical semiotics of books, recordings and documents;
&gt;
&gt;Would it take a book to be a semiotic text with a physical encoding, or a 
&gt;physical object (a continuant or a 4-d lifetime?) to which contentful 
&gt;relations can be applied, or a kind of 'sum' of a physical entity plus a 
&gt;nonphysical 'text', or a collection (what kind of collection?) of surfaces 
&gt;bearing information-encoding marks, or...? (Please don't say 'all of 
&gt;these') Some people think of books as things with a history, like old 
&gt;furniture.

These are exactly the sort of questions the author of an ontology of 
semiotics should ask, and answer.  That they have not been answered in this 
discussion group should not suggest that they can't be answered 
satisfactorily.  Since you've asked, let me attempt an answer.  I'll call 
on Ian to correct any erroneous connections that I may make with the merged 
ontology (given below as a term with an initial capital).

A book is a physical object with a lifetime - subclass of VariableObject
A book is related to the "conceptual work" which is the information content 
of the text in the book.
A conceptual work is a ContentBearingObject (it may more specifically be a 
Sign).
A conceptual work has temporal extent, at least one author, and no physical 
extent.
A particular coding of the conceptual work is also a Sign.
A book contains a particular coding of the conceptual work.


&gt;&gt;how about some basic graph theory with application to roads or computer 
&gt;&gt;networks; how about an ontology of human obligations;  an ontology of 
&gt;&gt;speech acts;  an ontology of textures and coverings;  an ontology of 
&gt;&gt;materials;  an ontology transfers of possession.  The number and richness 
&gt;&gt;of available areas is astonishing.
&gt;
&gt;"All human life is there", I think is the quote you want.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;For academics and industrial researchers there are a wealth of possible 
&gt;&gt;papers to write on these topics.
&gt;
&gt;This raises an interesting question, in fact: where CAN one publish papers 
&gt;on ontological content?

The IJCAI SUO workshop naturally :-).  Also FOIS-2001, and KR-2002.  The 
Banff KA conference and AAAI would be possible although not every good 
ontology paper would get accepted in those forums I suspect.  Casati and 
Varzi's "Holes" book is published my MIT press so they're certainly open to 
publishing books on ontologies.
