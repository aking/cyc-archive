Back to the grinstone, as I try to work my way through
the filings that are piling up in JD's file of comments.
With my gnosis to the cossis this way, I still cannot see
the Big Picture yet, and so I will just have to continue to
continue in a opportunistically piece-meal incermental style.

The chief obstruction that I espy at present to our digging what
Peirce laid down at this site is this matter of whether we have
gotten clear yet about the rules of the &quot;natural kinds game&quot;.

So return with me now to this exchange:

JD: So now, we are ready to restate and comment some
    Peirce excerpts you mentioned in your mails:

| The first of these terms has no comprehension which is
| adequate to the limitation of the extension.  In fact,
| men, horses, kangaroos, and whales have no attributes
| in common which are not possessed by the entire class
| of mammals.  For this reason, this disjunctive term,
| 'man and horse and kangaroo and whale', is of no use
| whatever.  For suppose it is the subject of a sentence;
| suppose we know that men and horses and kangaroos and
| whales have some common character.  Since they have no
| common character which does not belong to the whole class
| of mammals, it is plain that 'mammals' may be substituted
| for this term.  Suppose it is the predicate of a sentence,
| and that we know that something is either a man or a horse
| or a kangaroo or a whale;  then, the person who has found
| out this, knows more about this thing than that it is a
| mammal;  he therefore knows which of these four it is for
| these four have nothing in common except what belongs to
| all other mammals.  Hence in this case the particular
| one may be substituted for the disjunctive term.
| A disjunctive term, then, -- one which aggregates
| the extension of several symbols, -- may always be
| replaced by a simple term.  (CSP, CE 1, 468).

JD: This is only true if the &quot;common character&quot; which has
    been spotted is in fact common to all mammals and not a
    newly discovered characteristic shared only by men, horses,
    kangaroos, and whales among mammals!  In this case there *is*
    in fact a possible new &quot;comprehension which is adequate to the
    limitation of the extension&quot;, just add this new 'attribute' to
    the 'Content' mammals and give a name to this new 'Content',
    say &quot;weirdo-mammals&quot;, if you don't do that you don't have a
    name to use to replace &quot;men, horses, kangaroos, and whales&quot;
    because you would abusively make statements about mammals
    which should apply only to &quot;weirdo-mammals&quot;.

JA: It is necessary to understand the rules of the natural kinds game.
    Assume that X is the universe of discourse.  everybody knows what
    It would be like to work within the power set of X, the lattice
    Set(X) = (Pow(X), =&gt;).  but the natural kinds lattice Nat(X)
    that we are given to work with is more restricted than this.
    Today we would talk of &quot;accessible predicates&quot; and such.
    Yes, it sounds silly to speak of accessible predicates
    in a finite universe, but it is merely an exposition,
    not a competition.  Or maybe it is.  Try to imagine
    that you are on a TV game show where there's a lot
    of money riding on it if you can just manage to
    simulate the thinking of an &quot;ordinary thinker&quot;
    and not that of a nit-picking wiseacre.  Yes,
    it's easier said than done, but we must try.

On further reflection, it may be better to
say &quot;admissible predicates&quot; here, but the
underlying point remains exactly the same.

If the game-show host says &quot;men, horses, kangaroos, whales&quot;,
then without hardly thinking -- they don't have to think --
the ordinary thinker is already punching the buzzer and
screaming &quot;mammals!&quot;

And what is our weiﬂenheimer logic nerd thinking?  Voila! --

<A  HREF="http://math.gc.cuny.edu/Logic/MAMLS/">http://math.gc.cuny.edu/Logic/MAMLS/</A>

Now, I ask you, do &quot;weirdo-mammals&quot; sound like the sort of
critters that would be found in the &quot;great chain of being&quot;,
if the great chain of being is bound to natural creation?

I think that we cannot go much further without a measure
of understanding about the nature of this natural quarry.

Jon Awbrey
