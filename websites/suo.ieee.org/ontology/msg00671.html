Dear Matthew,  you are too kind in your grading!

Let me once again try to capture your POV as briefly as possible.

1. A spatio-temporal object (alias a spatio-temporal extent) is something
in the real world, and can be represented at as a whole by a constant.

2. An activity is something in the real world.  An activity is involved in
actual relationships but they are not the activity.

3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent (you believe that this follows
from 1 &amp; 2, but see below).

4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the real world, but
if you are qualified to study advanced topics you may wish to consider
representations of relations in the real world)

5. From 1 and 3 it follows that an Activity can be modelled as a whole by a
constant. The relationships of an activity can be modeled by relations
containing that constant.  The example is modelled using multiple dyadic
and triadic relations.

6. Attempting to model activities as a single n-adic relation may be
adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
between systems, and by implication for the SUO.

Whether 3 follows from 1 &amp; 2 depends on whether or not anything other than
spatio-temporal extents can be in the real world.  Elsewhere you said
"Actual relationships exist in the same way that actual classes do. They
are abstract objects that are out there that we can take an interest in and
use to organise and think about the world.".  This suggests you do
recognize things other than spatio-temporal extents in the real world.  It
follows there needs to be some justification why an activity is a
spatio-temporal extent and not anything else.

Please can you specify what other things you do recognize in the real world
at the same sort of meta-level as spatio-temporal extents, idealy with a
specific example (like Activity) of each.

My only other comment at this stage is that, while I am happy to see a
constant in some sense as a surrogate for something as a whole, I see no
way of thinking or talking about e.g. an activity as meaningful, without
seeing the actual relationships as part of it.  I see this as a matter of
interpretation and not an inconsistency.

I hope you will agree with me that the answer to the original question "Is
an activity a relation?" is, in this context, an emphatic no, because the
activity is in the real world and the relation is a representation.  The
six points above are an answer to what might have been the real question
"Can an activity be represented by a relation?".

I have trimmed some of the tail of this exchange.

Yours, Martin

Dear Martin,

Alpha-plus easily. See below for minor tidy-ups.

&gt;
&gt; Matthew, thanks for this. Trying to capture your POV again:
&gt;
&gt; 1. A spatio-temporal object (alias a spatio-temporal extent)
&gt; is something
&gt; in the real world, and can be represented at least in part by
&gt; a constant.

MW: I would say it represents the whole of the activity, i.e. it is a
surrogate for it. The constant does not represent the relationships the
activity has, but then the relationships the activity has are not the
activity in the real world either.
&gt;
&gt; 2. An activity is something in the real world.

MW: Therefore.
&gt;
&gt; 3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent
&gt;
&gt; 4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the
&gt; real world, but
&gt; if you are qualified to study advanced topics you may wish to consider
&gt; representations of relations in the real world)
&gt;
&gt; 5. From 1 and 3 it follows that an Activity can be modelled
&gt; in part by a

MW: in whole rather than in part.

&gt; constant. An activity can be modeled more fully by the union
&gt; of a constant
&gt; and relations containing that constant.  The example is modelled using
&gt; multiple dyadic and triadic relations.

MW: The relations represent the actual relationships of the activity, not
the activity (see above). It is worth noting that in KIF constants are
declared implicity, not explcity, so you do not come across a constant
until
you want to say something about it.
&gt;
&gt; 6. Attempting to model a activities as a single n-adic relation may be
&gt; adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
&gt; between systems, and by implication for the SUO.

MW: Correct.
&gt;
&gt; Note that I have followed my principle of trying to use the
&gt; singular case
&gt; (e.g. Activity rather than Activities).  I find this is a
&gt; very powerful aid
&gt; to achieving precision.

MW: My preference too. some times I am sloppy.
&gt;
&gt; Can I ever hope for alpha-plus?  Yours, Martin

MW: We are well into alpha-plus territory here.
&gt;
============================================
Dear Martin,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actual relationships exist in the same way that actual
&gt; &gt; classes do. They are
&gt; &gt; abstract objects that are out there that we can take an
&gt; &gt; interest in and use
&gt; &gt; to organise and think about the world. Actual relationships
&gt; &gt; are what one
&gt; &gt; thing has to do with another. I note that a relation like:
&gt; &gt; &lt;purchase, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;
&gt; &gt; does not represent a relationship, but actually a number of
&gt; &gt; relationships
&gt; &gt; that each element of this construct has to an object that is
&gt; &gt; not part of,
&gt; &gt; but may be inferred from this construct.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So in analysis I look for recognition of this. I would
&gt; &gt; analyse the above
&gt; &gt; into:
&gt; &gt; &lt;Purchase a&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;Purchaseof a b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;Datetimeof a 12:15-12th-August-1999&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;lawnmower b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;HondaCB250 b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;hasprice HondaCB250 c&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;GBPvaluemap c 500&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Or something similar. So I have extracted and represented the actual
&gt; &gt; relationships.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not that there is anything wrong with the original data
&gt; structure in a
&gt; &gt; purchasing system, but you do have to extract what it means
&gt; &gt; if you are to
&gt; &gt; make that available without everyone having to learn the
&gt; &gt; language of every
&gt; &gt; other system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does this provide an answer?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt;       Matthew
&gt; &gt; ============================================
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear John,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This doesn't help us much. In particular it doesn;t answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question we
&gt; &gt; &gt; started with, which is "Is an activity a relation?" where at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least Pat,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chris P and I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; would feel uncompfortable that a relation was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent. On
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hand many others note that activities are frequently
&gt; modelled as
&gt; &gt; &gt; relations. Perhaps it is OK to do both, in which case is this
&gt; &gt; &gt; inconsistent?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or does it just not matter?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt; &gt;       Matthew
