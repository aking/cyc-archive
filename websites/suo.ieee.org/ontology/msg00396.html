John,

	Here is some information about points relating to the "trouble
spots".

&gt; WG
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that the work you have done is a useful beginning.
&gt; In fact, it might be a very good way to focus our attention
&gt; on something concrete, instead of the aimless commentary
&gt; that we have been engaged in for the past several months.
&gt; 
&gt; Request:  In order to help us address the "trouble spots"
&gt; that require further work, could you please send us some
&gt; information about the following points:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. What additions have you made (other than translations
&gt;     to KIF) beyond the original source files you started with?

OK, here's a list of the main links I added to the ontology to incorporate
merging.  I'll follow up this email with another, if I find important, added
links that aren't addressed here.

;; Taxonomy of roles/predicates/functions

(subclass-of Predicate Role)
(subclass-of Function Role)
(subclass-of UnaryFunction Function)
(subclass-of BinaryFunction Function)
(subclass-of TernaryFunction Function)
(subclass-of VariableArityFunction Function)
(subclass-of BinaryRelation Predicate)
(subclass-of TernaryRelation Predicate)
(subclass-of VariableArityRelation Predicate)
(subclass-of CaseRole BinaryRelation)

;; Locating the concepts of 'Number' and 'Set' in your upper-level ontology.
I know you describe a 
;; a different way of doing this in your book, but I wanted something that
was less philosophical.

(subclass-of Number Arrangement)
(subclass-of Set Arrangement)

;; Locating the concept of 'Organism' in the ontology

(subclass-of Organism Organic)

;; Constants needed for framing the temporal axioms

   (nth-domain exists-at 1 Actuality)
   (nth-domain exists-at 2 TimePoint)
   (documentation exists-at "Means that the Process/Object exists at the
given point in time")

  (subclass-of TimeInterval TemporalEntity)
  (documentation TimeInterval "An interval of time.")

  (subclass-of TimePoint TemporalEntity)
  (documentation TimePoint "A TimePoint is not a measurement of time, nor is
it a specification of time.  It is the point in time. The TimePoints at
which events occur can be known with various degrees of precision and
approximation, but conceptually TimePoints are point-like and not
interval-like.  That is, it doesn't make sense to talk about what happens
during a TimePoint, or how long the TimePoint lasts.")

  (subclass-of TimeMeasure TemporalEntity)
  (subclass-of TimeMeasure-Duration TimeMeasure)
  (subclass-of TimeMeasure-Position TimeMeasure)

;; Locating 'hole-in' and 'Hole' in the taxonomy 

(instance-of hole-in BinaryRelation)
(nth-domain hole-in 1 Object)
(nth-domain hole-in 2 Hole)

(subclass-of Hole Property)

&gt; 
&gt;  2. What assumptions did you find it necessary to make in
&gt;     order to fill in the gaps between the various sources?

The assumptions that I made in constructing the merged ontology are
contained in the extra subsumption links addressed above. 

&gt; 
&gt;  3. Which areas seemed to raise the largest number of questions?
&gt;     And where did you need to make modifications in order to
&gt;     make the source ontologies fit together?

The parts of the merged ontology that I'm least comfortable with are the
sections entitled "Mereotopological Definitions/Axioms", "Theory of Holes",
and "Temporal Definitions/Axioms".  I think a more substantive alignment of
the first two sections should be possible.  In particular, it would be
optimal if the theory of holes could be derived from the basic
mereotopology.  I'm not sure about how to do this, so the more substantive
alignment has not been attempted yet.  Again, I welcome any comments about
how to do this.  As for "Temporal Definitions/Axioms", I overhauled the
formulation of many of the axioms in this section on the basis of Pat Hayes'
suggestions, and I think there's probably still room for improvement here.  

&gt; 
&gt; I still agree with Pat that the current version of the merged
&gt; ontology is not yet suitable as a "base document".  But perhaps
&gt; we might come closer to something concrete if we jointly
&gt; addressed the "trouble spots" that you have uncovered in your
&gt; work.  It might help us to make some progress toward a truly
&gt; collaborative ontology effort.
&gt;
