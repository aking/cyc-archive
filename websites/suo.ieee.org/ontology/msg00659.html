Dear Fred,

I agree with all the showstoppers you mentioned.

&gt; Subject: SUO: Explanation-XMP,NTH,4D,TIM,ACR,INV,DOI,CHG (et. al?)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I stumbled into these postings backwards:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) In responding to Jim's query about my "NO" vote 
&gt;    I sent him a little list of potential
&gt;    "show stoppers" I'd been accumulating.
&gt;    I had a long list (circa 10 items) because 
&gt;    I prefer to decouple these concerns 
&gt;    as much as possible.
&gt;   
&gt; 2) Jim suggested that I post my list.
&gt;    Instead I tried to "vet" each assertion of a
&gt;    "show stopper" by contacting someone I thought 
&gt;    could help me make the assertion clear, and who
&gt;    thought that there's really a fundamental flaw. 
&gt;    Regrettably, I didn't copy Jim.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Jim forwarded the unvetted version of the list to Ian.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Folks I'd contacted began not only reporting to me
&gt;    whether the assertion was well-stated but also their
&gt;    commentary on the assertion.  
&gt;    In particular, Ian responded extensively, to Jim and me.
&gt;    
&gt; 4) I found myself faced with a rapidly-closing window
&gt;    of opportunity and a problem.  
&gt;    I chose to post, in a standard format,
&gt;    all the supposed fundamental flaws for which I had received 
&gt;     - an affirmation that the assertion is 
&gt;          meaningful and has an advocate or
&gt;     - commentary to me that I felt should be "on the record".
&gt;    
&gt; 
&gt; The hope and intent is 
&gt;   --to put stuff I was sitting on, onto the record (quickly)
&gt;   --to provide a vehicle whereby these issues can be driven 
&gt; to closure.
&gt; 
&gt; Closure would be achieved if people
&gt; simply respond with an "AGREE"/"YES" or a "DISAGREE"/"NO".
&gt; 
&gt; If these assertions are *all* rejected ("DISAGREE"/"NO"), 
&gt; then that universal rejection would tend to constitute a 
&gt; "green light" for the Merged Ontology as a suitable 
&gt; origin/basis of the IEEE SUO.

&gt; WG
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; I certainly see a lot of good coming out of work on Ian's 
&gt; Merged Ontology
&gt; and 
&gt; work on it is currently our most effective vector for progress.
&gt; 
&gt; But there have been on the order of ten difficulties with the Merged
&gt; Ontology asserted to be "show-stoppers".
&gt; By show-stopper, I mean a fundamental flaw requiring that the entire
&gt; approach be pretty much set aside as unusable.
&gt; 
&gt; Following are my current notes on potential show-stoppers.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO be able to 
&gt; represent time
&gt; and change (Pat Hayes)
&gt; 
&gt; 2) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO be able to represent
&gt; alternative courses of reality (Pat Hayes)
&gt; 
&gt; 3) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have no 
&gt; incommensurate views
&gt; on basic ontological issues (Pat Hayes)
&gt; 
&gt; 4) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have no 
&gt; unrelated views on
&gt; basic ontological issues (Pat Hayes)
&gt; 
&gt; 5) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have a 4D 
&gt; orientation rather
&gt; than a 3D foundation  (Matthew West)
&gt; 
&gt; 6) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have no n-th Domain
&gt; (Matthew West)
&gt; 
&gt; 7) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO include a means for
&gt; articulation of domains of interest for subtending ontologies
&gt; 
&gt; 8) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO be an 
&gt; *example* of an upper
&gt; level which can be adapted, extended, or partly disabled  
&gt; (Josiah Auspitz)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My  "no" was  procedural:  
&gt; Because of the extent of the potential show-stopper list it 
&gt; seemed safer to
&gt; 1) work hard to develop and improve the Merged Ontology but
&gt; 2) not expose ourselves to the embarassment of having an 
&gt; evolving standard
&gt; which later is shown
&gt;    to be fundamentally flawed (thus the preference to call it 
&gt; a WP, not a
&gt; draft standard)
&gt; 3) have a proponent of each alleged show-stopper 
&gt;      i) sharpen the relevant statement above 
&gt;      ii) lead or at least be active in a discussion of the issue
&gt;      iii) abide by a vote on the issue
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to obstruct progress
&gt; and so if, after cogitating a bit on the above, you'd still 
&gt; recommend a YES,
&gt; I'm content to vote that way.
&gt; 
&gt;     Regards,
&gt;      -Fred

&gt; &gt; as suggestions for improvements, which we will be resolved

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; SUO,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I vote NO (re establishing Ian Niles' Merged Ontology as a 
&gt; base document),
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; reasoning as follows.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The group is in a productive challenge-response mode.
&gt; &gt; The Merged Ontology should be a working paper.
&gt; &gt; Formal votes should be taken, after discussion, on each
&gt; &gt; of the several ways it is claimed to be fundamentally flawed:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) Requirement for a representation of time and change,
&gt; &gt; 2) Requirement for a representation of  alternative courses 
&gt; of reality,
&gt; &gt; 3) Disallowance of incommensurate views unrelated to one another,
&gt; &gt; 4) .....
