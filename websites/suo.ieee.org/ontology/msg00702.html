John, 
	.	Thanks for an informative elaboration of your position. Well
said! 

	.	In part, this helps my appreciation of the breadth of the
tensions over relations &amp; relationships. I particularly appreciated your
point about actions &amp; nouns (including the corollaries of actions and
symbols, and of concepts and nouns). 

	.	I agree with your approach to 3-D &amp; 4-D issues. The strict
4-D for almost everything makes many matters just too cumbersome.

Subject:	SUO: RE: More KIF-ified Ontology Content


Graham, Matthew, Chris P., Lee, et al.,

My suggestion of "naive realism" and emphasis on what can be expressed in
KIF was not intended to disparage or eliminate philosophy, metaphysics, or
metalanguage about how language relates to the world.

My primary intention was to draw a sharp distinction between the definitions
and axioms that are expressed in KIF and the metalevel talk about them.
When we get down to what is expressed in KIF (or any similar language, such
as predicate calculus, conceptual graphs, and many other formalisms), most,
if not all, of the metalevel discussions become irrelevant -- i.e., they
don't make any difference in how KIF is used to define and apply the
ontology.

Example of a typical question:  "Is an activity a relation?" The answer to
that question is no, because a relation is a term that is used to describe
KIF, and an activity is something to be described by the ontology.
Different topics - different languages -- different terms.

But if you use KIF to make statements about activities, then you will have
to use relations to represent activities and whatever you want to say about
them.  In English, you can use a noun to talk about an activity, but that
does not make an activity a noun.  Similarly, you don't make an activity a
relation by using a relation in KIF to say something about it.

Another question that keeps coming up is whether we should use a
4-dimensional representation or a 3-D + time representation. My answer is
simple:  both.  For some purposes, a 4D rep is better; for others, it is
better to use 3D + time.  There is no contradiction between them because you
can express both systems in KIF, and you can write KIF expressions to
convert one into the other.  There are some statements in one that do not
have a simple, direct conversion; so those you don't convert.

The difference is very much like the distinction in fluid mechanics between
Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinate systems. In one, you look at a little bit
of fluid, and follow its motion around the system.  In the other, you look
at a single point and watch the fluid that flows past.  Some problems are
easier to express in one system than in the other, but there are ways to
convert from one to the other.  And both of them can be expressed in KIF, or
CGs, or English, or whatever.

If we focus on what is expressed in KIF, many of the long-winded arguments
become moot because they don't make a difference to what is finally written
down in axioms and definitions.  That doesn't mean that those arguments
might not be useful for motivation, intuition, insight into what is going
on, or some sort of methodology for ontology design and development.

Bottom line:  Before getting lost in heated arguments, look at what
difference that discussion will make in the final result. 
No difference -- no problem.

John Sowa
