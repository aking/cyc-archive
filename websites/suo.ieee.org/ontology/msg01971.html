Dear Colleagues,

I have put various bits of where I currently stand in various 
threads over the last year. I have found on a number of 
occasions that this position has been misunderstood by at 
least some. So I thought I would try to set down some of these 
matters in one place, so that you can disagree with what I 
really think, rather than what you imagine I think.

MOTIVATION

In the end, any view of the world is just that, a view of the
world. Some may be more accurate, or more useful for some 
purpose. But then you had better understand the purpose you
have in mind.

For more than 10 years I have been looking at how you can 
create a model that can integrate other models of differing
viewpoints and purposes. This is slightly different from
incorporating different view points in an encyclopaedic sense,
it means more being able to map any other view point into or
out of the integrating view point you are developing. 

OK so that may be asking a lot, but one of the things I have
learnt is that the easiest way not to achieve something is to be
limited by your ambition, so failure against that ambition by
some margin would still be pretty good.

Of course implicit in this is that I am quite happy that there
are other viewpoints, each of which may be more or less useful
for particular purposes. I am interested in understanding 
these so that I can check whether the viewpoint I am trying to
develop can support a round trip mapping to and from that 
viewpoint. 

You can of course incorporate all the viewpoints and the 
mappings into an encyclopaedic ontology. Whether you choose to 
do this is a structuring rather than conceptual issue.

What follows is an overview of key elements of that viewpoint
(for which I claim no originality) and some issues of how that
can be represented within the KIF language.

EXTENSIONALIST

If you want to put a label on me, then I think extensionalist
is probably your best bet. What I mean by this is taking as an
identity criteria for things, that any two things with the same 
extension are the same thing. (It might be more proper to say
that there are not two (or more) things with the same 
extension).

The world then divides neatly into two basic sorts, sets 
(including relations) and individuals (or particulars if you
prefer) where individuals are things that have an extension
in space time, and sets are things that have members. 

One thing to note about this position is that any piece of
space time is an individual, just as any collection of things
is a set. That is different again from having to be interested
in all of them.

The extension of individuals being in space time give rise 
to the 4D label.

It follows that some important ways in which things stand to
one another are set membership and whole part.

A key thing to note is that this extensional approach 
automatically takes care of change over time, using states as
the backbone of how this is managed. Competent and 
comprehensive accounting for change is a critical component of
any ontology that is going to cope with a changing world.

POSSIBLE WORLDS

One of the key challenges for any viewpoint is how to model
what could be (past present and future), as well as what 
is/has been. This is done using a "possible worlds" approach,
or more properly possible universes, in which spatio-temporal
parts can be shared between different possible universes. So
my life up to today can be part of any possible future I might
have.

A consequence of this (I believe) is that modal logic is not 
required.

REPRESENTATION

KIF is a language, so is EXPRESS. Languages inevitably have
capabilities and limitations. A viewpoint can be mapped onto
the constructs of a language, in more than one way. It then 
becomes important to consider how you intend to undertake the 
mapping. There are advantages in doing so in a consistent 
manner, and in being aware of what it is you are doing.

So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction if I
am not) the key constructs in KIF are:
 - constants
 - variables (and more generally lambda calculus)
 - predication
 - relation
 - some basic elements of logic

The question is how do you choose to use these. The only thing
that is certain is that if you are not consistent you will 
store up trouble for yourself.

The choices I make are:

 - classes and individuals map to constants
   note: remember that activities like giving are individuals
 - predication is used for set membership.
   note: in an extensional world you do not need non-
   extensional classes
 - how one individual stands to another is modelled by relation 
   instances
   note: only binary relations are used. This is principally
   to minimise structural constraints where all places in a 
   relation must be filled, when some are not known.
   note: see below for relations between classes.
 - lambda calculus is used for defining constraints. In general 
   these indicate how a member of one class must stand in 
   respect to a member of another class.
   note: relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are only
   allowed when the nature of the constraint they define is
   defined by a lambda expression.

Of course I do not claim other choices for other reasons could
not be made.

Actually, everything else flows from these relatively simple
start points and rationale.

Regards  
      Matthew
