Jon, when there is a triplet there are three pairs. Having a genuine triad
does not prevent the fact that O determines S, S determines I, and O determines
I through S.

<blockquote>35 - v, 1906 - C.P. 5-473 - Pragmatism .
<br>[...] <b>That thing which causes a sign as such is called the object</b>
(according to the usage of speech, the "real", but more accurately, the
existent object) represented by the sign : the sign is determined to some
species of correspondence with that object.[...]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>40 - v.1907 - MS 318, Pragmatism.
<br>[...] Now any sign, of whatsoever kind, professes to mediate between
<b>an object</b>, on the one hand, that to which it applies, and<b> which
is thus in a sense the cause of the sign,</b> and, on the other hand, a
Meaning, or to use a referable technical term, an Interpretant, that which
the sign expresses, the result which it produces in its capacity as sign.
[...]
<p>c - [...] Now the essential nature of a sign is that it mediates between
its object which is supposed to determine it and to be, in some sense,<b>
the cause of it,</b> and its meaning, or, as I prefer to say, in order
to avoid certains ambiguities, its Interpretant which is determined by
the sign, and is, in a sense, the effect of it; and which the sign represents
to flow as an influences, from the object. [...]
<p>f - I am now prepared to risk an attempt at defining a sign, -since
in scientific inquiry, as in other enterprises, the maxim holds : nothing
hazard, nothing gain. I will say that a sign is anything, of whatsoever
mode of being, which mediates between an object and an interpretant; since
it is both determined by the object relatively to the interpretant, and
determining the interpretant in reference to the object, in such wise <b>as
to cause the interpretant to be determined by the object </b>through the
mediation of this "sign".
<p>52 - v. 1909 - C.P. 6-347 -Some Amazing Mazes, Fourth Curiosity.
<br>[...] Suffice it to say that a sign endeavours to represent, in part
at least, an Object, which is therefore in a sense the cause, or determinant,
of the sign even if the sign represents its object falsely. But to say
that it represents its object implies that it affects a mind, and so affects
it as, in some respect, to determine in that mind something that is mediately
due to the Object.

of which <b>the immediate cause</b>, or determinant, is the sign, and of
<b>which the mediate cause</b> is the Object may be termed the Interpretant
[...]
<p>59 - 1911 - MS 854 - Notes on logical critique of the essential Articles
of religious Faith (20.11.1911)
<br>The "Object" dog <b>causes us</b> to think of is such a dog as the
person addressed has any notion of. But the real Object includes alternatively
other dogs which are not known to the party addressed as yet but which
he may come to know.
<p>The sign may appeal to the Interpreter himself to assert that the Matter
of Fact denoted does call for the....of certain character... or the <b>Sign
may exert a Force to cause</b> the Interpreter to attach some Idea to the
Object of the Sign.

<br>But an issue like that can only be decided by returning to the source,
<br>and comparing what the source says with what we can discover to make
<br>sense in objective practice, and not being too selective in the
<br>emphasis of our reading and the boldness of our citing.
<p>> In the case of the sign, object, and interpretant, you have
<br>> to consider their respective forms.&nbsp; Choose the form of O
<br>> and it will cause the form of S to not be what it could have
<br>> been, had O not been what you chose it to be;&nbsp; idem with I.
<br>> For instance a priman in O can only determine a priman in S;
<br>> a secundan in O can only determine a secundan or 2 primans
<br>> in S, etc.
<p>Again you interject the word "cause", which worries me.</blockquote>
