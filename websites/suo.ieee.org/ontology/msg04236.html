| Where number is irrelevant, regimented mathematical technique
| has hitherto tended to be lacking.  Thus it is that the progress
| of natural science has depended so largely upon the discernment of
| measurable quantity of one sort or another.  Measurement consists
| in correlating our subject matter with the series of real numbers;
| and such correlations are desirable because, once they are set up,
| all the well-worked theory of numerical mathematics lies ready at
| hand as a tool for our further reasoning.  But no science can rest
| entirely on measurement, and many scientific investigations are
| quite out of reach of that device.  To the scientist longing for
| non-quantitative techniques, then, mathematical logic brings hope.
| It provides explicit techniques for manipulating the most basic
| ingredients of discourse.  Its yield for science may be expected to
| consist also in a contribution of rigor and clarity -- a sharpening of
| the concepts of science.  Such sharpening of concepts should serve both
| to disclose hitherto hidden consequences of given scientific hypotheses,
| and to obviate subtle errors which may stand in the way of scientific
| progress.

This is one of my favorite epigraphs.  It proclaims a vision
of applied mathematical logic that has everything to do with
why I first got excited about its possibilities in the first
place, and why I still bother to pursue the dream of Leibniz
after all these many years.  But it more and more reads like
an epitaph lately, marking the grave of all my fondest hopes.
Fifty years later, unless you count the boolean computations
and the &quot;programmable logic arrays&quot; (PLA's) that grind on in
the unconscious minds of our machines today, all unwitted by
most of us, there is nothing like the brand of applied logic
that Quine envisioned, with the power to address significant
questions in the sciences and the humanities, able to assist
in clarifying our fundamental concepts, or routinely serving
to generate plausible answers to any such orders of problems.

&quot;Why is that?&quot; I wonder.

The distance between different perspectives on the
usefulness of logic in science is much vaster than
I ever would have imagined just a short while ago.

In one place I find myself constantly defending the potential utility
of formalized logic, indeed, of logic itself, in scientific inquiry.
In another place I find myself cast as the unwelcome critic of what
is without hint of embarrassment or irony quite literally described
as &quot;God's Own Logic&quot; (GOL), all because I cast a critical eye on the
secular implementations and the human institutions of the eternal ideal.

I am devoting this line of thought to thinking about that.

I now begin what I anticipate will be the most likely thankless task
of trying to cast one or two critical reflections on the way that we
are currently going about trying to apply logical calculi of various
orders, but mostly the first, to the problems of ontology.  I tackle
this task as a person who has always turned to FOL first whenever it
came time to try and formulate some problem of interest to myself in
a computably logical fashion, whether the problem was in mathematics
or in psychology, so I feel that it is fair to say that my criticism
is the critique of a hopeful believer not of the initially faithless.

Still ...

It is pointless to aim at an ideal entity like FOL as the target
of too much critical focus.  As the abstract ghost of a departed
ideal, it always manages to transport itself to another location,
far and away from any site or simple locution that one elects to
be firing one's critical phaser through.  But its total immunity
from prosecution makes it just as shortsighted in execution, for
specifying concrete implementations of logically useful systems.

I wish it had not taken me so long to figure that out ...

My next idea was that maybe I should try to get a bead on
the &quot;families of notations and implementations&quot; (FONAI's)
that we find ourselves using at a given moment in time,
and there is still a lot of progress that can be made
by doing just that.

Still ...

I am just starting to realize that far subtler factors are at work here.
It is not so much the FONAI's themselves as the ways that they are used
at a given moment in the intellectual history and the subcultural phase
of development of a particular &quot;institution of notation&quot; (ION), say, by
a particular school of thought.  The working attitude of that school of
thought was already embodied in community norms and customary practices
long before any of its members picked up a particular FONAI that looked
of utility in serving the group aims.  So it is these ION's that I must
try to capture and aim to weigh here.

From what I have seen so far, in following the charge that we find embodied
in the visions of ..., Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz, Boole, Peirce, Quine, ...
I think it is fair to say that the ION's we currently have are insufficient
to carry it.

To be continued ...

Jon Awbrey
