Inquiry, Formality, Semiosis SIG's --

While looking into my dissertation for concrete illustrations of sign relations,
I found to my amazement that the set-up for the &quot;Story of A and B&quot; contains not
a few reflections that may throw a different light on our recent animadversions
over the topic of formalization.  So here 'tis ...

1.3.4  Discussion of Formalization:  Concrete Examples

The previous section outlined a variety of general issues
surrounding the concept of formalization.  The following
section will plot the specific objectives of this project
in constructing formal models of intellectual processes.
In this section I wish to take a breather between these
abstract discussions in order to give their main ideas
a few points of contact with terra firma.  To do this,
I examine a selection of concrete examples, artificially
constructed to approach the minimum levels of non-trivial
complexity, that are intended to illustrate the kinds of
mathematical objects I have in mind using as formal models.

1.3.4.1  Formal Models:  A Sketch

To sketch the features of the modeling activity that are
relevant to the immediate purpose:  The modeler begins with
a &quot;phenomenon of interest&quot; or a &quot;process of interest&quot; (POI) and
relates it to a formal &quot;model of interest&quot; (MOI), the whole while
working within a particular &quot;interpretive framework&quot; (IF) and relating
the results from one &quot;system of interpretation&quot; (SOI) to another, or to
a subsequent development of the same SOI.

The POI's that define the intents and the purposes of this project
are the closely related processes of inquiry and interpretation,
so the MOI's that must be formulated are models of inquiry and
interpretation, species of formal systems that are even more
intimately bound up than usual with the IF's employed and
the SOI's deployed in their ongoing development as models.

Since all of the interpretive systems and all of the process models
that are being mentioned here come from the same broad family of
mathematical objects, the different roles that they play in this
investigation are mainly distinguished by variations in their
manner and degree of formalization:

1.  The typical POI comes from natural sources and casual conduct.
    It is not formalized in itself but only in the form of its
    image or model, and just to the extent that aspects of its
    structure and function are captured by a formal MOI.  But
    the richness of any natural phenomenon or realistic process
    seldom falls within the metes and bounds of any final or
    finite formula.

2.  Beyond the initial stages of investigation, the MOI is postulated as a
    completely formalized object, or is quickly on its way to becoming one.
    As such, it serves as a pivotal fulcrum and a point of application poised
    between the undefined reaches of &quot;phenomena&quot; and &quot;noumena&quot;, respectively,
    terms that serve more as directions of pointing than as denotations of
    entities.  What enables the MOI to grasp these directions is the quite
    felicitous mathematical circumstance that there can be well-defined and
    finite relations between entities that are infinite and even indefinite
    in themselves.  Indeed, exploiting this handle on infinity is the main
    trick of all computational models and effective procedures.  It is how a
    &quot;finitely informed creature&quot; (FIC) can &quot;make infinite use of finite means&quot;.
    Thus, my reason for calling the MOI pivotal or cardinal is that it forms
    a model in two senses, loosely analogical and more strictly logical,
    integrating twin roles of the model concept in a single focus.

3.  Finally, the IF's and the SOI's always remain partly out of sight,
    caught up in various stages of explicit notice between casual
    informality and partial formalization, with no guarantee or
    even much likelihood of a completely articulate formulation
    being forthcoming or even possible.  Still, it is usually
    worth the effort to try lifting one edge or another of
    these frameworks and backdrops into the light,
    at least for a time.
