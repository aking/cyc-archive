among the more promising threads that i find frayed
nigh unto destruction by the fray of the late grate
bygon year's wear and tear and weary tares, is this
on the prospects of inquiry in panning for ontology.
for ease of reference, here is what has gone before:

Approches To Inquiry Driven Systems

I continue to examine the role of inquiry in ontology development,
with a special focus on the role of abduction in forming concepts.

If we want to build computational support for ontology building,
we will not be able to escape the issues of abductive reasoning.

For my part, I have been trying to resolve a couple of problems:

1.  What is the proper articulation of the inquiry process in terms
    of the various kinds of inference, apodictic and approximate,
    that various thinkers have identified as being relevant to it?

2.  What is the proper placement of inquiry within a theory of signs?

My approach to this problem area has been to track back to the sources
of some of our initial ideas about signs and inquiry, to see if I could
work out for myself what they were thinking and how they moved from one
stage of their thought to the next, and maybe along the way to see if
I can see anything that they may have missed, or omitted to mention
clearly enough.  I am especially interested in the transition that
C.S. Peirce made from syllogistic to relational forms of thinking
about signs and inquiry, as that corresponds to an important task
in what might be called &quot;computational architectronics&quot;, that of
building adequate logical systems on a solid propositional layer.

I have spent a fair amount of time staring at the likes
of the following two structures and trying to figure out
how they fit together, figuratively speaking, of course:

|                        o Sign
|                       /
|                      /
|                     /
|   Object o---------@
|                     \
|                      \
|                       \
|                        o Interpretant

|         o
|         X

| Figure 2.  Three Kinds of Inference

After I had stared at the second picture a very long time,
I came to see that the two approximate forms of inference,
Abduction and Induction, have in common the property that
they bring a middle term into the immediate configuration.
Then I remembered that Aristotle is supposed to have said:
The essence of quick wit lies in grasping the middle term.
But where do these middle terms come from, anyway?  It is
conventional to say that they come in with the abductions
of the cases that first evidence any need to call on them,
and that this is what puts them in the pot for inductions
and deductions to bid for them on any subsequent occasion.
But maybe it would make sense to recognize an independent
process, solely dedicated to finding or making mediations.
Conceived in this way, this process would be a duction in
the opposite direction from Deduction, dub it &quot;Adduction&quot;.

I'm not too committed to this name for the action,
and it has been used on one or two rare occasions
as yet another name for abduction, but I will use
it until I come up with a name that I like better.

One of the nice things about the concept of &quot;adduction&quot;
is that it allows us to strike a compromise with those
who may not even recognize abduction as such but think
that it is induction that leads new concepts into play.

While we are thinking of the kinds of features that
abduction and induction have in common, and also of
the kinds of circumstances that invite the adduction
of a concept to a factual situation, whether we find
the needed concept already available in our ontology
or whether we are led to make up a new concept to fit
the bill, we ought to remind ourselves of the picture
that Peirce gave us of these two operations that was
especially vivid in drawing out the dualities or the
symmetries of their logical structure and function.

Here is brief review:

Abduction to a Case

| M is, for instance, P_1, P_2, P_3, and P_4;
|
| S is P_1, P_2, P_3, and P_4:
|
| Ergo, S is M.
|
| Here the first premiss amounts to this, that
| &quot;P_1, P_2, P_3, and P_4&quot; is a likeness of M,
| and thus the premisses are or represent
| a likeness of the conclusion.

Let the expression

&quot;P_1 &amp; P_2 &amp; P_3 &amp; P_4&quot;

denote the proposition

Q  =  Conjunction (P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4).

Then we may draw the following figure:

|   P_1   P_2         P_3   P_4
|    o     o           o     o

|               \|/*
|                o
|                S
|
| Figure 5.  Abduction to the Case S =&gt; M

Induction to a Rule

| S_1, S_2, S_3, and S_4 are taken as samples of the collection M;
|
| S_1, S_2, S_3, and S_4 are P:
|
| Ergo, All M is P.
|
| Here the first premiss amounts to saying that
| &quot;S_1, S_2, S_3, and S_4&quot; is an index of M.
| Hence the premisses are an index
| of the conclusion.

Let the expression

&quot;S_1 v S_2 v S_3 v S_4&quot;

denote the proposition

L  =  Disjunction (S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4).

Then we may draw the following figure:

Note 3

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Let us now return to John Dewey's &quot;Rainy Day Inquiry&quot;
or &quot;Sign of Rain&quot; example, and this time put it under
the microscope and look at a few of its finer details.
In particular, I can use it to illustrate a couple of
important issues:

a.  The interpretive aspect of inquiry as a semiotic process.
b.  The differential aspect of inquiry as a dynamic process.

For ease of reference, I repeat here the original story:

| A man is walking on a warm day.  The sky was clear the
| last time he observed it;  but presently he notes, while
| occupied primarily with other things, that the air is cooler.
| It occurs to him that it is probably going to rain;  looking up,
| he sees a dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then quickens
| his steps.  What, if anything, in such a situation can be called
| thought?  Neither the act of walking nor the noting of the cold
| is a thought.  Walking is one direction of activity;  looking and
| noting are other modes of activity.  The likelihood that it will
| rain is, however, something 'suggested'.  The pedestrian 'feels'
| the cold;  he 'thinks of' clouds and a coming shower.
|
| John Dewey, 'How We Think', 1910, pages 6-7.

Susan Awbrey and I discussed this example in our article
&quot;Interpretation as Action:  The Risk of Inquiry&quot; that we
gave at a Conference on &quot;Hermeneutics &amp; Human Sciences&quot;
in 1992, a revision of which was subsequently published
in 'Inquiry:  Critical Thinking Across the Disciplines',
Volume 15, No. 1, pages 40-52, (Autumn 1995), which is
available via the Arisbe Web Site or the following link:

<A  HREF="http://www.chss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html">http://www.chss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html</A>
<A  HREF="http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/aboutcsp.htm">http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/aboutcsp.htm</A>

Here is what we said about the sign-theoretic aspects
of the inquiry process that we were able to detect in
Dewey's example:

|                        o Sign (cool air, dark cloud)
|                       /
|                      /
|                     /
|   Object o---------@
|   (rain)            \
|                      \
|                       \
|                        o Interpretant (thought of rain)
|
| Figure 7.  Sign Relation in Dewey's &quot;Sign of Rain&quot;

| In this narrative we can identify the characters of
| the sign relation as follows:  'coolness' is a Sign of
| the Object 'rain', and the Interpretant is 'the thought
| of the rain's likelihood'.  In his 1910 description of
| reflective thinking Dewey distinguishes two phases,
| &quot;a state of perplexity, hesitation, doubt&quot; and
| &quot;an act of search or investigation&quot; (Dewey 1991, 9),
| comprehensive stages which are further refined in his
| later model of inquiry.  In this example, reflection
| is the act of the interpreter which establishes a fund
| of connections between the sensory shock of coolness
| and the objective danger of rain, by way of his
| impression that rain is likely.  But reflection is
| more than irresponsible speculation.  In reflection
| the interpreter acts to charge or defuse the thought
| of rain (the probability of rain in thought) by seeking
| other signs which this thought implies and evaluating
| the thought according to the results of this search.

Next time I will take up the differential aspect
of inquiry as a dynamic process of theory change.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

This time I will take up the differential aspect
of inquiry as a dynamic process of theory change.

| Note on Relevance &amp; Utility of Miniature Models:
|
| For reasons of the briefest possible exposition,
| I have elected to discuss the subject matter in
| the medium of a just barely non-trivial example.
| In order to appreciate the point and the thrust
| of any such radically impoverished test example
| it is necessary to recognize the application of
| one or two limiting principles to the axiomatic
| expressions of its thus-purported circumstances:
|
| 1.  Gensym Fallacy.  The sense and the significance of
|     the circumstantial description is circumscribed by
|     the logical form and the number of terms it enjoys.
|
| 2.  Ginseng Truism.  The sense and the significance of
|     the circumstantial description is circumscribed by
|     the logical form and the number of terms it enjoys.
|
| In particular, even though it is bound to appear for the moment that
| I am restricting my presentation to &quot;axiom change operators&quot; (ACO's)
| that act locally on the points of a given logical configuration in
| a fixed lattice of propositional facts or terms, it will be clear
| that a &quot;zeroth order theory&quot; (ZOT) that is presented by a finite
| set of &quot;zeroth order axioms&quot; (ZOA) is itself equivalent to the
| conjunction of these axioms, and thus to a single proposition
| in the appropriate &quot;zeroth order ordering&quot; (ZOO).  In effect,
| one whole ZOO is encapsulated by a single point in another.
|
| Anyway, I think that is right, but it's a thought whose
| consequences I am still struggling to grasp fully, and
| so maybe I will eventually discover a problem with it.

Returning to the example in question, let me now draw
a more expansive picture of the &quot;Rainy Day&quot; situation,
one that adduces to the account some consideration of
what our peripatetic or precipitate hero was probably
doing and thinking, however consciously or other-wise,
just slightly before the imaginary events in question.

You see, our hero did not begin his life with the
shock of cool air on his skin, well, not on this
particular, late ambulatory occasion, but had
a prior distribution of default assumptions
about what his day was going to be like.

Just to extrapolate in a plausible vein of our imagination,
let us play along and say that the initial facts were thus:

A_1  =  Air warm

B_1  =  Balmy day

C_1  =  Clear sky

Pulling the &quot;conventional contingency&quot; or &quot;customary connection&quot; trick,
let us then relativize the array of this data in the following fashion:

C =  Current situation

C =&gt; A_1

C =&gt; B_1

C =&gt; C_1

For the moment, let this figure of a &quot;current situation&quot; C
be one that is allowed to &quot;go with the flow&quot;, letting its
letter be re-used to anchor whatever the case may become.

Now I do not know if it has to be the case that these three
features of the current situation had ever been entertained
by our ambler in any particular order, but we might suppose
their relative consistency as consisting in some such scene
as this:  The hiker has formed a prior assumption about the
Case that applies to the current situation, let's say, that
the day is balmy, C =&gt; B_1, an assumption that he will keep
as a default to continue in the same way until there arises
a reason to think otherwise.  Further, we may imagine quite
plausibly that a Rule of the form B_1 =&gt; A_1 can be applied
to the Case C =&gt; B_1 to deduce the expectation of a certain
Fact, namely, that the current situation will feature among
its phenomena the qualities of the air being warm, C =&gt; A_1.

So this logical set-up, or the likes of it, is what we may assume,
at least, plausibly enough for our currently illustrative purpose,
as the logical environ into which our soon to be inquiring ambler
strolls one fine and for the moment sunny day.

The rest you know.  The cooler air, A_2, sensually contests
and logically contradicts the continuing assumption of the
prior condition A_1, demanding a fresh evaluation of the
conditioning assumption B_1, altering it into the new
hypothesis B_2, boding rain, which abduced Case is
corrobated to a moderate degree by looking up and
spying a cloud in the sky, C_2.

Figure 8 manages to sum it all up in a fairly consummate fashion:

|   A_1         A_2                     C_1         C_2

Note 5

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

I have adjusted the title to reflect the fact I will try to keep
this thread tightly anchored to problems of ontology development,
the application of inquiry to the process, and the types of
software tools that we will need to carry it out.

I will also try to fix a more narrow bead on the points
where inquiry processes lead us to place new concepts into
an existing ontology, to modify a selection of old concepts
already there, or to trash the whole theory and start afresh.

We have have already seen several clues that these ontology tools
will have to go beyond the kinds of theorem provers that we have
gotten accusutomed to seeing in the past.  Just to mention one
consideration, these theorem provers have been specialized for
particular subsets of deductive reasoning, and as a result they
are not all that well or easily integrated with the ways of their
more inductive database and statistical cousins, and they provide
very little support for concept formation, hypothesis generation,
and other sorts of abductive tasks.
