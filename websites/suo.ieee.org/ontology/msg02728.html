Mike,

	I agree there are "countless worthy issues to focus on," but the SUO
WG is chartered to develop a standards document.  Unless someone proposes a
starting point, the group has nothing to focus on.  

	Candidate documents have been posted, but not proposed as group
efforts.   There's a big difference.  

	I don't want to speak for any members, but I believe we will see one
or more proposals in the coming weeks. 

Jim

I could not agree more with Nicola's comment regarding the conduct of the
SUO list. I disagree with Jim that "Our problem has been lack of something
to focus on."  Oh contrairre. There are countless worthy issues to focus on.
The lack of progress, as Nicola suggests is due to the general unwillingness
of the group to focus on a few issues at a time, to make and record
progress, etc. And of course, not to stray willy nilly into topics of little
relevance. There was a perfect opportunity to record progress by having
papers submitted to SUO - this was not taken up. I am not pointing blame
anywhere, for I also failed to contribute a paper, due to other priorities.
I regret that the signal to noise ratio does not allow me to participate as
I would like to. I regret missing out on some of the truly excellent
discussions from which I learn a lot, most particularly due to Pat Hayes'
prolific contributions.

While I am on a roll...  I also tend to agree with many of the points Pat
has made recently, which unfortunately point to the apparent fact that there
is no compelling evidence that a STANDARD UO will be of value. I'm not even
sure of the value of any UO, in most contexts. I heartily agree that
starting from the top is not a good way to get a USEFUL ontology, as I have
argued many times.  Our experience in applying the enterprise ontology
(which from the perspective of our application, was a very abstract Upperish
Level Ontology for enterprise concepts) was that there was only one case
where it was even possible to connect to concepts in the EO, and there was
no real benefit in doing this. There is a huge gaping gulf between
application-specific ontologies and upper level ones, and it is not only
difficult to bridge the gap, there seems to be no point in doing so.  I
agree with Pat that one needs to start in the MIDDLE where the real action
is, in one's given domain. Then, on!
!
 a demand-pull basis, add upperish-level concepts as they are required.  

On the other hand, I am not so confident as Pat that the whole effort is a
waste, and doomed to fail. Having a SINGLE upper ontology, may well fail,
but having components to choose from may well be useful. I still have a
sense that the way to proceed is as follows for a given domain, at whatever
level.
1. Identify important concepts.
2. identify different ways to model them
3. Split the differences into two categories:
a. Those that are superficial, and are mere choices with minimal
consequence, all may have the same models, for example.
b. Those that are IMPORTANT - such as those identified by Pat in his survey
of time representations.

4. For the non-important differences, choose one that seems to work,even if
it is arbitrary. Anyone who does not like it, can choose to use their own,
and map to/from it.
5. For the important ones, develop independent and presumably incompatible
theories which one can choose from.

None of this is necessarily new, having been said by various folk in varous
ways.

I will stop this less than well-articulated ramble...

Nicola,

	The message volume has not been the cause of our lack of progress,
it has just filled the void.  Our problem has been lack of something to
focus on.  Only one starter document has been proposed and the group did not
accept it (though it did pass in a straw poll).

	Others have posted work, as you have, but have not been willing to
actually propose it as a group effort, probably because they didn't have the
time or resources to champion it any further.  This is understandable, but a
standard will only be developed if it has a core group willing to champion
it all the way.  

	Unless we have this key ingredient, no measure of good management
will lead this group to success.

	


Jim

&gt;Nicola,
&gt;
&gt;	Have you given any further thought to submitting any of your work as
&gt;a starter document for SUO.  As you know, the group needs one or more
&gt;documents to focus its efforts on.

Dear James,

	The paper we have submitted to the IJCAI SUO Workshop (which 
will be presented at the IJCAI ws on ontologies) cannot be intended 
as a starter ontology, but can certainly be considered among the 
starter documents. There is no attempt to be complete, though. A 
preliminary version of our IKF reference ontology is scheduled by the 
end of this year, and we should able to announce a  preliminary 
top-level before Summer.

	A further (indirect) contribution is my recent review of 
Sowa's book and especially his top-level ontology. Since the current 
merged ontology is based on it, this is implicitly a criticism to the 
merged ontology. I have no time for an open, endless discussion on 
this, but I will certainly welcome specific, focused observations.

	In the meanwhile, our own contribution to the SUO initiative 
will necessarily be very limited, mainly because of the fact that 
this group hasn't been able to implement a strict issue-based 
discussion methodology, nor the "bookshelf of results" proposed in 
the past by Mike Uschold and myself. To me, the inhability of 
achieving this and the lack of control of out-of-focus discussions on 
the list reveals a serious failure of this initiative. This is also 
the reason of my abstension regarding the Chair elections.

	A further reason of disappointment is the way the IEEE SUO 
workshop has been managed. Still I don't know how many papers have 
been submitted and selected. I suspect that ours was the only paper. 
This could have been a useful opportunity to force people to condense 
their proposals in papers, but apparently it didn't work.

	That's it, for now. I will be more active when this list will 
be more efficient, and when a list of issues and proposals, with 
defenders and opponents for each of them, will be posted on the Web 
site. I know it is difficult, but it is the only way to proceed.

Best wishes,

-- Nicola

P.S.: I am answering to you only since you sent me a personal 
message; I encourage you to forward this to the whole list, however.
