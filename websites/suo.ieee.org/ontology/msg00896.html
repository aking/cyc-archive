Dear Matthew,

Please see comments below.

&gt; &gt; PJ: ... I would like to make the suggestion that the SUO group
&gt; &gt; should compare the representational features of EXPRESS with
&gt; &gt; KIF, to decide
&gt; &gt; whether EXPRESS may in fact be a better starting point for
&gt; &gt; representation of
&gt; &gt; SUO. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each language?
&gt;
&gt; MW: Well, before anyone expends too much effort on this exercise,
&gt; perhaps I
&gt; should say that one of the reasons I am here is a dissatisfaction with
&gt; EXPRESS. We have already started developing a language called EXIST
&gt; (EXpression if Information based on logic and Set Theory) to
&gt; address some of
&gt; these issues. We had originally rejected KIF as being just too
&gt; difficult to
&gt; understand. EXIST is not as clear as some ACE would be, but I do
&gt; think it is
&gt; easier to understand than KIF.
&gt;
&gt; MW: EXPRESS is an entity relationship language, which is intended
&gt; to define
&gt; data structures, rather than axioms, although it has an extensive
&gt; constraint
&gt; specification language. Overall it is a very extensive language, with
&gt; roughly the same capability as the static part of the UML, for those
&gt; familiar with it. This complexity is one of the issues, plus some of the
&gt; basic limitations of the entity relationship paradigm. When you want to
&gt; design a system to implement an ontology, EXPRESS is a good choice (so an
&gt; EXPRESS model of KIF could be useful).

PJ: Thanks for your comments, and also those given separately by Mike
Uschold and John Velman. These responses basically satisfy my suggestion
that the SUO give some consideration to the use of EXPRESS, and advantages
and disadvantages vs. KIF. Of course, I accept your advice that EXPRESS
would not be suitable for SUO.

PJ: Matthew, how far along is the EXIST language? Can you provide pointers
to more information about it? Do you think it might be a good starting point
for use in SUO?


&gt; &gt; Also, I would like to make the suggestion that the SUO group
&gt; &gt; should consider
&gt; &gt; leveraging EPISTLE and other models already developed in EXPRESS as a
&gt; &gt; starting point for developing SUO.
&gt;
&gt; MW: This is a better idea. The EPISTLE Core Model is designed to be a
&gt; foundation that can integrate a range of ontologies (or data
&gt; models). It is
&gt; not perfect, but it is the current result of some 15 years
&gt; concerted effort
&gt; by a range of people.


PJ: I am glad to hear this. I hope that SUO'ers will give very serious
consideration to use of EPISTLE as a starting point.


&gt; MW: Many of the other models in SC4 are also useful, but in general more
&gt; specialised. So when you want to know how to make a 3D geometric
&gt; representation of something, or incorporate a piece part product
&gt; catalogue,
&gt; we probably have what you need.
&gt;
&gt; MW: It is worth pointing out that the representation of information about
&gt; something, which seems to exercise so many people here, is rather well
&gt; understood and taken for granted.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems to me there could be some promise in both these efforts. For
&gt; &gt; example, you have written that the following concepts
&gt; &gt; recently listed by Pat
&gt; &gt; Hayes could probably fit into EPISTLE:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; an 'information-bearing object' (see my long comment in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; recent message);
&gt; &gt; &gt; a piece of a certain kind of cloth which was used in evidence
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a trial;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the color of that piece of cloth;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the act of breaking an egg by hitting it on the side of a bowl;
&gt; &gt; &gt; a style of dress used by a certain social class in
&gt; &gt; &gt; 17th-century France;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the shape of Marilyn Monroe's left ankle;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the cause of the Concorde disaster;
&gt; &gt; &gt; a dish (in the sense that Eggs Benedict is a dish, ie a something
&gt; &gt; &gt; that could be a menu item; as opposed to any particular example of
&gt; &gt; &gt; that dish, or the symbols on the menu describing it.)
&gt;
&gt; MW: Yes. I still have to respond to Adam's request for how they fit.


PJ: Your response to Adam's request was recently posted, and is very
interesting. I look forward to learning more about EPISTLE.


&gt; &gt; EXPRESS, EPISTLE and the other models developed in EXPRESS, have the
&gt; &gt; advantage of having been developed over several years by many
&gt; &gt; people in an
&gt; &gt; open, standards-based effort.
&gt;
&gt; MW: One of the key things we can bring is experience of
&gt; developing standards
&gt; in this area. The SUO does not have to suffer all the mistakes that we
&gt; managed to make.


PJ: I think this is a very important point. Any insights that you can
provide should be very helpful to the group.


&gt; &gt; My understanding is that they
&gt; &gt; are publicly
&gt; &gt; available standards, which could be leveraged by SUO. Their
&gt; &gt; development has
&gt; &gt; also been focused on practical, industry-based applications
&gt; &gt; which may be
&gt; &gt; consonant with SUO's objectives. For all of these reasons,
&gt; &gt; plus the general
&gt; &gt; expressiveness of EXPRESS, they may be better starting points
&gt; &gt; and long term
&gt; &gt; approaches than either of the current alternatives, which
&gt; &gt; seem to be: a)
&gt; &gt; starting with a relatively new "merged ontology" developed in
&gt; &gt; KIF; b) going
&gt; &gt; with CYC, if a suitable copyright release letter can be obtained.
&gt;
&gt; MW: I think the reality is that there are a number of starting
&gt; points, each
&gt; of which is valuable in its own right. What I think we need to do is take
&gt; some time to understand these, and see how we candraw from each of them in
&gt; the most appropriate way. At the least they each represent some
&gt; requirements
&gt; we need to address.

PJ: Again, I agree about the potential for multiple starting points, and
need to identify requirements. It might be a good idea for SUO to explore
multiple paths in parallel.
