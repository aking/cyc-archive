&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; Please note that neither "meaning" nor "proposition" is used
&gt; in the definitions.  The purpose of the formalism is to give
&gt; some meaning to the word "meaning" and to give a formal
&gt; definition for the word "proposition".

Yes, but, er, if your patent formulations did not compare
in some favorable way with what is ordinarily understood
by the words "meaning" and "proposition", or unless you
are able to give some account of these concepts that is
independent of formal symbolic manipulations, then it
appears that you are already bound to charge yourself
with the fault that -- how did you put it when you
consigned my calculus to the Frege-Russell line? --
"treats the rules of [translation] as primitives that
are not justified by their effects on truth conditions",
thus infringing the definition and the horizon of logic
as "the formal conditions for the truth of representations",
in effect, reversing the bias that is more usual of buying the
emphasis "formal" at the expense of "truth" and "representation".

&gt; &gt; I had decided, most graciously, I thought, to permit
&gt; &gt; the words "meaning" and "proposition" to go on being
&gt; &gt; used in all of those ambiguous and equivocal manners
&gt; &gt; that appear to be their eternal lot among humankind,
&gt; &gt; for my part resorting, if need be, to these tactics:
&gt; 
&gt; There is nothing ambiguous or equivocal about the word
&gt; "proposition" as I defined it, and the word "meaning"
&gt; appears only as the name of a particular kind of
&gt; semiotic morphism, which I have called
&gt; a "meaning-preserving translation".

My needs for clarification here have always been rather simple.
I ask the same questions of everybody whose usage of words like
"meaning" and "proposition" I want to try to understand, simply
for the purpose of being able to continue the discussion with
any hope of mutual comprehension.  Let me try to put them in
the form of a questionnaire:

1.  I regard the meaning of a sign or expression to be:
 
    a.  its denotation  (= object, referent, bedeutung).
    b.  its connotation (= interpretant, sense, sinn).
    c.  either of the above.
    d.  none of the above.
    e.  other (go to essay section).

2.  I regard a proposition, in use, not mention, to be:

    a.  a sign (= expression, sentence), either token or type,
               not excluding the interpretants of other signs.
    b.  an object, either abstract or concrete, token or type,
               just for example, the denotation of a sentence.
    c.  either of the above.
    d.  none of the above.
    e.  other (go to essay section).

For example, in another note you made this statement:

&gt; Your primary objection seems to be to my choice of the
&gt; word "proposition" for the "meaning of a sentence".

But that is not the problem.  I can take you at your word
that "the meaning of a sentence is a proposition" and yet
be confused about the status of "meaning" and "proposition",
because these words are characterized in relation to each
other with no anchor that I can find on solid ground, so
my doubts about one cannot be resolved, due to my doubts
about the status of the other.

For instance, if you say that the sense of meaning of a sentence
that you have in mind here is denotative, then I would know that
you mean a proposition in use to be regarded as a kind of object.
In contrast, if you say that a proposition in its use is a sign,
then I would know that you interpret it as the interpretant sign
of a sentential expression.

I have gone back to your definitions and read them again,
and I am still confused about how I should understand your
use of the words "meaning" and "proposition".  Perhaps it
was that use of Peirce's statement about propositions,
which I still cannot read as referring to anything else
but propositional expressions as a class of signs.

This is as far as I can get on this try.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; &gt; However, John's clarifications here allow me, perhaps,
&gt; &gt; subject to approval, of course, to resolve the issue
&gt; &gt; rather more quickly, by redubbing what I am after
&gt; &gt; as "object preserving transformations" (OPT's),
&gt; &gt; and so that is what I will opt for next.
&gt; 
&gt; You can think of an MPT as a semiotic morphism f that
&gt; maps a sign s1 in language L1 to a sign s2 in language L2
&gt; while preserving the interpretant i and the object o.
&gt; 
&gt; The translation f maps the "meaning triangle" &lt;s1, i, o&gt;
&gt; to another meaning triangle &lt;s2, i, o&gt; where s2 = f(s1).
&gt; In that sense, f preserves both the interpretant and
&gt; the object while translating the sign from L1 to L2.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, an MPT is both an object-preserving translation
&gt; (OPT) and an interpretant-preserving translation (IPT).
&gt; It replaces the sign of the triad while leaving the
&gt; other two corners unchanged.
&gt;
