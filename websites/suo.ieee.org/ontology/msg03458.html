JA = Jon Awbrey
JS = Jim Schoening

JS: I hope nobody on this list objects,
    but Jon Awbrey has requested
    a thread be moved to this list.

Welcome to Walden Pond.  You will find this to be a quiet place for reflection,
without all that volume of screaming about to much volume of screaming about ...

JA: 3.  I am prepared to argue that my present lines of contribution have
        more pertinence to the Scope &amp; Purpose of the SUO Working Group,
        a higher quality overall, and a better rationale on many points
        than various parallels in the current Starter Documents.

JS: 'Pertinence to the Scope and Purpose' is not good enough.
     We could spend eternity on things that meet this criteria.
     We are chartered to develop a standards document, not
     advance the field of upper ontologies.  Your 1000+
     (I'm guessing) postings have not contributed much
     of any standards words.

We spent a lot of time on that S&amp;P.  I should think that
keeping its guidelines before us would be worth something.
But I would like to ask that you not single me out if you
are not prepared to defend the same points against everyone.
This tactic of saying &quot;pick a document, any document&quot; and
let's push some standard words around on paper so we'll
look official does not seem to be a line that anybody
else buys.  I get the sense that this compulsion goes
back to a sense of a proper timeline for the project.
If you are on the 2 year plan and others are on the
10 year plan, then it is inevitable that there will
be some friction about what we should be doing at
this point in time.  Since I am scarcely alone in
taking the long view, I believe that this issue
is already one that belongs on the main floor.

On a similar note, I have a different sense of the role of research
in any sensible enterprise, and I am hardly alone in this, so there
is no need for me to be the martyr for this point of view.  I recall
the old Bureau of Standards -- wrote them a letter in the 4th grade
and received all sorts of peachy keen brochures and stuff from them --
one of the premier research institutions in the United States back
then.  Don't know what happened to them -- we didn't stay in touch.
Anyway, I think this is an issue where you should respect the sense
of the group.  I will.

JS: You have stated your dislike for both started documents,
    offered much of any specific help in improving them.
    In standards development, criticisms without suggested
    improvements are of little value.  Also, the fact that
    you don't like what this group is working on does not
    give you the right to set your own agenda (i.e. conduct
    research) and eat up bandwidth with it.  And the fact
    that don't think the group can succeed without your
    research work does not give you the right to.

Not exactly, I have my differential criticisms of them, ranging
from mild (IFF) to severe (SUMO).  In fact, it was the inclusion
of IFF's category-theoretic POV, if not the specific document,
that gave me enough hope to re-up on the main list, though
I have not said that publicly before, for fear that some
folks would hold it against them.  Again, I have to keep
reminding you, I feel that this WG will not be able to
evaluate the general CAT and specific IFF proposals
in an informed manner without a diligent effort on
the part of its proponents and supporters to clear
up many popular misapprehensions about the entire
category-theoretic approach.  And again, I think
that I have done as much yeomen service in this
connection as any of its proposers, for example,
all of the work that I put into the selections
from Lambek &amp; Scott, a classic in the field,
and very relevant to our logical needs here:

Lambek &amp; Scott, 'Higher Order Categorical Logic'

JS: If you believe the group cannot succeed without your research, there is a proper way
    to submit your work.  You should either submit your own starter document, or submit
    comments to the other starter documents.  But it is not acceptable to conduct this
    research in this forum without any relationship to the work of this group.
    Again, it is not enough that it relates to the Scope and Purpose.

Your are ignoring my earlier clarifications of what I mean by the term &quot;research&quot;,
which is just one of the many reasons why I dislike off-list discussiona about
substantive issues, since now I will have to deja vu it all over again:

JA, quoting JA (Fri, 30 Nov 2001 14:56:44 -0500):

    | I do not propose that it become a &quot;general research forum&quot;.
    | If I felt that I was engaged in that order of activity,
    | I would go straightaway to the Ontology List or some
    | other discussion group to post my contributions.
    | I would even do this with material that I think
    | is relevant to SUO but in a long-range sense,
    | or of a purely auxiliary or tutorial benefit,
    | as I have done with my selections from sundry
    | textbooks on logic, math, category theory, etc.,
    | that many people here would need to make informed
    | contributions at some point in the foreseeable but
    | more or less remote future of our work in the group.

JA, quoting JA (Fri, 30 Nov 2001 21:28:36 -0500):

    | ok, i see now, you have mistaken the intent of what i am saying.
    | when i speak of a &quot;research-based effort&quot;, i mean going out and
    | becoming familiar with the relevant masses of research that have
    | already been piled up.  i have no desire to work on impossible
    | dreams, and would not waste my time or yours on escapdes where
    | i did not already believe that the solutions are lying nearby.
    | there is a backlog of already been conquered problems in math
    | and elsewhere that is like gold mines of available technology
    | just waiting to be adapted and transferred.  in some cases
    | that are material to our problems, the backlog goes back
    | one or two hundred years, and i blame the ivory tower
    | types for doing such a poor job of making this known.
    | other cases involve unpublished work, done by poor
    | swabs like me, who are just dying to see society
    | use our work for something before we die.  i am
    | willing to do the work to make all of this bear
    | fruit on the suo work, but it is getting to be
    | a royal pain in the neck all the screaming
    | that goes on every time anybody tries to
    | broach a new keg of ideas at this party.

JA: 4.  You do not seem to get the fact that I am doing my level best
        to accord you the professional service of telling you exactly
        how these prospective standards will be judged by the academic,
        professional, and user communities with which I am very familiar.
        I simply think that it is better that the Group should hear about
        it now, while there is still time to fix it, rather than waiting
        to be roundly ridiculed by the first elect body of external experts
        to which these inept pretensions of expertise present themselves.
        Hear me now, and believe me later, as I think the line goes.

JS: Standards groups start with a document and improve it.  It helps little
    to just criticize it.  You should help to improve one of both documents.
    If you don't think either are worth your input, you should either submit
    your own starter document, listen quietly, or leave.  You should not eat
    up bandwidth with your research.

Again, I am hardly the only person here who believes that both of these documents
are too immature/premature to be worthy of closing off general discussion.  It was
constantly advertised to us in the run-up to the votes on these documents that we
should in no way be putting ourselves in ball &amp; chain by approving them.

Different champions have different levels of receptivity to suggestions.
I have had way too many week-long discussions with the SUMO folk trying
to give them simple info about textbook matters, and they will just keep
doing what they do until some authority they respect, if any, tells them
that 2 + 2 really is 4, but I have wasted all the breath I plan to there.

JA:  I request that you present reasoned arguments for your so far completely
     bald objections to the pertinence, the quality, and the rationality of
     my current contributions, or else cease to assert them.

JS: I don't question the quality or rationality of your postings.
    I have explained why they are pertinent.

JA:  With respect to procedural issues, the role of research, a reasonable timeline
     for the project, and many other issues of that nature, my positions are quite
     the same as more seasoned members of this group.

JS: The charter rules, which is to develop a standards document,
    not advance the field of ontology.  If certain members don't
    think this is achievable, they are free to not participate,
    but they can't change the charter to focus on research.

This is incomprehesible to me,
and I believe to many others.
In a previous note you stated:

JS: It may be true that technology is not mature enough to develop a SUO, but
    that is our charter so we will try.  We are not chartered to conduct research.
    It is better to try to standardize on current technology and risk failure than
    to become a research forum and assure we will never be finished.

Writing a good enough ontology standard is not something that folks
can just spin out of their own bitty brains one fine summer's day.
I think of all the mentors I have had through the years who said:

JA, quoting his audible hallucination:

| You want to use the &quot;appropriate best current&quot; (ABC) information and technology,
| but until you do your literature review you don't really know what ABC is.

I'm so glad I finally get to echo that sentiment.

JS: If members want to do research, I've a couple times offered to help set up
    an IEEE task force, which could become an 'IEEE Technical Committee'.
    Nobody showed interest.

You keep using the word &quot;research&quot; in a way that I clarified was not my sense.

JA:  In these regards, I request that you quit picking on me --
     just because you can -- and start picking on somebody
     your own size.

JS:  You are receiving more guidance than others because you post far more messages
     than anyone else.  If you were to drop back to a much lower number, nobody would
     complain.  Others do post the same types of research postings as you, but small
     enough quantities that don't cause a problem.  But I have sent guidance to others,
     and most of them follow it, while you do not cooperate.  This is why I am pushing
     this so hard with you.

I don't understand this.  If this were just an election or an opinion poll,
then a person who votes more times than others would of course be subject to
special sanction.  But if this is a matter of doing work toward common goals,
then nobody normally complains if somebody else does more work than them.
So the problem reduces to the question of whether I am doing work toward
espoused common goals.  I believe that I am.  If others complain to you
that I am not, then I ask that they present their complaints in public
forum, so that the objections and objectors can themselves be known.
That's the way I've always been told it should be done.

JS: Please respond to my points, but please don't twist my words.

Vice Versa.

Jon
