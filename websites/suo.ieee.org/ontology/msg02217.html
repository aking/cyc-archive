&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This can't be right, as the free variable "x" occurs on the right
&gt; &gt; side of the &lt;=&gt; but not on the left; it just sits there like a
&gt; &gt; pronoun with no associated context to give it meaning.   
&gt; 
&gt; MW: x is intended here to be a constant. It is relevant to just this one 
&gt; act of giving. Though I would agree it is a bad choice of name.

Then I'm even more confused.  Is your intention to introduce a distinct
variable C for every three names N1, N2, and N3 in your language and
then provide an axiom of the form

(&lt;=&gt; (gives N1 N2 N3)
     (and (giving C)
          (giver C N1)
          (receiver C N2)
          (given C N3)

for all such C, N1, N2, and N3?  That seems very awkward indeed.  What
does such a C denote if the thing denoted by N1 does not give the thing
denoted by N2 the thing denoted by N3?  A nonexistent event?  A merely
possible event?  I really don't think this is what you want to do.  I
think what you want is to guarantee a giving event *whenever* three
things stand in the gives relation.  That has to be stated generally
with a quantifier as I suggest below, not with constants, which force
you to find something for them to denote.

&gt; &gt; Also, you are using "gives" ambiguously here. If I recall another of
&gt; &gt; your recent posts correctly, you are using "(gives x)" to mean
&gt; &gt; something like "x is a giving", i.e., an act or event of giving.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You are quite right. The two gives have different meanings. In
&gt; a later version I have used gives1 and gives2 (or some such) to
&gt; distinguish them.

I'll stick with "giving" to apply to events.

&gt; &gt; If so, I think what you're after is the following (I change to the
&gt; &gt; more mnemonic (and KIF'ish) variable "?e"):
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary book1)
&gt; &gt;      (exists (?e) 
&gt; &gt;              (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt;                   (giver ?e John)
&gt; &gt;                   (receiver ?e Mary)
&gt; &gt;                   (given ?e book1))))
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; MW: Well no, as I said in my response to Fred it is necessary to
&gt; ensure that there is exactly one e for this case, which is probably
&gt; best denoted by a constant. 

Except that using a constant doesn't do a thing to guarantee uniqueness
(at least, not without adding an ungainly bunch of "unique names" axioms
-- unique naming might be a convenient constraint to implement in a
database perhaps, but it is unlovely, to say the least, in a formal
ontology).  Nothing you've said would rule out there being another
constant denoting an event distint from your original in which John is
giver, Mary receiver, and book1 the given. If you want uniqueness, then
you do that by means of quantififiers as well, supplementing the above
as follows:

(&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary book1)
     (exists (?e) 
             (and (giving ?e)
                  (giver ?e John)
                  (receiver ?e Mary)
                  (given ?e book1)
                  (forall (?e')
                          (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
                                   (giver ?e' John)
                                   (receiver ?e' Mary)
                                   (given ?e' book1))
                              (= ?e ?e'))))))
                     
If it now turns out that (gives John Mary book1), then you are warranted
by the above in *introducing* a new name, which will denote the unique
event that is guaranteed by the above axiom.  But should John *not* give
book1 to Mary, then, again by the above, there is no corresponding
event in which John is giver, etc (and no embarrassing constant around
seeking a nonexistent denotation).  Of course, I think what you *really* 
want is the purely generalized form of this axiom, of which the above 
is just an instance:

(forall (?x ?y ?z)
        (&lt;=&gt; (gives ?x ?y ?z)
             (exists (?e) 
                     (and (giving ?e)
                          (giver ?e ?x)
                          (receiver ?e ?y)
                          (given ?e ?z)
                          (forall (?e')
                                  (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
                                           (giver ?e' ?x)
                                           (receiver ?e' ?y)
                                           (given ?e' ?z))
                                      (= ?e ?e')))))))

&gt; &gt; What all this means for the triadicity debate I have no idea, as I
&gt; &gt; have no idea what triadicity in the Mystical Peircean Sense is all
&gt; &gt; about.  I would understand the above axiom as nothing more than a
&gt; &gt; way of providing a (perhaps) more robust analysis of the giving
&gt; &gt; relation by enlarging one's ontology to include events.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You make a good point here ...

Then I'll quit while I'm ahead!  :-)
