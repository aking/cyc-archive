John, 
	.	While I agree with the thrust of your sentiments, and in any
case vastly preferred the logicality of WordPerfect, surely the driving
factor is that Microsoft has by far the bulk of the market, and many of us
are required to use the software corporately provided and mandated by our IT
people.  

	.	Where I do, and have previously, worked, use of
non-corporate software is prohibited without special case acceptance of a
business justification, and will be wiped from one's computer overnight if
attempted. 

	.	If MS Word can't support it, then many of us will have no
means of accessing it. 

	.	The fact is they have the market sewn up for the time being.
I suggest this won't be overcome till serious analysis and response to the
matter occurs at either international level, such as WTO or similar, or in
the main economic groups, such as NAFTA, USA, EU, etc. 

	.	My guess this won't happen for at least a half decade, no
matter how irritated little people like us may be irritated by it.

Jim, Graham, et al.,
I agree with Jim that we need to focus:

&gt;I think the fundamental problem is that we don't know what documents
&gt;we're really working on....

One way to focus the discussion is to make a policy that every
message to the SUO list should either

1.	Reply to an existing thread.
2.	Explicitly propose a new thread that addresses an issue related to
one or more documents in the SUO list of expert contributions.
3.	Submit a new expert contribution for placement in the official SUO
list, and start a thread that explains why that document should be
considered.
4.	Submit a news item that includes or refers to some topic (research
publication, business development, or conference) that is directly relevant
to the SUO and explain why it is relevant to the SUO.

&gt;Adam, if you want people to participate in the Merged Ontology, I
&gt;suggest you propose it as an effort of the group (but don't call it a base
&gt;document :) ).  Others with documents should do the same, if they feel they
&gt;have a starting point and want more participation.

I believe that the suggestion proposed above would help to achieve that
goal.  If every new thread had to make an explicit reference to some
document on the SUO list, each message on that thread would imply one
mini-vote for the relevance of that document.
&gt;As for unfocused dialogue, without a focus I can't see much harm in
&gt;the current talk.  The solution is not to restrict it, but to displace it
&gt;with something to focus on.

I think that some policy along the lines suggested above would encourage
people to think about relevance before they send off a random note.  It
wouldn't prevent people from introducing new material, but it would
encourage them to look at the existing document list and either (1) add some
significiant contribution to it or (2) justify their new note by explaining
its relevance to what is already there.
John Sowa
