&gt; As Kevin knows very well, semiotics deals directly with the issue of
&gt; the primeness of non-addressable subjects, over addressable subjects.

These words sound familiar, in a disturbing way,
but before I go flying off on a tangent, perhaps
it would be better if I asked you what you mean
by them, I mean, &quot;addressable&quot;, &quot;non-addressable&quot;,
&quot;primeness&quot;, and &quot;subjects&quot;.

&gt; Kevin and John Norseen and a few others around the
&gt; world have made this &quot;semiotics&quot; the focus of new work.

Okay, just as long as they know where they are in line --
a line whose lead was payed out in the coinage of Locke,
a line whose many-stranded cable was twist together by
C.S. Peirce.  It seams that the worled has now become
rife with many, all too many brave little tailors who
would claim the &quot;Seven In One Blow&quot; belt for having
reinvented the twill, and I am getting well past
worn out by all the not-so-new-tangled factions.

&gt; It is this new work that leads to the definitive mechanisms
&gt; that will trigger, IMO, the true knowledge revolution.  I am
&gt; just now becoming aware of Jon's contributions.  It is nice
&gt; to see a new force.

It is nice to be (seen as) a new force.

&gt; I remember as I began to understand Daniel Rivers-Moore's
&gt; tutorial on topic maps, and specifically the issue of the
&gt; importance of treating the addressable subjects with some
&gt; increased status.  A status that is proper, only in
&gt; a post later Wittgenstein mental attitude. (I mean,
&gt; having understood the more mature Wittgenstein where
&gt; language is used to address the world but cannot be
&gt; confused as &quot;being the world&quot;.)

Maturity like that depends on being really immature to start,
and I think that I can speak with the vice of experience here.

&gt; The computer system (all networks every-where) have an existence
&gt; that is modeled perfectly as a finite state machine.  This is due
&gt; to the crisp nature of computing.  A bit is either set or it is not.
&gt; 
&gt; So the formalism that Russell and logical positivist wanted to reflect
&gt; perfectly the natural world do in fact reflect (or can reflect) perfectly
&gt; the &quot;artificial world&quot; (to use Herbert Simon's term).

What Russell did not seem to grasp is that a perfectly isomorphic model
of the world is almost totally useless for the sake of any live purpose.
What is required is lots and lots and lots of diverse homomorphisms, as
in tools as basic as category theory, fourier analysis, &amp; vector spaces.

&gt; The topic maps conceptual model is powerful in that it recognizes that the
&gt; computer system has its own &quot;ontology&quot;, even if this ontology is &quot;non-complex&quot;.
&gt; When we as a community understand this wonderful fact, that the addressable world
&gt; is addressable in a simple fashion, then we may also recognize that the natural world
&gt; does not have this quality.
&gt; 
&gt; The natural world is not addressable in a simple fashion, without an insult
&gt; to the system being addressed.  Treating a rain forest as an economic prize
&gt; leads to the insult (harm) to the world in that region.  (for example).
&gt; 
&gt; This is what I think the later Wittgenstein position represents.
&gt; It is why I think that Topic Maps has a deep conceptual model
&gt; that is not JUST ANOTHER IT TOOL, but is something new.

Well, I will need to wait on beginning clarification
of the keywords before I know whether I agree or not.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
