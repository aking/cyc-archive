Matthew,

While I await your clarifications on the other thread,
I think that I see a few places where this one can be
extended, perhaps to some useful purpose.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I always take people at their word,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I take you really to want to know:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The POV that you have been exposing here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information contained in their apt expressions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The "Pat Hayes Universal Change Of Variables Formula" (PHUCOVF)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that nobody ever meant to say what some people once pretended
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it said, as have you also in regard to a co-indited point.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      Pat's proof, but I am not sufficiently versed in these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      things to be sure that you are not employing the same kinds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      of tricks that you claim Pat has employed.  So I'm afraid that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      is not an arguement that will convince me on its own.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      wish to do that you will have to present a specific example
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      of where the information in some triadic relation cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      be transformed into some set of binary relations.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      provide the triadic relation, I will provide the binary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      relations from which the triadic relation can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      constructed (or not and admit you are right).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are all learning as we go, some of us one set of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things, others another, but I think that Pat and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have finally settled down to the purely logical --
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in contradistinction to the "puerly rhetorical" (sic) --
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; facet of the task, and I am secure in the knowledge
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that both of us are dogged enough not to let it go
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until we flesh out some general satisfaction on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this particular bone of contention.  'On jugera',
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as Evariste Galois said.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any rational sense will come of arguing about any puported form of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
&gt; &gt; &gt;      In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
&gt; &gt; &gt;      number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
&gt; &gt; &gt;      network of relations there is a path that links them together.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
&gt; &gt; that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
&gt; &gt; this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
&gt; &gt; such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
&gt; &gt; It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
&gt; &gt; 3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
&gt; &gt; same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
&gt; &gt; the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
&gt; &gt; are many such special cases of relations, but their existence
&gt; &gt; does not affect the general truth that many 3-adic relations
&gt; &gt; are not of this kind.  And, once again, the logical forms of
&gt; &gt; these very reductions involve 3-adic relations at every step
&gt; &gt; of the corresponding analyses.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For example, contemplate the 3-adic relation that is expressed by
&gt; &gt; the rheme "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- and then ---",
&gt; &gt; of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt;, and which
&gt; &gt; one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; |                        Jack
&gt; &gt; |                       o
&gt; &gt; |                      /
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
&gt; &gt; |                      \
&gt; &gt; |                       o
&gt; &gt; |                        Jill
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
&gt; &gt; of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
&gt; &gt; where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
&gt; &gt; of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
&gt; &gt; is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
&gt; &gt; of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
&gt; &gt; suggest by means of the following scheme:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; |                        Jack
&gt; &gt; |                [LP1]--o
&gt; &gt; |                 /      \
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12]
&gt; &gt; |                 \      /
&gt; &gt; |                [LP2]--o
&gt; &gt; |                        Jill
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In this picture, the 2-adic relations LP1, LP2, and L12
&gt; &gt; are defined to capture forms of pairwise relations like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
&gt; &gt;                  in the ordered pair q.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2nd component
&gt; &gt;                  in the ordered pair q.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
&gt; &gt;                  y is the 2nd component
&gt; &gt;                  in some ordered pair.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
&gt; &gt; defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
&gt; &gt; it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP2 (q, y).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
&gt; &gt; that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
&gt; &gt; all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
&gt; &gt; if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
&gt; &gt; There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
&gt; &gt; 2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
&gt; &gt; composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
&gt; &gt; have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.

I would like to interject a note of reservation at this juncture,
since the definition of LP12 that I gave above is not yet in the
form that I would consider the tip-top shape for perfect clarity.
The main thing that it lacks in its current shape is any sort of
careful circumscriptions of the so-called "domains of definition"
for the assorted relations that serve defined and defining roles.
Just as a thing to think about, you might well see reason to ask:
"What is the domain of definition for the variable q?"  But I do
not want to get bogged down in all of that now, so let's move on.
Still, it helps to name these domains:  so "Q", "X", "Y" will do.

Also, while I'm at it, allow me to convert my temporary terminology
into what is more like the "standard-usage-onyms" where I come from.
As a start, notice that the 2-adic relations LP1 and LP2 are actually
functions from the domain of q to the domains of x and y, respectively.
In recognition of this fact, it is usual to give them functional names,
commonly something like the following reformulations of the definitions:

1.  Proj&lt;1&gt; : XxY -&gt; X such that Proj&lt;1&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; x.

2.  Proj&lt;2&gt; : XxY -&gt; Y such that Proj&lt;2&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; y.

&gt; &gt; And yet, once again, this entire skirmish to mop-up the residual bits
&gt; &gt; of 2-adic structure that may be squeegeed out of the original 3-adic
&gt; &gt; relation is being waged only after the general issue has been conceded,
&gt; &gt; for we had to use the 3-adic relation associated with the truth-functional
&gt; &gt; connective "and" just to express the definition of LP12.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L^0 and L^1
&gt; &gt; is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
&gt; &gt; At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
&gt; &gt; and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
&gt; &gt; along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.

While I await those developments, forgive me if I just keep on talking,
and, who knows, it may even chance to happen that I will say something
to give you an idea about the relational situation, one way or another.

What we have just now established, a little ways above,
is that an ordered pair q is determined by this "data":
a couple of 2-adic relations, in particular, functions,
whose names are not of any great importance, but which
I am now calling the "projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; amd Proj&lt;2&gt;,
together with the values of q's projections in X and Y.

Here is a sort of picture that can be useful in helping us
to remember what is essential in this kind of a relational
situation, beneath the vast bewildering array of notations:

|           Q
|           =
|          XxY
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o       q   o
|   x7 o     / \ o y7
|    x6 o   /   * y6
|     x5 o /   o y5
|      x4 *   o y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y

This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
that q = &lt;x4, y6&gt;, or, in other words,
that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x4, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y6.

Well, you know how this air of poetic rhapsody
leaves me faint and suffering from the vapors,
so I had better go find some smelling salts,
and see if I have the strength to continue
tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, etc.

Until Thens,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now the "semantics" of the linking relations should support
&gt; &gt; &gt; the derivation of something more complex, but that is all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It should support the formal recognition of "something more complex",
&gt; &gt; namely, a 3-adic relation which is not reducible to 2-adic relations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
&gt; &gt; &gt;      for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
&gt; &gt; &gt;      that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
&gt; &gt; &gt;      then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
&gt; &gt; &gt;      statement about how I see relations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is another one of those places where I fear that we might
&gt; &gt; be using the word "relation" in some radically divergent way,
&gt; &gt; since I would not naturally speak of a relation in general as
&gt; &gt; representing anything, since relations are primarily objects
&gt; &gt; of discussion and thought to me, and not syntactic entities.
&gt; &gt; The special brand of a relation that I call a "sign relation"
&gt; &gt; does indeed have two of its three feet in realms of signs,
&gt; &gt; and there are many types of relations that I would choose
&gt; &gt; for "modeling" objects and processes in the world, and
&gt; &gt; there are very special sorts of relational structures
&gt; &gt; in mathematics that are called "group representations",
&gt; &gt; so maybe there is a bridge ahead, but I cannot be sure.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
&gt; &gt; &gt;      They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
&gt; &gt; &gt;      infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
&gt; &gt; &gt;      combinations of things, and then I see a further
&gt; &gt; &gt;      infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
&gt; &gt; &gt;      ourselves to those where all the members of the
&gt; &gt; &gt;      set have the same adacity).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of them,
&gt; &gt; &gt;      but to a very small subset we choose (note the word choose)
&gt; &gt; &gt;      to map our experiences of the world to in terms of connections
&gt; &gt; &gt;      (broad sense) that we see between things.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the world
&gt; &gt; &gt;      and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how to do it).
&gt; &gt; &gt;      I'm not sure you share that view.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: I would suggest that we talked more about what was being represented
&gt; &gt; &gt;     rather than how it was being represented.  I suspect that we would
&gt; &gt; &gt;     then find more to agree about.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am afraid that we can only talk about things in so far as we represent them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an object example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taken for the moment in the converse direction of synthesis, joining
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already an element of a 3-adic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relation, just as every other "binary operation" is a 3-adic relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.  Binary operations
&gt; &gt; &gt;      are of the form F : a -&gt; b, and even though a and b might be quite
&gt; &gt; &gt;      complex, the essential form is binary.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would say that the accidental form, even the superficial form is binary --
&gt; &gt; anything at all can be glossed over with a superficially simple appearance --
&gt; &gt; it is our job precisely to detect and to reveal the underlying complexities.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, there are good reasons for proceeding further, that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once the omnipresence of 3-adic relations in every analytic
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; project is conceded, but perhaps it would be best for me to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; halt at this point and see if we have any form of agreement
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about this much, at least.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
&gt; &gt; &gt;      We are talking about representation of things, rather
&gt; &gt; &gt;      than what things are.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated knowledge of being,
&gt; &gt; is not a day that I think any of our sort will see this side of heaven.
&gt; &gt; The only way that we "fallible and mortal finite information creatures"
&gt; &gt; have to approach the One and the Universal is via the Many Appearances,
&gt; &gt; by taking up as many different styles and types of representations as
&gt; &gt; we can fathom, and then, by way of transformations on them, to distill
&gt; &gt; what invariants, half concealing and half disclosing, they may manifest.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If we set the representation by relations of particular adacity
&gt; &gt; &gt; aside, I think we would find much more to agree about.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, that is a heavenly notion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; circumstance that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from an element of one.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      of what a relation is to me.  This would easily explain how we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      have been missing each other.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will take up the task of that refinement at my next opportunity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
