The TSM-information model                    version 04-Mar-2001.


The TSM-information model is a model based on time, space and
matter for an information classification structure.
Information model experts are invited to deliver comments on the
classification structure proposed here.

The most basic information classification structure can be
compiled into one simple symmetric uniform model, called the
TSM-information model.
With this model it is possible, for example, to demonstrate how
a ball game can stand model for the food cycle, a scientific
study, the interaction with a computer or logistics.
The TSM-information model should be seen as a hypothetical
symmetrical classification structure for application to data
transference.
Although I have constructed the TSM-information model on my own
initiative and although it may be lacking a scientific
character, it is certainly no figment of the imagination.

To date, I have encountered no other information models showing
the same highly plausible structure; however, this could be due
to a lack of information.
During the last few years I have continued to request comments
from experts on the model based on the questions below.
1) Is the TSM-information model plausible?
2) What is the difference between the TSM-information model
   and comparable models?
3) Can the TSM-information model be improved?

Please send your comments per e-mail to, H.F. Prins, email:
HF.Prins@rivm.nl

TSM-information model will be discussed under the following
headings: empirical cycle, model description, similarities
between classifications and applications.


1) EMPIRICAL CYCLE


How can we find out what we want to know?

What we want to learn about something seems very allied with the
way our personal data management system functions.
Data represents the matter that "enters" an object (thing or
living creature) by (re)movement / (re)placement / transference.
All living creatures who are endowed with a brain spend a life
time managing data in the form of thoughts.
Should we assume that data management by the brain is as good as
other biological body functions?
Probably yes, otherwise we would not exist.
How do we handle complex data?
How do we manage to get rid of unimportant data easily and
quickly and maintain important data?
The data we handle would seem to submit to a kind of
classification.
Knowing how this classification functions is knowing how we think
and therefore knowing what we want to learn about something.
So the search is on for an information model which may have an
existing natural classification structure.


Why do we want knowledge on such a model?

A model with a natural classification structure for information
allows us to understand our thoughts and means of expressions
more easily.
A reliable information model for classification can be helpful
in finding, storing and processing information, not only in our
brains but in searching other information sources.
With the help of a well-designed uniform model with a
classification structure, we can more easily and more exactly
distinguish the participant objects in time, space and matter
and strongly anchor our thoughts to reality.


What is information?

Information is the whole of relationships of an object and
therefor the meaning of an object.
We cannot know the essence of an object, but we can know the
relationships of an object.
All relationships explain cause and consequence of an object.
A special type of relationship is interaction.
Interaction means physical contact between objects by
displacement of an object (data) from one object into another
object.
Interaction between objects can only take place in transference
from object to object.
An object has meaning through the exchange of data with its
environment.
In the living and non-living world we see data transfer between
objects is obvious both in the animate (living) and inanimate
(non-living) world.
For example, data is represented by a ball, a person travelling
or an object purely meant to act as a signal, e.g. structured
words have cause and effect.

Suppose we want to understand the meaning of an arbitrary
phenomenon.
For convenience sake we describe a phenomenon as a experienced
whole, confined by a certain period and a certain space.
We can name a phenomenon with which we refer to a familiar
reference framework in one's memory or a piece of text.
The choice of a name is related to a number of permanent
features with which the phenomenon is defined.
Permanent features are meant here as permanent characteristics
within limited values.


How do we describe a natural classification structure for
information?

We may assume that natural selection has given us a successful
natural information system and well developed enough for
surviving in our environment.
Therefore a natural classification structure for information is
likely to be an autodidactic system which makes use of naturally
assumed standard units.
Comparisons are made with the help of what we have learned in
the past and how we have learned it as a result of natural
selection and individual experience.
Briefly, we are continuously assigning values to experiences,
i.e. evaluating by making comparisons with what we already
(think) we know.
The way in which we make comparisons can be expressed in a few
fairly simple and logical relationships.


How do we find a natural classification structure for
information?

From a historical point of view:
1) We can guess how we think without knowing what others have
   told us.
   Consequently, we cannot think in the units used in physics,
   but we can compare the phenomena with direct observable
   phenomena in the current direct environment.
2) We can also can find indications in religious scripts.
   The word "religion" originally meant continuous/repeated
   consideration/contemplation.
   Does this sound familiar?
   In learning, we continue to begin with our experience of and
   skill used in earlier attempts.
3) We can also investigate how the first humans could have
   thought.
   The oldest histories and languages, e.g. the Indo-Germanic
   language, can point to indications.


What could we have found about a natural classification structure
for information?

1) During thinking we try to structure the information of our
   observations.
   These information structures are models for objects.
   We use two terms to distinguish these objects:
   - Thing and
   - Event.
   The above distinction is not well defined and indicates mainly
   our struggle to comprehend the world.
   Our restricted understanding of the world is closely related
   with the way we can observe, think and act.
   Some objects seem evident and others seem less or not evident.
   We name and define some objects, while we preferring only to
   describe other objects with matter, space and time
   relationships.
   A special type of relationship is interaction.
   Interaction means physical contact between objects by
   displacement of an object from one object into another object.
   Interaction between objects can only take place in
   transference from object to object.

2) A common feature in religion is the effort to elucidate and
   illustrate:
   - Concrete phenomena and
   - Abstract phenomena.
   We are no great investors in abstract phenomena from nature.
   Abstract phenomena can be described as phenomena with
   complicated relationships.
   Lives of humans and humankind reek of false approval and false
   disapproval.
   Proper information can contribute to a behaviour which is
   better understood.
   Understood behaviour needs no judgement, but rational thinking
   and solutions.

3) A striking phenomena in the Indo-Germanic language is the
   distinction between:
   - Permanent (strong) objects and
   - Temporary (weak)   objects.
   The existence of objects seems to reflect an alternation
   between cause and consequence in which we consider:
   - The cause       as the model for the consequence and
   - The consequence as the model for the cause.
   As thinking creatures we clearly experience our influence on
   the world.
   We experience a strong alternation between our thoughts and
   the world around us.
   Our thoughts can function as strong models for the more
   concrete reality and vice versa.
   For many centuries a popular way to give our thoughts more
   concrete meaning, force and a longer existence has been by
   writing our thoughts down.
   Even very complicated, old and written texts from afar can
   be read.
   Text can be very powerful but nowadays radio, television and
   internet can reach the same public in time and space, with
   even more vivid images.

So far we have encountered for instance:
1) Distinction for us between:
   -                      Clearly enough defined objects and
   - Interactions between clearly enough defined objects.
2) Interactions are transfers of data between objects.
3) An object can be a thing or a living creature.
   As thinking creatures we can have great influences in the
   creation of our world, but in essence the interactions between
   objects simply consists of objects moving between objects.


What are the similarities between interactions?

Interactions have a permanent structure as distinct from the
four successive stages of different phenomena named below.
For convenience sake we describe the moving objects as data.
The successive stages (=phases) of data flows form a cycle.
In the cases below the letter S stands for the object concerned;
the letter E stands for the environment of S.
Sequence of the data transference is uniform.
Sometimes we can indicate a certain object in the environment as
the principal contributor to the interaction.

In general:

S = Subject
E = Environment

1. Data transference from S to E                 = S-&gt;E
2. Data transference inside    E                 = E-&gt;E
3. Data transference from E to S                 = E-&gt;S
4. Data transference inside    S                 = S-&gt;S

Below are a few examples.
Go along with the examples far as you can, there is no need for
total agreement since we are still dealing with a discussion
and not a selection.

This first example looks rather simple:

a) A volleyball game
   Upfield S + upfield E
   The ball is tossed up in a rally:
   1. From upfield S to upfield E                = S-&gt;E
   2. Above             upfield E                = E-&gt;E
   3. From upfield E to upfield S                = E-&gt;S
   4. Above             upfield S                = S-&gt;S

One clearly defined object, called the ball, is tossed up, in
and out of two clearly defined objects.

In the next example the "flying" object has a more abstract form,
and the unit of data is called a "question" or an "answer".

b) Use of a DBMS (=database management system)
   User S + DBMS within E
   1. Transport   of question to   DBMS          = S-&gt;E
   2. Program-run of question in   DBMS          = E-&gt;E
   3. Transport   of answer   from DBMS          = E-&gt;S
   4. Use         of answer   from DBMS          = S-&gt;S

We sometimes first have to build the things we use.

c) Building/making a DBMS
   Builder S + DBMS within E
   1. Addition    of data to   DBMS              = S-&gt;E
   2. Mutation    of data in   DBMS              = E-&gt;E
   3. Elimination of data from DBMS              = E-&gt;S
   4. Collection  of data for  DBMS              = S-&gt;S

Note that the data in the two previous examples, are certainly
not unique, but only copies of data.

The moving objects are not always simple to indicate.
For convenience sake we call them nutrients here.

d) The food cycle
   Plant S + Environment E
   1. Nutrition of plant to   environment        = S-&gt;E
   2. Growth             of   environment        = E-&gt;E
   3. Nutrition of plant from environment        = E-&gt;S
   4. Growth    of plant                         = S-&gt;S

So far we have seen aspects of building and use.
Moving objects can also lead to damage and breakdown.

e) Transport of goods
   Subject S + Environment E
   1. Delivery from S &amp; capture    in     E      = S-&gt;E
   2. Construction    &amp; demolition inside E      = E-&gt;E
   3. Delivery from E &amp; capture    in     S      = E-&gt;S
   4. Construction    &amp; demolition inside S      = S-&gt;S

We can also consider the clearer information aspects of moving
objects between two living creatures.

f) Observation
   Person S + a person in Environment E
   1. Expression of   S &amp; observation    of E    = S-&gt;E
   2. Analysis        &amp; synthesis inside of E    = E-&gt;E
   3. Expression of E &amp; observation      of S    = E-&gt;S
   4. Analysis        &amp; synthesis inside of S    = S-&gt;S

The information exchange can also be more specific.

g) A doctor's visit
   Patient S + doctor within E
   1. Patient informs    doctor:     anamnesis   = S-&gt;E
   2. Doctor  determines affliction: diagnosis   = E-&gt;E
   3. Doctor  informs    patient:    prognosis   = E-&gt;S
   4. Patient applies    treatment:  medication  = S-&gt;S

The objects in the environment with which the interaction takes
place may look diffuse.
Suppose a person tries to learn something about an object in the
environment, a so-called learning-object.
The environment may consist of:
- A person telling about the learning-object.
- Models of the learning-object, e.g. in the form of texts.
- Sometimes the real object itself.
- The influence of the person's body, in which thoughts too are
  housed.
There are lot of possibilities in the environment and no clear
object can be confined as to "who" or "what" the essence of the
person, the brain, the thought is, and what not?

In the next few examples we can consider the data related to
the learning-object.
The four stages cannot be clearly separated one from another
in time, but represent a manner of action during learning.
The four stages also indicate the sequence of importance for
each method of action.

h) The attendance of a lecture
   Listener S + lecture within E
   1. Attention.       S stimulates E            = S-&gt;E
   2. Introduction.    Inside assimilation of E  = E-&gt;E
   3. Explanation.     E stimulates S            = E-&gt;S
   4. Conclusion.      Inside assimilation of S  = S-&gt;S

i) The reading of a report
   Reader S + report within E
   1. Preface.         S stimulates E            = S-&gt;E
   2. Introduction.    Inside assimilation of E  = E-&gt;E
   3. Argumentation.   E stimulates S            = E-&gt;S
   4. Final word.      Inside assimilation of S  = S-&gt;S

So far there is no confusion about the person, who is only the
listener with respect to a reader or the reader with respect to a
report and takes no farther action in dragging down or even
"rebuilding" the learning-object.
But we stated earlier that neither could a clear object be
confined to whom or what the essence of a person, the brain or
the thought is, and what it is not?
Here we meet a new challenge for our abstract perception
capacity.
Now, please try to imagine S as the centre for the perception of
the learning-object, so that the rest of the person can be seen
as part of the environment to help discover the identity and/or
the characteristics of the learning-object.
Therefore a student or investigator serves partly as S and E,
which is not so strange when you think of a person who
investigates one's own body or body functions.

j) Study
   Student S + study topic within E
   1. Motivation.      S stimulates E            = S-&gt;E
   2. Schematics.      Inside assimilation of E  = E-&gt;E
   3. Elaboration.     E stimulates S            = E-&gt;S
   4. Evaluation.      Inside assimilation of S  = S-&gt;S

k) Investigation method
   Investigator S + investigation-object within E
   1. Instruction.     S stimulates E            = S-&gt;E
   2. Investigation.   Inside assimilation of E  = E-&gt;E
   3. Presentation.    E stimulates S            = E-&gt;S
   4. Evaluation.      Inside assimilation of S  = S-&gt;S

And now for the final countdown in abstraction, let us take a
dive into the so-called Transactional Analysis (T.A.) in
psychology.

m) Transactional Analysis
   Person S + environment E
   1. ELDERLY     = conservative  behaviour      = S-&gt;E
   2. ENVIRONMENT = environment   behaviour      = E-&gt;E
   3. CHILD       = emotional     behaviour      = E-&gt;S
   4. ADULT       = rational      behaviour      = S-&gt;S

Note here that we consider different types of behaviour, each
with emphasis on one stage in the cycle and each with its own
functionality in different situations.
In Transaction psychiatry we are introduced to three types of
behaviour:
- ELDERLY: with a disproportionate output.
- CHILD:   with a disproportionate input.
- ADULT:   with a    proportionate input, processing and output.

Order of stages:
1) When a person "acts" in the environment, with hardly any
   regard for input of a person's emotions and barely without
   thinking, but principally conforming to actions learned, the
   person's behaviour is indicated as "ELDERLY".
2) When a person does not act in the environment, and so has no
   interaction with the environment, the environment acts on
   its own.
   This stage does not represent a type of behaviour in T.A.
   because the person is not involved.
3) When a person "acts" in an environment that is mainly
   controlled by input of a person's emotions and almost without
   thinking, the person's behaviour is indicated as "CHILD".
4) When a person "acts" in the environment, proportionally
   controlled by thinking about the input of person's emotions
   and actions learned, the person's behaviour is indicated as
   "ADULT".
The above term "acts" can in each stage mean:
 - Receiving  data from   the environment.
 - Processing data within the person.
 - Sending    data to     the environment.

The difference between the types of behaviour concerns the
proportion of input, processing and output, each with their own
benefits in different situations.
Note the special meaning of input and output here:
- Input  concerns a person's emotions.
- Output concerns a person's capacities/skills.
Note that emotions can be related to (wishes/concerns of):
- Present
- Past and
- Future.


The similarities in the above examples are described below:

1) With the exchange of data we can distinguish:
   - Subject     S , in living creatures as the unit of
     contemplation.
   - Environment E , environment of subject S in which S realises
     an exchange of data.
   In all 4 stages S and E remain the same.

2) Data exchange can be characterised by four types of data flows
   in sequence of stage:
   1. Data flow from  inside subject S       to environment E.
   2. Data flow      outside subject S,  inside environment E.
   3. Data flow to    inside subject S     from environment E.
   4. Data flow       inside subject S, outside environment E.

3) In each stage we find the presence of:
   - A special source-object A
   - A special  reach-object B
   Source-object A and reach-object B are connected by the
   transferred object C.
   The transferred object, C, is matter with information aspects.

   The transference of data (C) may be schematically proposed as:

   Object A  ---- Object C ----&gt; Object B

   The influence outside A B C can be indicated with object D.
   A and B can be contemplated as elements of subject S or
   environment E.

   Reach-object B in one stage is the same as source-object A in
   the next stage.


The next example is an illustration of the "investigation cycle",
also called the "scientific method".
The same interaction can be applied between investigator and
investigation object (study-object) for people of all ages.
The cycle consists of four successive stages, where stage 4 goes
into stage 1.

Stages:

1) In the first stage we observe an action going from the
   motivated investigator to the study-object in the environment.
   The investigator directs the attention to the study-object and
   tries to get a hold on it by seizing, catching, grasping,
   clutching and snatching.

   Motivation to investigate can be induced by a command, a
   request or a passion brought about by (a model of) the
   study-object during the earlier stages: stage 4 and earlier.

   Above we have named stage 1, Motivation.
   The motivation of S can be indicated as the will/desire/wish
   of S.
   The will of S is present in each stage, but is shown in
   different ways.
   The choice to name stage 1, Motivation, is arbitrary, just as
   the naming of all other stages.

   There are different ways of seizing a study-object, e.g. by
   drawing the attention of the study-object or by physical
   contact or by letting it do it for you, e.g. through a teacher
   or other helper.

2) In the second stage the study-object has an internal working,
   and at the same time is dependent on the way the study-object
   is approximated.
   For example, a student-teacher can install a model, e.g.
   scheme, of the study-object.
   The investigator can also play a substantial part in dealing
   with the study-object, as we have encountered above, where
   was stated that the investigator can be partly S or E.

3) In the third stage (models of) the study-object act(s)
   towards the investigator.
   The investigator directs the attention to the study-object
   with a concentrated eye, ear, nose, taste or mind.
   For example, a student-teacher can present a model, e.g.
   scheme, of the study-object.

4) In the fourth stage the investigator acts internally.
   The investigator evaluates the findings on the study-object.
   A teacher can audibly help with the evaluation.


2) MODEL DESCRIPTION

The TSM-information model is a structure for classification of
information, in which TSM stands for TIME SPACE MATTER.

The concept MATTER in the TSM-information model is NOT the
"matter" concept in physics where matter is characterised by
mass.
In the TSM-information model the unit of MATTER is
contemplated as a phenomenon in the form of an object, which
can be a thing or a living creature.
So the unit of MATTER is an object.

While observing the object, we may notice that the object:
- Remains the same or
- Changes.

A change can always be reduced to a change of place.
A change of place can be:
- A change of place of (a part of) the contemplated object,
  which is called TIME  = T.
  This means a transported object C in relation to object S.
- A change of place of the contemplator,
  which is called SPACE = R.
  This means an object in relation to transported object C.

TIME   = Change of MATTER at 1 location -&gt; different moments.
SPACE  = Change of MATTER at 1 moment   -&gt; different locations.

Change of MATTER does not necessary lead to an-other name of an
object.
The name of an object depends on a whole body of characteristics.
The name of an object is characterised by a number of permanent
character-values, where a permanent character-value is a value
within the value limits that determines the object.

The TSM-information model is a classification model for
information on the main classification of the three base
quantities: TIME, SPACE and MATTER.
A base quantity is looked upon as a relation-type.
Each base quantity has four different relationships concerning
the direct environment of a contemplated object.

T) TIME: 4 stages
1 = transference of C from inside S to   outside S.
2 = transference of C                    outside S.
3 = transference of C into inside S from outside S
4 = transference of C      inside S.

R) SPACE: 4 objects
A =   Source-object of   the transported-object.
B =    Reach-object of   the transported-object.
C =                      The transported-object.
D = Involved-object with the transported object,
    but not A B or C.

M) MATTER: 4 objects
:=   = The observed   object.
:!   = The opposite   object of the observed object.
:&lt;   = The fractional object of the observed object.
:&gt;   = The enclosing  object of the observed object.

Scheme of TIME and SPACE:

T = Relation of object C              to object S
S = Relation of object A  B  C  or D  to object C
M = Relation of object := :! :&lt; or :&gt; to object :=


Notes on TIME
- It may be convenient or relevant to describe all four stages,
  but it may also be convenient or relevant to describe fewer
  stages, just describing or naming the inside or outside stages
  in which C may be converted to another C.
  For instance, in a data flow scheme it is not always relevant
  to describe the internal transference, but only the change of
  C.
- If the transported object C is changed somewhere, C can be
  regarded as object S in another context, with its own four
  stages.

Notes on SPACE
- Objects A and B can be regarded as objects of S and/or E.

Notes on MATTER
- It is also possible to observe the total collection/compilation
  of objects as one object. The classification structure remains
  the same.
- The classification of MATTER can be regarded as a
  classification according to one ore more
  characteristics/properties/features of an object.
- The : token in MATTER is applied to distinguish the meaning of
  := :! :&gt; :&lt; from = ! &gt; &lt; tokens.
- Looking at the classification of MATTER there seems to be no
  place for "overlap".
  However, "overlap" is found in the relationships between
  different objects that belong to the relationship :&lt; , namely
  the elements (congener) of an object.
- Example: a volleyball game between two teams.
           According to M:
           :=          Team with name Brazil.
           :! Opponent team with name Bolivia.
           :&lt; Every player of the Brazil team.
           :&gt; All participating teams in the tournament.
- TIME   can be classified with four stages         , each with a
         SPACE construction.
- SPACE  can be classified with four spatial objects, each with a
         MATTER construction.
- MATTER can be classified with four matter  objects.
- Each object can have a TIME construction.
- Cycles have links by sharing the same object.


3) SIMILARITIES IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS


TIME   can be contemplated as change of MATTER within the same
space.
SPACE  can be contemplated as change of MATTER within the same
time.

In other words:
TIME   is recognised when an observation space is not moved and
the observer becomes aware of other MATTER.
SPACE  is recognised when an observation time stands still  and
the observer becomes aware of other MATTER.

Notice the similarities between the classifications of TIME SPACE
and MATTER.
The differences  concern the objects in each relationship and
the similarities concern the four relationships.

Differences in objects:

T = Relation of object C           to object S
S = Relation of object A  B  C  D  to object C
M = Relation of object := :! :&lt; :&gt; to object := and v.v.

Similarities in relations:

Each relation is concerned with 2 objects in 2 positions:
- position 1 = before the change of MATTER.
- position 2 = after  the change of MATTER.

The relation of one object to the other object is indicated with
the letters:
I =  INSIDE
O = OUTSIDE

Explanation of the symbols and abbreviations in the next table:

   ^     = internal transference
   &gt;     = transference of the first object to the next
   I-O =  INSIDE with respect to OUTSIDE
   O-O = OUTSIDE with respect to OUTSIDE
   O-I = OUTSIDE with respect to  INSIDE
   I-I =  INSIDE with respect to  INSIDE

4) APPLICATIONS


All cycles can be described according to the TSM-information
model.
This model can serve as an aid in indicating the characteristics
always present while observing an object.
The TSM-information model is infinitive, extendable in time,
space, and matter.
The TSM model comprehends all forms of definition.

The TSM-information model can be used for:
- Computer programs
- Computer program-menus
- Databases
- Recipes
- Prescriptions
- Lectures
- Schemes
- Reports
- Definitions
- Data flow schemes
