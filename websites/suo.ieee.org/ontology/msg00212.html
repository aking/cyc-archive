&gt; Re:  "Is Icon A Proposition?"

&gt; | When Peirce speaks of a "Proposition", how can we tell
&gt; | when he is speaking of a particular kind of a Sign and
&gt; | when he is speaking of a particular kind of an Object?

Dear Jon &amp; Friends,

          I read from Pearse  (a Sketch of Logical Critics) that

          [Signs] represent their objects:

ICONS        -                             "only in so fa as they resemble
them in themselves",

INDICES     -                             "indipendently of any resemblance
to them, only by virtue of real connection with them"[.......as a]
"yardstick represent the standard yard",

SYMBOLS   -                             "indipendently alike of any
resemblance, any real connection [to them]      because dispositions    or
factitious habits of their interpreters insure their being so understood.

and that,

for feelings,  "Icon are the sole possible ultimate signs", while [...] "the
presence or absence of falsity can only be ultimately and directy assured by
an Index and [....] brought to mind by an ICON of an index [INDICES]".


So let's do some  home work.

SYMBOLS such as
: ; ) ( - |
may be assembled and used as an ICON of an object (a person) and is used (in
fact) to express feelings
:-)
:-|
:-(
;-))

or (some of them) used as an INDEX

if this is a unit - and an Index  this is also an
Icon of an Index at the same time.
----------|
----------|-----------!
[ two unit]

Perhaps this is a proposition (used in practise to say I like you)

I :-) You

and because in this context (a mail where "I" and "you" are implicit)
this too may be a proposition

:-)

That is to say an Icon, made of symbols may  be a proposition, in a suitable
context.

(With infinite variations: E=mc^2 appears often to be used as an ICON for
The Science concept).

So to answer the question, I do not know very much Pearce writings  but I'm
inclined to think  that, whatever might be a "proposition", we can tell
what Peirce is speaking about  looking at the whole context (or ambit). And
that include ourself too.

Considering the reading of an ancient book  as a deferred "low band - low
context" commmunication process I'm afraid that there is more then one
possibility that we will never know  for sure what it meant (we may just ask
to the Expert).

By the way this is true in my opinion for any communication context (where
there are always one or more "contingent" experts).

Communication in fact accours in any given time in a
natural-artificial-social ambit.

Understanding, communication  and learning, as we all know, are not only a
question of logic, but involve maths,psychical  as well as physical science,
practise and information infrastructure so on...

In fact  knowledge is socially distributed (as well as data), and is
(partially) sharable only if there is a (partial) common background
(a common ambit).

In this sense the  Standard Superior Ontolgy mission might be to define a
minumum common ambit between the various communities interested in the
project, suitable to accelerate the knowledge accumulation process, and it
appear to me that somehow it is working.

The possibility to create this common using information infrastructure in my
opinion should be investigated in practice, too.

All the best.

Roberto Bordogna
