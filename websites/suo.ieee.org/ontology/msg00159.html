     Pat Hayes has provided some heuristically useful arguments
to illustrate his viewpoint that, in order to create a Standard
Upper Ontology, it will be necessary to make some contentious
choices about fundamental issues of knowledge representation.  As
to "some", it has been an assumption of the SUO that choices will
need to be made, and that is the reason I have argued for the
importance of carefully defined procedures for making decisions
within this project.  Just how many such choices will be forced,
however, remains to be determined, and discovering how many may
be one of the important results that this volunteer effort can
achieve.  Pat Hayes can, if he is willing, help to clarify which
choices lead to which results.   Some of the points Pat has covered 
are within the areas where he is one of the world's premier experts, 
and we can surely be grateful to him that he has taken the time and 
made the considerable effort to provide some details of his thoughts 
on those issues as they relate to the task we are attempting.
     Pat's notes to this list cover several important issues
which will need to be discussed at some time as part of the
process of building an SUO, and this is a good time to start.
Regrettably, I can only carve out small portions of my time (the
curse of a volunteer effort), and in this note will only address
two of the points Pat has made, and provide a clarification.  I
hope to cover other points in future notes.

  This note will discuss three questions:
1.  How can two ontologies be  "different" without being
contradictory?
2.  How sound and intuitively convincing is the Public CYC Upper
ontology, and in particular does it really say that a physical
object is the same as the space it occupies?
3.  Which theories of Time are compatible with a physically
realistic description of processes and events?



---------------------------------------------
1. Clarification: "different" ontologies
   To clarify a point about the goal of interoperability: Pat's
earlier note asked how ontologies using an SUO can be
"different":

[Pat Cassidy]
&gt;&gt;    My understanding of the purpose (or one purpose) of the SUO
&gt;&gt; effort was to create a defining vocabulary of basic terms that
&gt;&gt; will allow a user to define a concept in terms of the SUO and
&gt;&gt; thereby permit someone with a different ontology to use the 
&gt;&gt; same concept, with the same axioms and inferences, when two 
&gt;&gt; ontologies want to transfer information.
&gt;&gt;
[Pat Hayes]
&gt; Already this seems odd. If they are using the same axioms and
&gt; inferences, then in what sense are the ontologies different? An
&gt; ontology only is a set of axioms. The key point is that
&gt; different ontologies will not use the same axioms, not even 
&gt; the same nonlogical vocabulary, and that the various vocabularies 
&gt; in use will be(and already are) profoundly irreconcilable with 
&gt; each other.
&gt;
   Two ontologies can be "different" in the intended sense if
they both use the SUO, and differ by having different added
definitions, not necessarily covering the same area of knowledge.
One ontology for example may have added definitions and axioms
about health care, and another about some chemical manufacturing
process.  If these two ontologies are to be used to exchange
conceptual information in one of those two specialized areas, the
defining axioms need to be exchanged, and unless there is some
conflict in one or more of the added definitions, both
ontologies, *after* exchange of axioms, would in effect be the
same, and inferences that both systems make about the same topics
should be identical.  This should be true even if not all added
axioms in both ontologies were exchanged, but only those
affecting the areas in which information is to be exchanged -- in
this case the resulting ontologies will only be "the same" with
respect to the common set of concepts, and otherwise "different".
    This is probably the best case, but is not impractical if, in
addition to the SUO itself, we maintain, as I hope we will, at
least one extension "reference ontology" which contains many more
specialized concepts contributed by their creators and logically
compatible with each other.  If there is only one such reference
ontology, it is certain that many choices of representation will
need to be made, probably even more than with the basic SUO, and
possibly just as contentious.  Having one extension reference
ontology would allow those programmers who are not passionate
about certain ontological issues to find an off-the-shelf
ontology with most of what they need, to be supplemented by any
additional knowledge that their application requires.  Whether
more than one specialized ontology should be maintained as
reference ontologies has not been much discussed yet, it is an
issue very far down the road.

   Regarding Pat Hayes's last sentence above:

&gt; the various vocabularies in use will be (and
&gt; already are) profoundly irreconcilable with each other.
   I thought that was precisely the existing problem that the SUO
project is intended to help resolve:  Not by *retroactively*
reconciling differences in existing ontologies, which may well be
logically irreconcilable, but by providing a logically sound
vocabulary that will allow (but not force) future ontology
builders to build ontologies based on a common set of fundamental
axioms, allowing them to accurately interchange conceptual
information, if they choose to follow the standard.  Providing a
common vocabulary *may* also help to achieve some limited level
of conceptual interchange ("a degree of interoperability", in the
wording of the Scope and Purpose) between existing ontologies,
but for any two existing ontologies that will be extremely
sensitive to the fundamental assumptions they have made and how
close they already are, and whether their maintainers are willing
to make changes to achieve some compatibility.
    If Pat Hayes merely wants to emphasize that it will be
necessary to make some choices, that also has always been an
underlying assumption -- indeed one of the purposes -- of the
SUO.  If his arguments are that existing ontologies are probably
all logically inconsistent, well I don't know of anyone who
disagrees.
-------------------------------

2.  The adequacy of the Public CYC Upper ontology

     Since several contributors to this list consider the public
CYC upper ontology as one of the most important existing sources
of concepts for inclusion in the SUO, it is important to know
where the CYC representations appear logically and intuitively
sound and where they do not.
     In an earlier note, Pat Hayes had noted, in casting doubt on 
the adequacy of CYC, that CYC equates a physical object with the
region of space it occupies.  I recall (sorry -- no reference
comes to mind)  years ago having seen an article in which Lenat
mentions that these two concepts are (as I recall)
*indistinguishable*, and that this is one of the unanticipated
results of the CYC project.  But my recollection is that this was
a conclusion, not an explicit assertion contained in the public
CYC upper ontology.  My question to Pat was whether this equation
of an object and its space was actually an assertion or a
*necessary* conclusion from the concepts in the public CYC upper
ontology, or merely an artifact of some limited set of reasoning
mechanisms actually implemented in CYC.  In response, Pat
suggested that I look at the CYC definitions of #$SpatialThing
and #$near.  I have reproduced those definitions from the public
Upper CYC in an addendum at the bottom of this note for those who
don't have it at hand.
     After review of those definitions, I still don't see the
equation of a physical object and region of space it occupies as
implied in them.  The CYC #$SpatialThing includes intangible
objects like the Arctic Circle.  To be sure, these definitions of
#$SpatialThing and #$near contain some non-intuitive elements,
which I would prefer to define otherwise.  According to the
definition of #$near, for example, two bacteria sitting
diametrically opposite each other on a strand of hair would not
be #$near each other.  This concept might better be relabeled
"relatively_near" and a related concept, "absolutely_near" might
be defined for objects distant from each other by less than, say,
a centimeter.  Some object intuitively "near" another might then
fit either one or both of these two criteria.


  But even after we question the intuitive validity or practical
usefulness of these or other CYC concepts, it is not obvious (to
this non-logician) that they somehow imply the equation of a
physical object with its occupied space.   CYC is complex, and I
may easily have missed the chain of reasoning by which such an
equation can be inferred from the public Upper CYC.  If Pat or
some Cyclist knows that chain of reasoning, he would do a great
service to this project to reproduce it in full.

More about CYC:
---------------------
    Pat Hayes has also mentioned in several notes that some of
the CYC concept definitions present logical or representational
problems.  For example:

&gt;  The Cyc ontology is full of gaps and oddities. Its spatial 
&gt; concepts, for example, are full of implicit
&gt; assumptions (that objects are medium-sized, that gravity is
&gt; salient, that spaces are understood at a geographical scale,
&gt; for just a few) which do not apply outside a relatively narrow 
&gt; domain of application (roughly that of 'common sense' reasoning, 
&gt; as one would
&gt; expect from Cyc's original motivation). It doesnt have a clear
&gt; temporal ontology (it has shreds of various ones, all mutually
&gt; incompatible.) If you want to talk about oil supply lines in
&gt; the middle east, Cyc does it pretty well. If you want to talk about
&gt; ideas, flavors, cooking, religion, chemistry, biology, physics,
&gt; geology, weather, hydrodynamics, law, dynamics, or almost
&gt; anything you care to name, it does a pretty poor job. Either 
&gt; you won't find the concepts you want in it, or (more seriously) 
&gt; you will find concepts which sound something like the concepts 
&gt; you want, but don't in fact fit your conceptual picture properly.
&gt; This has been almost our universal experience in using Cyc for 
&gt; the RKF effort. We found many useful-seeming concepts, but on 
&gt; examining the axioms we had to reject about 70% of them immediately, 
&gt; and on examining the actual inferences that the system made we 
&gt; found that most of the concepts didnt in fact support the inferences 
&gt; one would have thought reasonable, so we had to reject most of them, 
&gt; and write our own ontology using a subset of them and other concepts 
&gt; which are incommensurate with them.
&gt;
&gt;
   On CYC's "mutually incompatible" temporal representations: The
public CYC slots describing time relations are not defined to the level
of detail that will be needed in the SUO, and until the gaps are
filled in it is not immediately obvious to me which relations
might cause logical inconsistencies with which classes as
arguments.  If Pat can provide specific examples of incompatible
inferences, that will be very helpful.  Pat's comment above
indicates that CYC is generally inadequate for his purposes.   If
Pat Hayes knows of specific examples that he has encountered
where CYC concepts lead to logical inconsistency, or can
recommend some list of alternative and better representations for
some of the CYC concepts, it would help us select from among the
CYC public concepts those that are the most acceptable to a wide
community.  Or it might be easier for him to list the CYC
concepts that he considers still useful.
    A list of some of the CYC slots related to time intervals and
events, and the CYC documentation for #$TemporalThing and
#$TimeInterval are provided below, to give members of this list
some notion of the meanings of the CYC terms, without hunting
through the public CYC.  These can serve to assist the initial
discussions regarding whether the CYC concepts related to time
will serve the purpose of the SUO.


------------------------------------

3.  Time: which theories are logically consistent for practical
implementations?
  Another point Pat makes which is important enough to warrant
the attention of this group regards the representation of time.
Here Pat is, if not *the* most important, one of the most
important experts.
    In his paper "A Catalog of Temporal Theories"
(<A  HREF="http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/TimeCatalog1.ps">http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/TimeCatalog1.ps</A> and
<A  HREF="http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/TimeCatalog2.ps">http://www.coginst.uwf.edu/~phayes/TimeCatalog2.ps</A>) Pat has
provided an excellent review (but, he says, "not a complete
survey") of the most prominent theories of time.  Those who want
to use an ontology for practical matters of reasoning about
objects and events in the "real world" will want to know which of
the possible time theories will be compatible, i.e., give the
same logical inferences, for reasoning about physical systems.
    In Pat's paper, chapter 3 starts with the following
sentences:

===========================

                3. TEMPORAL THEORIES
                ____________________

The theories we consider differ in several respects, both in
their axiomatic style and in the intuitions they support.  Most
theories are consistent with the following ideas:

1.  A timeinterval is a connected piece of the time-plenum.
Things that have a temporal extent, or which occupy time in some
way, must have a time interval which is their life-span.

2.  Every interval has a unique temporal magnitude.

3.  An interval has two endpoints, and it is uniquely determined
by those endpoints.

4.  A point can be uniquely determined by the magnitude of the
interval between it and some special 'zero' position (such as
midnight, or January 1 of the year zero).

==============================
    And in another on-line paper, Pat Hayes says, regarding
whether time points or time intervals should be considered as
primitive:

   "As Allen and I showed some time ago, the choice is arbitrary,
since points can be transparently defined in an interval theory
and vice versa, so the choice of one as somehow more basic is,
er, pointless; and one gets a more useful account simply by
allowing them both as primitive."

    In everyday and scientific discussion, the concepts of both
time intervals and points are used, and an SUO must contain both
concepts.  It is comforting to know that at least some useful
notions regarding time points and intervals can be expressed in
any one of several theories.
    In his paper, Pat provides the predicates defining several
logically inconsistent theories of time, all definitions using
the same logical notation.  They are inconsistent, of course, if
one assumes that someone is going to use those different sets of
predicates to all refer to a *single* notion of "time".  They are
not inconsistent if one assumes that an SUO will contain all of
those definitions, but each will refer to a different concept,
labeled, for example, "point_continuum_time", "interval_time",
"clock-tick-time", etc.

In his paper and in his note in response to my note, Pat has also
mentioned the logical inconsistencies in several definitions of
"time interval".

[Pat Cassidy]
&gt;&gt; If we define both time points and time intervals,
&gt;&gt; and allow the users to decide which representation of time is
best for
&gt;&gt; their applications, will any logical contradictions occur
within the
&gt;&gt; defining vocabulary?
&gt;
&gt; [Pat Hayes]
&gt; Yes, immediately. If you are not careful, you will get dozens
of
&gt; contradictions. (Which sense of 'interval' do you mean? Allen's
&gt; temporal ontology uses a sense different from that used in
topology
&gt; and analysis, mereology uses yet another different notion, and
&gt; temporal databases yet another.) Probably about 50 person-years
have
&gt; been spent on this topic of time-intervals. If you manage to
get
&gt; space sorted out, write it up and publish it immediately.
&gt;
   Of course, in this case too the different definitions of
"interval" would have different names and represent different
concepts. The question I am concerned about is whether, when we
define realistic representations of physical systems, the
inferences using one of these time theories may differ from the
inferences using another.  Logicians and philosophers may not be
able to come to an agreement about which of these representations
is the "best", but the builders of an SUO intended for practical
use will be concerned about which one or more will provide a
basis for representing the physical world in realistic terms.

   In over 30 years as a practicing experimental scientist I am
certain that not once have I heard a colleague fret over the
possibility that the accuracy of the measurements we make every
day may be compromised by our ignorance of whether we are
measuring open or closed intervals, i.e. whether we may be in
error by one part in some uncountable infinity.  Of immediate
concern is the accuracy of our instruments, commonly one part in
a thousand, which has direct consequence for the validity of our
results.

   A realistic representation of physical facts will always
contain some variable representing uncertainty, a margin of error
which is due to the limited precision of our instruments, or in
extreme cases, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.   A
simplified representation may choose to set the uncertainty at 0,
and in such cases the kinds of logical inconsistency among time
theories that concerns Pat Hayes may cause contradictions in
inferences.  If that is the case, it may be necessary to, for
example, choose only one representation of time that can be used
in conjunction with uncertainties of zero magnitude, when
defining time-dependent phenomena.  I think that a representation
containing time points and closed intervals on the real line is
the easiest to understand, and for that reason I would prefer
such a system for those cases where a choice must be made.  I
believe that the SUO must be made as simple as possible to learn
and use, even if alternative representations have some greater
conceptual elegance.

   One question of interest for the SUO, then, is whether we can
find some set of axioms that will allow more than one of the
basic time theories to be used for descriptions of physical
processes and events, where an uncertainty variable always
greater than 0 is included as an expressed or implied element of
every assertion about physical quantities, including time.  Or
will it still be necessary to permit only one of the time
theories to be used?  In the latter case all theories of time
might still be "defined" under different names, in logical terms
such as those Pat Hayes uses in his paper, but the use of all but
one would be deprecated.
    If some ontologist wants to represent a physical system with
a zero uncertainty (infinite precision), then in addition to the
logical inconsistencies that might arise, there will also be the
problem of the inability to represent infinite precision in a
computer.  As soon as one starts to replace the logical symbols
with actual numbers representing measurements in some physical
unit of measure, there will be some minimum number that will be
able to be represented; anything smaller will cause an underflow
and in most systems will be equivalent to zero.  This may be even
more troublesome than the logical inconsistency.  This is another
reason to try to find a physically realistic representation of
physical quantities, including time.

    An example of a kind of predicate using uncertainty would be
a non-transitive "equality" relation expressing the notion that
two measured quantities are indistinguishable (physequal) if the
differences are less than some minimum measurable difference ?z
(the "granularity" of the physical unit, depending on a
particular context), all three quantities being expressed in the
same physical units of measure.  Here the definitions of
lessthan, greaterthanorequalto, absolute-val, and  difference are
as their names suggest from ordinary arithmetic on real numbers:

Trying to adhere to the notation in Pat's paper, the definition
would be:
-------------------------
(predicative physvar1)
(predicative measure)
(predicative uncertainty)
(defrelation  physequal (?x ?y ?z) :=
(=&gt;  (and (physvar ?x ?y ?z) (measure ?x ?y) (uncertainty ?z))
     (lessthan (absolute-val (difference ?x ?y)) ?z)
))

(defrelation  physgreater (?x ?y ?z) :=
(=&gt; (and (physvar ?x ?y ?z) (measure ?x ?y)  (uncertainty ?z))
     (greaterthanorequalto (absolute-val (difference ?x ?y)) ?z)
))

(defrelation  physlessthan (?x ?y ?z) :=
(=&gt; (and (physvar ?x ?y ?z) (measure ?x ?y)  (uncertainty ?z))
     (greaterthanorequalto (absolute-val (difference ?y ?x)) ?z)
))
----------------

For two time intervals (open or closed) on a time continuum, with
duration greater than the granularity ?z and with (startpoint,
endpoint) being (a,b) and (c,d) respectively, the notion of
"meets" might then be defined:

(defrelation  meets (?a ?b ?c ?d ?z) :=
(=&gt;  (and (interval (?a,?b) (?c,?d))  (uncertainty ?z))
     (lessthan (absolute-val (difference ?c ?b)) ?z)
))

Truth:
   Using an uncertainty of time measurement ?z, to assert that a
fact is "true at some time point t" must be interpreted as saying
that it is true at *some* point within a time interval (t - ?z, t
+ ?z).
   It is also a given in experimental systems that, even after
assuming some limits of error, the measurements we make may
occasionally be incorrect.  That also has to be represented,
somehow.
--------------------

    Other relations on time intervals that express the notions of
precedes, overlaps, starts, finishes, and during will also need
to be defined using similar notions of uncertainty.  Granularity
is of course much-discussed, and such definitions have probably
been created many times, but I am not familiar with that
literature, and Pat may be able to point out pertinent
references.  I do not recall any of the contributions to this
list up to this point discussing an axiomatization of
uncertainty.  The particular question that Pat Hayes can probably
answer, when the physvar1 variables (measured quantities) are
time intervals, is:

==&gt; can more than one of the time theories he describes be used
and provide consistent inferences for physical time-point and
time-interval relations defined in a manner that includes an
uncertainty measure?


============================================================

General comments:

     Some others on this list as well as myself have expressed
concern that to develop a fully-functional and complete upper
ontology is likely to take substantially more effort and
coordination than is possible with a voluntary effort;
nevertheless I think that an important and achievable goal of
the SUO is to learn just how much representational formalism must
be discarded in order to provide a logically coherent defining
vocabulary of meaningful concepts -- not just syntactic symbols -
- that can maximize the range of representable concepts and be
used for practical purposes.  Another realistic hope is to make
enough progress to induce the kind of substantial funding
necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of a widely-used standard.
These are my own views and they may not be shared by the majority
of this discussion group.
   The present SUO project is being conducted under the aegis of
the IEEE, an organization whose orientation is toward very
practical, utilitarian goals.  In the case of the SUO the
objective is to build a representation system that may be used by
thousands of programmers.  The SUO project is fortunate to have
not just one but several logicians and philosophers willing to
provide valuable insights into fundamental conceptual problems.
Since logical precision is an important goal of the SUO, their
contributions are indispensable.  I hope that the logicians will
be able to provide precise tools that will accommodate the
practical goals of the project.  One important contribution will
be the clarification of the choices that need to be made,
whenever logical consistency permits only one representational
formalism.

which one might sensibly ask `When?'.  #$TemporalThing therefore
includes many things, such as actions, tangible objects,
agreements, and abstract pieces of time. Some things are NOT
instances of #$TemporalThing because they are abstract, timeless,
etc. -- such as a mathematical set, an attribute, an integer,
etc.")

(#$comment #$TimeInterval "#$TimeInterval is a subset of
#$TemporalThing.  Each #$TimeInterval can be characterized fully
just by specifying its temporal attributes.  Anything which has a
temporal extent is an instance of #$TemporalThing, but if that is
essentially ALL that it has, then it is also a #$TimeInterval.
For example, `the year 1967' is a just a #$TimeInterval: although
many interesting things happened during that year, the year
itself is completely defined by its temporal extent.  `Neil
Armstrong Walking on the Moon' is an #$Event, not a
#$TimeInterval, since it would be defined by many non-temporal
assertions. And of course, `Neil Armstrong' is a
#$SomethingExisting, not a #$TimeInterval, but like all instances
of #$SomethingExisting, he does have temporal extent and is
therefore a #$TemporalThing.  One could, in principle, separately
reify (name) the #$TimeInterval which is the period of existence
of any #$SomethingExisting, or the period of time during which
any #$Event occurred, but in practice that is rarely useful.
Since they all have an implicit #$TimeInterval associated with
them, any predicates which one might apply to time intervals can
also be applied to a football game, a football, etc.  E.g., we
can talk about the #$startingPoint of a football game, or for
that matter the #$startingPoint of the football itself (the
moment of its creation).")
