Jon Awbrey: JA
Kevin Johnson: KJ

KJ: This I can understand and appreciate but I had the sense
    that you wished to use the massaged example as an exemplar
    to dismiss the Liar paradox generally.

JA: I think it's something to think about, but I have not looked much further into it.
    Charles Peirce gave a similar, but much more detailed analysis of the Liar Paradox,
    so I may take the time to revisit that.
 
KJ: I have 'Vicious Circles' already checked out (different discussion).
    I checked the library here and they have at least half a dozen fairly
    recent texts on/discussing it (liar paradox), including the other text
    you mentioned by Barwise and Etchemendy.  A popular topic.

KJ: There is another example given by Professor Mark Sainsbury in the
    'Oxford Companion to Philosophy' on page 482 (drawn from Chapter 5
    of his own book 'Paradoxes').   Do you have the same analysis?

MS: | &quot;Jill says 'I am now not speaking truly'.
    | If Jill is not speaking truly when this
    | is what she says she is up to, she is
    | speaking truly.  If she is speaking truly,
    | then she must be doing what she says, that is,
    | not speaking truly.  So, it seems, what she
    | says is true if, and only if, it is not true.

IOU: The nice thing about the initial puzzle is that it was rendered
     in a flat enough form that one had a chance of telling on what
     grounds -- how shall I say? -- to address, approach, attack it,
     as Caesar might dixit.  Now the whole thing about these sorts
     of puzzles is that they invite the interpreter to make a few
     natural interpretive assumptions, out of charity, perhaps,
     but more likely out of innate instincts and inured habits,
     and then they trap you in being charitable or innocent to
     a fault.  So I would not even begin to touch a natural
     language specimen, encountered in its natural habitat,
     until I had a nimbler grasp of its natural semiotic
     environies.  So that is what I will do, but later.
 
JA: It is true that creatures such as we -- well, I should not presume on you,
    but I am pretty sure about the lion's share of me, anyway -- live and talk
    in spacetime.  Is that what you mean?  But can we not abstract for a' that?

KJ: I believe that human formal abstraction imports and over-in-lays its
    psychology onto/into the subject of its analysis.  In particular I am
    interested in the viewpoint limitations of 'normal' human analysis.

JA: Well, that is what we call a &quot;failure of sufficient abstraction&quot; (FOSA),
    since the aim of abstraction is precisely to lift the scales of overlay.
 
KJ: Interesting.  Is this your own terminology or?

I got it from &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;.

JA: As long as you take the statement &quot;S = Not S&quot; to be false,
    and just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic,
    you cannot imagine any substitution for S to make it true.

KJ: 'any substitution for S'

JA: &quot;just so long as you limit yourself to classical logic&quot;

KJ: I think you mean a conception of classical logic
    wherein paradoxes cannot be spoken of.  Certainly
    not the classical logic you have been currently
    using to speak of/about paradoxes.

JA: No, I mean the 'Classic' classical logic.
    It has axioms that can be recast like so:

JA: 1.  ((A, A)),  Identity.
    2.  (A, (A)),  Excluded Middle.
    3.  (A  (A)),  Non-Contradiction.

JA: For the other hemisphere:

    |    A   A            A          A
    |    o---o            o          o
    |     \ /         A   |          |
    |      o          o---o        A o
    |      |           \ /           |
    |      @            @            @
    |
    |   ((A, A))     (A, (A))     (A  (A))
    |
    |   Figure 1.    Figure 2.    Figure 3.
    |
    | Classical Axioms.  The Usual Unsuspects

This page looks best wben viewed under a fixed width character font.

JA: Of course, out of respect for the classics,
    I employed a lot of the logical redundants.

KJ: Ok.

KJ: Consider 'any substitution for S'.  

KJ: Now consider 'Not 'any substitution for S'' with respect to the former.

JA: You lost me here.  I am involved in considering a propositional expression,
    under the usual abuse of abstraction called &quot;Statement 0&quot;, in short, &quot;S_0&quot;.

|        S_1
|         o
|    S_1  |
|     o---o
|      \ /
|       o
|       |                S_0
|       @            =    @
|
| ((S_1 , (S_1) ))   =   S_0

JA: The point is that I, the un-confused one, is not required to do any
    substitution at all.  I can see just by looking at its logical form
    that S_0 is the negation of an axiom, a denial of an intitial grant,
    and I need not proceed any further, since I lack the funds to do so.

KJ: I understand that you interpret it as violating the logical form in that way.
    I am pointing out that 'looking at' is a double-edged sword.  It admits other
    equipollent interpretations.  Of course, you may not agree with the other
    interpretations.  For me it is interesting what interpretations are seen
    as powerful (more rational?).

How do you interpret the following line?
|
| 1.  Statement 1 is false.
|

I understand all about the power of delusions and illusions.
But I am not convinced that this particular one accords any
power to the one in its thrall.
 
KJ: A related discussion came up on another list.  I mentioned that the well-known
    flickering of the Necker Cube in perception studies may be indicative of how
    formal reason can/might perceive ambiguity (it does not do so simultaneously?).
    Foundational ambiguity would be ever more so difficult to ward against.
 
Hmm.

Jon
