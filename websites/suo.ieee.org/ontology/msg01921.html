Greetings David.  Pat has already responded to you, I see, but let me
add (and probably repeat) a couple of things.

&gt; What do you think of the method I used in
&gt; <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01016.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg01016.html</A> ?
&gt; ie:
&gt; R001:
&gt; (forall (?ANY)
&gt;     (= ?ANY ?ANY))

I think the syntactic connection between reference names and the content
they reference needs to be tighter, if only by enclosing the whole there
in brackets of some sort.  Also, I am dubious of using any sort of
numbering scheme, as order doesn't matter (except for purposes of
presentation).  A numbering scheme suggests that it does, and moreover,
if one wants to retain an ordering in the source that comports with the
numbering, would require renumbering all subsequence axioms whenever you
had to insert an axiom in the middle of the document.  That's nothing
but a waste of time.

&gt; I think it would be impossible to to be time-neutral.

Pat addressed this, and I agree with him.

&gt; &gt; 3. Some confusion results from the order in which things are
&gt; &gt; presented, and lack of clear statements as to what is primative.
&gt; &gt; Some things that are stated as axioms or theorems seem to either be
&gt; &gt; or need definitions.  Perhaps they are there but I haven't found
&gt; &gt; them.  The theorem on unions of classes struck me as lacking a
&gt; &gt; definition of union -- but I found it later on.   I'm still looking
&gt; &gt; for the definition of 'empty.'
&gt;
&gt; I agree this is a real issue to doing work solely with e-mail.

What is the issue?

&gt; &gt; ;;  -- I've thrown in the term 'particular' since particulars seem to be
&gt; &gt; ;;  lurking
&gt; &gt; ;;  in the background.  I'm not sure this is essential at this stage, but
&gt; &gt; ;;  I'm more comfortable including them.
&gt;
&gt; Just as long as you realize that some of us have no idea what a particular
&gt; might be.

How about a thing that doesn't have a set as its extension?  (Not that I
necessarily endorse introducing this class, but we can certainly make
perfectly good sense of it both axiomatically and semantically.)

&gt; (I personally think that they are similar to instances of a class)

Not at all what John has in mind, since *everything* is an instance of
some class, whereas particulars are simply things that aren't classes
or, more generally, relations.

&gt; I included axioms in my structural ontology specifically to define
&gt; what well-formed means.

Well-formedness has to be spelled out explicitly via a BNF or some
equivalent recursive mechanism.  This is usually done
metalinguistically, but, of course, one could incorporate the content of
a BNF into an ontology whose language has enough expressive firepower.

&gt; &gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Everything is either a relation or a particular")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (forall (?x) (or ((relation ?x) (particular ?x))
&gt;
&gt; The KIF says inclusive or But your comment implies exclusive or.

No it doesn't.  He gets the exclusive reading by ruling out the
possibility of inclusivity in his next axiom.

&gt; I'm uncomfortable with this. are you saying that (particular instance-of)
&gt; is false?

Its falsity will follow as a theorem, given his exclusivity axiom.

&gt; but you earlier said instance-of  specifically is an instance of
&gt; the class 'relation'.  I'm confused.

Because you are confusing instances with particulars.

&gt; &gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Nothing is both a relation and a particular")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (forall (?x) (not
&gt; &gt;                (and (relation ?x)  (particular ?x))))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; My comment applies here too.

This axiom simply rules out overlap between the two classes.

Regards,

-chris
