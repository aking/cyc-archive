John Sowa:

&gt; &gt;I would agree. And in fact, I think that the distinction
&gt; &gt;between the terms "continuant" and "occurrent" can be quite
&gt; &gt;nicely defined in Whitehead's terms: A continuant is something
&gt; &gt;that we can recognize at multiple encounters. An occurrent is
&gt; &gt;something that does not have enough distinctive characteristics
&gt; &gt;that we can be sure whether another encounter is with "the same"
&gt; &gt;or "a similar" entity.

Robert Meersman:

&gt;### a most enlightening definition I must say. But in it, and in
&gt;fact in all of the above, who are these "we" and "I" who do the
&gt;recognizing and identifying... I tried to observe before that all
&gt;of semantics constitutes an agreement among cognitive agents

Im afraid I disagree, and moreover think that this view is profoundly 
misleading (please don't quote Peircian chapter and verse in 
response.) Here's why, in brief: it confuses *semantic* issues with 
*epistemic* issues; it assumes that meaning is ultimately concerned 
with what 'we' (or maybe 'they') can know, and how they come to know 
it. I think this is deeply and profoundly ass-backwards, since until 
we have some reasonably clear account of what it is that we (or they) 
are knowing, it is both premature and rather hopeless to try to think 
about how it is that it (whatever it is) can be known. Meaning is not 
reducible to agency; rather, agency presumes meaning.

&gt; (e.g.
&gt;two persons who agree they are pointing at the same occurrent; or
&gt;one agent who agrees with himself that he is looking at an instance
&gt;of the same continuant after a while, etc etc. Is this too trivial
&gt;to mention, or am I too obtuse, in hypothesizing that we include
&gt;these cognitive agents, AND perhaps the procedure by which they
&gt;arrive at their agreements, AND the contexts that must restrict or
&gt;qualify these agreements, as first-class citizens in any ontological
&gt;design process?

That is not too trivial by any means, but I think it is a very bad 
methodology.  How will the project get started? You need to 'include' 
a theory of agency, etc., into the ontology. Now, how does one 
include anything in an ontology? One writes axioms about it (or them) 
with the intention of representing in those axioms enough information 
about the things in question that relevant questions can be answered 
by drawing conclusions from those axioms. So the proposal amounts to 
begin by writing an axiomatic theory of cognitive agents, procedures 
by which they arrive at agreements, and contexts in which they 
perform. Now, how will you get started on writing those axioms? This 
is where we came in, of ocurse, but doesnt that seem like a rather 
bad place to *start*? Cogntive agents are rather complicated things 
compared to, say, processes arising in the oil industry, or clay 
being fired in kilns. And you still need to know if these cognitive 
agents and their doings are going to be described as continuants or 
4-d histories or whatever.

Pat Hayes

PS. John's suggested definition (above) of continuant/occurrent is 
faulty on at least three counts. First, it doesn't actually capture 
the meaning, since one can easily recognize an occurrent when it is 
seen a second time, eg if you ever go to use the rest room during a 
football match, you will have no trouble recognising that you are at 
the same match when you get back.  Second, even if it was adequate, 
it isn't a definition of continuant, but a way to transcribe the 
occurrent notion into a 4-d ontological framework without 
acknowledging the continuant identity criteria, which we already know 
is easy; and third, it uses scare-quotes, which is just a way of not 
actually giving a real definition, but saying something that looks 
like a definition, but isn't really: as Russell said (in a different 
context), it has all the advantages of theft over honest toil.
