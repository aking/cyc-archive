&gt; &gt; Sorry, we are getting our communication wires crossed by a pun
&gt; &gt; on "class".  Mathematicians use the word in a very particular way,
&gt; &gt; which in its full form is written "proper class", to refer to things
&gt; &gt; that anyone but a mathematican (and even some of them) would call a set,
&gt; &gt; except they are so big that if they are accepted into the set-theoretic
&gt; &gt; universe they would give rise to paradoxes.  In the wider word, however,
&gt; &gt; the term "class" is used in a sense which is closely linked to 
&gt;"classification",
&gt; &gt; to refer to (the extension of) a named category in some kind of 
&gt;classification
&gt; &gt; heirarchy.  Such classes all have sets as their extension (or, 
&gt;maybe, ARE sets),
&gt; &gt; but not every set would normally be dignified with the title of 
&gt;'class(ification)'
&gt;
&gt;Hey, I'm just the messenger.  This is set theory as she is spoke.
&gt;You will be misunderstood by anybody who has had even one course
&gt;in set theory.  But I suppose that you guys like to be surprised.

True, and we will need to take pains to guard against 
misunderstandings. All these words have somewhat different meanings 
to various audiences. Regrettably, perhaps, very few people have 
taken even one course in set theory.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this usage would conflict with most usages of 'class' in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modern ontological usage.  (Another related word is 'sort').
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect there is no real hope of having this peculiar
&gt; &gt; &gt; usage extend to the broader technical community.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Im afraid that this sense of 'class' has already been
&gt; &gt; in widespread use throughout at least one of the broader
&gt; &gt; technical ontology communities for about a decade now.
&gt;
&gt;Ten years?  Ten years!  What is that in the Cosmic Scheme of things!?

Long enough for a large community of people to be using the term 
actively in a particular way, and their potential misunderstandings 
also need to be addressed. One cannot simply declare set theory to be 
the Received Language and assume that the rest of the world are 
simply ignoramuses.

&gt;Having spent my time in the field of psychology, I am well aware of
&gt;this "decadent" perspective on the world, and the 5-10 yr window on
&gt;the literature that they have.  I have also run into this class of
&gt;folks who are so busy weaving their web thesauri around our necks
&gt;that they never seem to have the time to actually consult one --
&gt;maybe John Sowa can educate them, not I -- as Frank Lloyd Wright
&gt;said, "Experts don't have to think, they know."  Hey, we all make
&gt;mistakes -- I am the expert at that -- but I do not understand this
&gt;pride that some people have in their ignorance.  People cannot just
&gt;go about making up arbitrary definitions for stuff like "aggregate",
&gt;"class", "composite", "concept", "extension", "genus", "hypostasis",
&gt;"intension", "kind", "reification", "relation", "set", "species",
&gt;just to mention a few of the novelties that I have heard in the
&gt;last six months, without expecting a little trouble.

Well, you know, actually, they can. Mathematics routinely uses words 
with existing meanings and cannibalises them to serve other agendas. 
"Set" itself provides an example, as do "group", "field", "filter", 
"lattice" and so on.

&gt; But when
&gt;you tell them the history of the words, they act like they are
&gt;outside of history or something.

Insofar as it concerns English usage, they largely are, in my view.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Check out the literature on description logics and
&gt; &gt; such ontological 'standards' as LOOM and CLASSIC.
&gt;
&gt;Wait a minute ...
&gt;Wait a minute ...
&gt;Aren't you the one who is suspicious of "standards"?

I used scare quotes, my dear fellow. My point was only that these 
things are considered definitive by a community.

.....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Someone whose philosophical tastes run in one or the other direction
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is free to impose their tastes on the semantic theory, and then the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logic will 'work' within those tastes perfectly well.  For example,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if someone wanted to say that properties are not identical to their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extension, but that classes are, ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have trouble understanding this.  I am used to saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; that a set (a LAMP set) is "determined by" its extension,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but never that a set is "identical to" its extension.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For the first time in this message you leave me confused.  In what way
&gt; &gt; does a set (a LAMP set) differ from its extension?  Certainly any set
&gt; &gt; described by ZF set theory is identical to its extension.  The extension
&gt; &gt; of a set S is the set of members of S, and that must be S by the axiom of
&gt; &gt; extensionality.
&gt;
&gt;One of the ways that the word "extension" has always
&gt;been used is to speak of the "extension of a term" or
&gt;the "extension of a concept" (concept = mental term).
&gt;It is usually acknowledged that one can do this without
&gt;invoking the extraneous existence of another entity like
&gt;a class, a collection, a set, or what have you, that the
&gt;term or the concept itself already does the job that one
&gt;might want the objectively existing extra entity for --
&gt;these are radically nominal thinkers who say this stuff,
&gt;but it is one of the varieties of minimalism that even
&gt;Russell sought in the form of his "No Class" theory.
&gt;
&gt;So the extension of a term or concept is not a set --
&gt;they do not admit the existence of such a thing --
&gt;it is just all of the individual extendees.
&gt;It is just the way that these people talk!

Ah, I see. But surely if one is already talking about sets, then 
there is no distinction between a set, and the extension of *that 
set*, is there?

&gt;One way to rationalize this talk is to say that we actually mispeak
&gt;ourselves whenever we speak of "the extension" as a substantive noun,
&gt;that we have thereby reified what is really a relation, "extension of",
&gt;and thus created the illusion of a fictitious hypostatic otiose entity.

Yes, I see the point. Linguists sometimes call this 'plural 
reference', I believe.

.....
&gt; &gt; Do not read "class" as meaning "proper class" in the
&gt; &gt; mathematical sense, but rather as "classification".
&gt;
&gt;This sounds like "natural kinds" talk.  Is that it?

Well, now I am simply the messenger. I think that this is the basic 
idea. However, to assert that classes are all natural kinds would, I 
suspect, be considered an unwarranted claim by those who use the term 
in this way.

&gt;At any rate, it's not a matter of getting just me or
&gt;a couple hundred other folks to experiment with your
&gt;novelties.

They are not mine. I simply bow to public pressure.
