Hi Jon,
<p>By way of reference, a fuller excerpt from the Peirce manuscript from
which you take your quotation:
<p>§6. RELATIVES OF SECOND INTENTION
<p>&nbsp;488. The general method of graphical representation of propositions
has now been given in all its essential elements, except, of course, that
we have not, as yet, studied any truths concerning special relatives; for
to do so would seem, at first, to be "extralogical." Logic in this stage
of its development may be called paradisaical logic, because it represents
the state of Man's cognition before the Fall. For although, with this apparatus,
it is easy to write propositions necessarily true, it is absolutely impossible
to write any which is necessarily false, or, in any way which that stage
of logic affords, to find out that anything is false. The mind has not
as yet eaten of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Truth and Falsity.
Probably it will not be doubted that every child in its mental development
necessarily passes through a stage in which he has some ideas, but yet
has never recognised that an idea may be erroneous; and a stage that every
child necessarily passes through must have been formerly passed through
by the race in its adult development. It may be doubted whether many of
the lower animals have any clear and steady conception of falsehood; for
their instincts work so unerringly that there is little to force it upon
their attention. Yet plainly without a knowledge of falsehood no development
of discursive reason can take place.
<br>Peirce: CP 3.489 Cross-Ref:††
<br>&nbsp;489. This paradisaical logic appears in the study of nonrelative
formal logic. But there no possible avenue appears by which the knowledge
of falsehood could be brought into this Garden of Eden except by the arbitrary
and inexplicable introduction of the Serpent in the guise of a proposition
necessarily false. The logic of relatives, affords such an avenue, and
that, the very avenue by which in actual development, this stage of logic
supervenes. It is the avenue of experience and logical reflexion.
<br>Peirce: CP 3.490 Cross-Ref:††
<br>&nbsp;490. By logical reflexion, I mean the observation of thoughts
in their expressions. Aquinas remarked that this sort of reflexion is requisite
to furnish us with those ideas which, from lack of contrast, ordinary external
experience fails to bring into prominence. He called such ideas second
intentions. It is by means of relatives of second intention that the general
method of logical representation is to find completion.
<p>I see that in this context your excerpt from the above, <i>viz</i>.,
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>
<pre>490. By logical reflexion, I mean the observation of thoughts in their expressions. Aquinas remarked that this sort of reflexion is&nbsp;
requisite to furnish us with those ideas which, from lack of contrast, ordinary external experience fails to bring into prominence. He&nbsp;
called such ideas second intentions. It is by means of relatives of second intention that the general method of logical representation is&nbsp;
to find completion.

</pre>
</blockquote>
refers to the observational logic of "experience and reflection," or, in
other words, to logical critic, as opposed to the "paradisaical logic"
which forms part of the "nonrelative formal logic" discussed earlier in
the manuscript. Critic= fiinally, we might know "true" from "false." Anyhow,
the only possibility of ever approaching that is by close observation.
<p>Thus Peirce gives the definition:
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>
<pre>By logical reflexion, I mean the observation of thoughts in their expressions.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><br>Which is to hold that critical logic is an observational science,
so in its essence diagrammatic. Here one sees both the similiarity of logic
to mathematics, and the difference. For while logic "observes," it doesn't
observe "pure possibilities"--like mathematics--but thought in all its
richness and complexity, tied to a
<b>real</b> world. So we, in our essential
humaness, participate in thought in its movement; or, alternatively, are
<b><i>in</i></b>
this thought of a world of experience--in fine, a<b> real world</b>.
<p>Moreover, it is apparently possible for us to discern the true from
the false in some matters of great importance (science and its subsequent
technologies fairly proves that this is the case in at least <b>that</b>
domain). The concept of the final logical interpretant further suggests
that we then ought reasonably to modify our conduct in the direction of
the truth that<b><i> we </i></b>have become assured of.
<p>[Perhaps we will one day create the conditions for such a modification
at the socio-cultural level--and not just the pull-yourself-up-by-your-boot-straps--level
of the extraordinary individual.]
<p>Next Peirce comments:
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>
<pre>Aquinas remarked that this sort of reflexion is requisite to furnish us with
&nbsp; | those ideas which, from lack of contrast, ordinary external experience fails
&nbsp; | to bring into prominence.</pre>
</blockquote>
In short, the mighty impact of secondness, of the sensual, of the world--is
so overpowering that without the "distancing" that reflection, that thirdness,
affords we would never <b><i>know</i></b> that there even<b> is</b> "a
world;" and&nbsp; consequently we'd be as innocent as the plants and animals.
{I myself would have then have liked to be a pampered tom cat or some meadow
heather in a temperate clime.}
<p>But since we have indeed "lost our innocence" (and "lost our way" as
far as I'm concerned), then we of sound mind ought work together to try
to make some sense out of
<i>our world.</i> It doesn't even take an eco-alarmist
to realize that if we don't do this soon (in the next 50-100 years?) there
won't be a world to be responsible to. (But that's another issue.) Meanwhile,
we ought to at least attempt to be true the Peircean
<i>summum bonum</i>
of science, namely, the "reasonable in itself."
<p>Refering again to Aquinas:
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>
<pre>He called such ideas 'second intentions'.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><br>Our second intentions turn out, it seems to me, to be exactly related
to that human "second nature" which famously makes us<i> homo sapiens</i>--we
are fated to be reflective, to look at things not only "subjectively" but
also "objectively," that is,&nbsp; to think diagrammatically according
to Peirce's model (or we wouldn't even be able to frame these concepts,
to have art and science, philosophy, politics, technology, mass culture,
the "good and the bad and the ugly," etc.)
<p>Finally:
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>
<pre>It is
&nbsp; | by means of 'relatives of second intention' that the general method of
&nbsp; | logical representation is to find completion.</pre>
</blockquote>
Therefore, critical logic seems to be this clear and adequate observation
of diagrams relating to this-<i>-our--</i>reality (not just those observations
referring to "mere"&nbsp; possibilities--which is the great work of mathematics).
Critical logic concerns itself finally with truth and falsity in the<b><i>
real
</i></b>world and all its representations (<b><i><u>our</u></i></b>
representations)--that is, when it is ultimately taken up by metaphysics,
when<i> that</i> very <b>real </b>science (metaphysics--the science of
the real in all its manifestations) becomes convinced--by methodeutic and
through rhetoric--of the validity of the matters upon which Critic has
passed judgment formally. (This is not expressed well--Lord, I hate my
convoluted style! I too tend to think better in diagrams than in words.)
<p>So now I see more fully the eminent and imminent need in logic for such
things as conceptual graphs and (here's a leap) the Semantic Web. Here,
finally,&nbsp; critical logic (as second) and methodeutic/rhetoric (as
third) might meet to inform us of t<b>hat</b> before which we stand and
need to act together <i>in our own best interest</i>. May we each have
the humility finally to press our shoulders to that communal task, apart
from the furtherance of our egoic needs
<p>(However, sometimes I wonder just how long it will take before we reach
deep consensus on things even "methodological" let alone those issues of
"vital importance.")
<p>You, and John Sowa, and Mary Keeler, and Joseph Ransdell, and Lucia
Santaella and--of course--Tim BL, and&nbsp; others might yet help bring
about the transformation that we all desire, and even more, that we need!
No doubt the work of Charles Peirce will remain central to that endeavor
(as it is, for example, to conceptual graphs as regards both their form
and possible content).
<p>Thank you all for your excellent work.
<p>We <i>are</i> in a new era. So we ought try to colloborate as fully
as we can--in the spirit of that idealistic-realistic-pragmatic Peircean
"community of researchers"--to achieve. . .what? . . . scientific quasi-consensus?
Now I'm at a loss. It's seems clear enough that the scientific <i>summum
bonum</i> might be designated "the reasonable in itself." But what is <i><b>our
</b>summum
bonum</i>, taking into consideration not just that one, but all three of
the Universes of experience?
<p>Best regards, Jon. You continue to be an inspiration.
<p>Gary
<p>PS I'm beginning to be able to follow such a dialog as you and John
Sowa entertained here recently. Your question:
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>
<pre>Is one interpreter's object and interpretant of a given sign
necessarily every interpreter's object and interpretant of it?

</pre>
</blockquote>
is provocative and very interesting indeed. Is it&nbsp; in part answed
by Sowa's comment:
<blockquote TYPE=CITE>
<pre>> Therefore, an MPT is both an object-preserving translation (OPT)
> and an interpretant-preserving translation (IPT).&nbsp; It replaces the
> sign of the triad while leaving the other two corners unchanged.
></pre>
</blockquote>
? (MPT I take to mean "meaning preserving translation")
