&gt; 
&gt; david, you have called back to mind a number of loose threads
&gt; on the subject of quant calc that i cannot elaborate too much
&gt; at the moment but only try to collect them in one place again,
&gt; and maybe tie them to a title that i can find again in future.
&gt; 
&gt; exhibit 1.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; | In reference to the doctrine of individuals, two
&gt; | distinctions should be borne in mind.  The logical
&gt; | atom, or term not capable of logical division, must
&gt; | be one of which every predicate may be universally
&gt; | affirmed or denied.  For, let A be such a term.
&gt; | Then, if it is neither true that all A is X nor
&gt; | that no A is X, it must be true that some A is X
&gt; | and some A is not X;  and therefore A may be divided
&gt; | into A that is X and A that is not X, which is contrary
&gt; | to its nature as a logical atom.  

ok first off, if A is a term, it is a unit of syntax.
then when you talk of 'all A is X' or you talk of 'some A is not X'
I think you are mixing up syntax and semantics.
becasue A as a term can refer to individuals in the world.
(Are these called particulars?)
and it is those individuals that are X or not X.
the 'all' and 'some' quantifiers must semantically be referring
to those individuals. 
This is in contrast to the use of quantifiers as syntax.
In terms of syntax, I'm not sure how 'some' comes into play.
but 'there exists' is like an infinite OR connective
and 'for all' is like an infinite AND connective.
since both AND and OR can connect truth-valued terms to make a new term,
it is reasonable to allow 'there exists' and 'for all' to do so as well.

'some' as a connective doesn't make sense to me, as there is no way 
to talk about the truth value of a term made up using 'some'.
Unless you increase your truth-universe to include a bigger range of
values, and as an exercise in formalizing, I'm not sure what the much more
complicated world would gain you.

&gt; |Such a term can be
&gt; | realized neither in thought nor in sense.  Not in sense,
&gt; | because our organs of sense are special -- the eye, for
&gt; | example, not immediately informing us of taste, so that
&gt; | an image on the retina is indeterminate in respect to
&gt; | sweetness and non-sweetness.  When I see a thing, I do not
&gt; | see that it is not sweet, nor do I see that it is sweet;
&gt; | and therefore what I see is capable of logical division
&gt; | into the sweet and the not sweet.  It is customary to
&gt; | assume that visual images are absolutely determinate
&gt; | in respect to color, but even this may be doubted.
&gt; | I know of no facts which prove that there is never
&gt; | the least vagueness in the immediate sensation.

ok. using senses as a discriminator is not appropriate.
terms exist in the 'mind's eye' so to speak.
Senses can be used to discriminate the individuals we just talked of.
in a way of thinking, senses are a way of making real the X spoken of
before, as they help sort the some A into X and not X.
Again, the process of formalizing seems inextricably tied to the
idea of quantizing. The only question is what your quantum are. 

&gt; | In thought, an absolutely determinate term cannot
&gt; | be realized, because, not being given by sense,
&gt; | such a concept would have to be formed by synthesis,
&gt; | and there would be no end to the synthesis because
&gt; | there is no limit to the number of possible predicates.

If a term is not 'realized'=='made real' in thought, then where
can it be realized?  And while there is no limit to the number
of possible predicates, the whole POINT of the standard upper 
ontology is to try to come up with a limited, useful set, with
clear definitions, useful for this synthesis. 

&gt; | A logical atom, then, like a point in space, would involve
&gt; | for its precise determination an endless process.  We can
&gt; | only say, in a general way, that a term, however determinate,
&gt; | may be made more determinate still, but not that it can be
&gt; | made absolutely determinate.  Such a term as &quot;the second
&gt; | Philip of Macedon&quot; is still capable of logical division --
&gt; | into Philip drunk and Philip sober, for example;  but
&gt; | we call it individual because that which is denoted
&gt; | by it is in only one place at one time.  It is a term
&gt; | not 'absolutely' indivisible, but indivisible as long
&gt; | as we neglect differences of time and the differences
&gt; | which accompany them.  Such differences we habitually
&gt; | disregard in the logical division of substances.

Agreed, logical formalization is a continuing process, involving
careful differentiation and axioms to well define exactly what is being
stated. We're humans, and not machines.  Again, I think there is a
confusing on words here. 'term' is typically a syntax word, and
the discrimination discussed is semantic discrimination.

Isn't the point of modules being discussed previously that 
each way of distinguishing each group and ignoring other
differences implicitly defines a module?

&gt; | In the division of relations, etc., we do not,
&gt; | of course, disregard these differences, but we
&gt; | disregard some others.  There is nothing to prevent
&gt; | almost any sort of difference from being conventionally
&gt; | neglected in some discourse, and if 'I' be a term which
&gt; | in consequence of such neglect becomes indivisible in that
&gt; | discourse, we have in that discourse,
&gt; |
&gt; |                    ['I'] = 1.
&gt; |

Ah, some confusing algebra that means absolutely nothing.
Is [] an array? is it a set of values? is it a set of instances that
can all be grouped because the term I describes them?
Is it a count of the letters in a string?
Is the equal sign showing a equality of balance where both are the 
same ?  Is it an assignment? What does this have to do with discourse?
etc.

&gt; | This distinction between the absolutely indivisible and
&gt; | that which is one in number from a particular point of view
&gt; | is shadowed forth in the two words 'individual' ('to atomon')
&gt; | and 'singular' ('to kath ekaston');  but as those who have
&gt; | used the word 'individual' have not been aware that absolute
&gt; | individuality is merely ideal, it has come to be used in
&gt; | a more general sense.  (CP 3.93, CE 2.389-390).
&gt; |
&gt; | [ Note on the square bracket notation that was used above.
&gt; | | Peirce explains this notation at CP 3.65, also CE 2.366.
&gt; | |
&gt; | | | I propose to denote the number of a logical term by
&gt; | | | enclosing the term in square brackets, thus, ['t'].
&gt; | |
&gt; | | The &quot;number&quot; of an absolute term, as in the case of 'I',
&gt; | | is defined as the number of individuals that it denotes.
&gt; | ]

cool. I wish I had understood this more the first time I read it.
So ['I'] = 1 is roughly size_of(denoted_set_of(I)) equals 1.

Not a totally unreasonable notation, but not one that I would have easily
guessed. 
Does it even make sense to say that there any term that denotes 
an absolutely indivisible group of individuals ?

They are individuals, right? so you can individuate them, right?
so you can tell them apart. So if there a a group of them, that
means you have decided not to tell them apart. You can give a name
to any group, even if it is longwinded like

TheGroupOfIndividualDustParticlesThatLandedOnMyHeadOn13-Dec-2001

but now that I have decided to name that Group, it is indivisible as
far as that name is concerned. If I bring another name into play
that interacts with that name, then I can divide that group easily.
I would expect the interest of the Standard Upper Ontology would be
to provide a pre-selected list of names and definitions that allow
that dividing up process to be possible for computers.

&gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce,
&gt; |&quot;Description of a Notation for the Logic of Relatives,
&gt; | Resulting from an Amplification of the Conceptions of Boole's Calculus of Logic&quot;,
&gt; |'Memoirs of the American Academy', Volume 9, pages 317-378, 26 January 1870,
&gt; |'Collected Papers' (CP 3.45-149), 'Chronological Edition' (CE 2, 359-429).

&gt; 

This stuff is interesting, but how can we leverage this insight into a way 
to describe the world formally to a computer so it can use it in an
ontology?

1) We've said that we can name things.   - nothing new
2) We've said names divide up the world. - nothing new
3) We've said sensory perceptions divide up the world. - nothing new
4) We've said names can be connected to make terms     - nothing new
5) We've said there are syntactic quantifiers - nothing new
6) We've said there are semantic quantifiers - nothing new

So this was delightful, and all, but what did this post help us
clarify in the process of formalizing ontologies?

David
