Thanks Pat, 
	.		Some progress. My lack of training in the field is
becoming relevant.

&gt;PH&gt;
&gt;Maybe it would be useful if you were to tell us what YOU mean by
'relation'?
&gt;I havnt been able to follow several of your messages on this topic. For
&gt;example, I don't know any sense in which a relation could be said to be
&gt;4-dimensional (or indeed n-dimensional for any n).
&gt;
&gt;GH2&gt;	Here is an example.
&gt;
&gt;GH2&gt;	From a business modelling perspective, suppose we have a supplier, a
&gt;customer and a product. Relations(hips) between the supplier and customer
&gt;include:

Hey, wait a minute. Don't identify 'relation' with 'relationship'.  The
following all seem to me to be entities of various kinds, not  relations.

&gt;*	advice of conditions for a transaction,

a communication event or act

&gt;*	order for product,

Another one

&gt;*	delivery of for the product. delivered

a physical event

&gt;*	billing for cost for the product. delivered

a communication event?

&gt;*	payment of money for the product. delivered

a legal or commercial event?

There are relations which closely correspond to the existence of these
events, but one has to keep things straight to avoid confusion., For
example, in a billing, there is the relation (between two agents,
presumably, and a time) of a billing event having occurred (or, a bill
having been sent) between the agents at the time. But the event, and the
relation, are not the same kind of thing, and can't be identified with each
other.

GH3&gt;	I'm trying to scope "relation". The event was a process which took a
finite period of time to occur. Is the relation the fact that this occurred
between the two parties? If the situation was that of a regular customer,
would the facts of repeated billings be the one relation, or one for each
billing, or would the fact of the repetition be a separate relation in
addition to each of the individual billing relations? 

&gt;GH2&gt;	In this case all the relations are communications. If we used mail,
&gt;all would use the same transport mechanism. These days, more likely 4
&gt;would be information transfer (especially if one accepts money as a form
&gt;of information), and the other one a physical delivery.
&gt;
&gt;GH2&gt;	In other cases the relations could be other sorts of processes, such
&gt;as transformation (eg. during manufacture). As I mentioned before, they
&gt;could also be processes like learning, and interpersonal relations.

But why do you call these 'relations' ? A process is a kind of entity, not a
relation between entities. (Again, as in the billing case, there is an
associated relation, which can be characterised as the existence of the
process involving the relatees.)

&gt;
&gt;GH2&gt;	But in each case the relation has time related characteristics, such
&gt;as stages and/or varying magnitudes. Many also have spatial attributes, ie
&gt;they take place at/between/around/etc. locations.

Events or processes have these attributes; relations do not. Even in a 3-d
continuant/occurrent ontology, the times at which relations hold are not
attributes of the relations, but of instances of the relations corresponding
to 'situations' (or whatever those central things are called).

&gt;GH2&gt;	I wonder whether we can get to a stage where we can appreciate each
&gt;other's concepts of relation.

I'm using the word in the sense in which it used throughout logic (including
SUO-KIF) and mathematics. 

GH3&gt;	Obviously, I don't appreciate that sense of the word yet. 

&gt;In my case, the next thing I need to
&gt;understand is the meaning of "extension", as you used it above. 

Do you know what a set is? If so, the extension of a unary predicate is
simply the set of all the things that the predicate is true of. For binary
relations, it's the set of all pairs of things that the elation holds
between; for trinary relations, it's the set of all triples, etc. .A basic
assumption of logical languages is that relations with the same extension
are the same relation; or, in other words, the logic only really talks about
the extensions.

GH3&gt;	You seem to have dropped the bit of text where the use of
"extension" occurred, so that this bit has lost its context. As it happens,
I don't have 100% recall, and now don't recall how it was applied. 

GH3&gt;	While I do know what a set is, I don't know about "predicate". I
only learned of the linguistic definition as that potion of a sentence
excluding the subject and verb. But, let's have a go. Does this mean, say,
that the relation of "billing by post" is a triple, say: (vendor, bill,
client), that applies to every instance where a vendor has posted a bill to
a client and the client received the bill? 

&gt;GH2&gt;	I feel there is an important aspect to this. That is that the SUO
&gt;should be able to be comprehended by its users. Only that way, will they be
&gt;able to use it with confidence of being accurate.
&gt;
&gt;GH2&gt;	Therefore, I suggest we are going to have to find means of
&gt;describing the underlying principles in ordinary, everyday language that
the
&gt;non-cognoscenti are, at least in principle, able to understand. I believe
&gt;our target user population should not need to be graduates of high-flown
&gt;philosophy or logic courses to be able to understand the SUO.

Well, this raises an interesting issue of methodology. Making an ontology
isn't just writing down what you know in some semiformalized English which
any bloke can understand just by reading it.  It does involve at least some
technical competence and facility with the conventions of logic.  Not a
high-flown competence: just an intro. course would probably do the trick.
(Ive never taken a logic course in my life, for example.) The fact is that
any logical-based ontology will use logic, and if someone doesnt have even a
basic understanding of the principles of logic then they are likely to make
mistakes when using it. I don't see any way around this. If you want to lay
bricks, you have to know at least the basics of bricklaying, or your walls
will likely fall down. 

GH3&gt;	Well, what I would posit is that the relevant rules need to be
succinctly set out, possibly aided by examples, so that the uninitiated can
start at the beginning of the document and follow the logic through to the
end. It is acceptable for the introductory material to be set out in an
annex, or some other standard, but I would suggest it must be readily
available in a readily accessible form. 

GH3&gt;	For the SUO, this principle will be absolutely necessary if we are
to achieve widespread take-up. We cannot afford to hide behind the cloak of
an artisan's guild. 

GH3&gt;	I would prefer that we avoid esoteric language, and just say things
in plain English. For example, the essence of a wheeled vehicle is that it
incorporates one or more wheels on which it is capable of running to achieve
travel. I fully agree that we need to have an unambiguous language for
stating that, but we shouldn't forget that this sort of simple concept is
all we will be explaining for many instances in the SUO (cf. wheeled
ornament, and conceptual vehicle).
