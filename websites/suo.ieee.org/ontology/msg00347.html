Linear Algorithm for processing Sanskrit
A.V. Hudli , R. V. Hudli
"There is a recent interest world over for examining the suitability oF
Sanskrit for natural language processing [1,2,3,5,7]. It has been shown that
some of the knowledge representation structures developed by the AI
scientists have equivalences in Sanskrit. We outline the equivalence of
Conceptual Dependency and the ancient Indian logician's paraphrasing of
sentences. We give a linear algorithm that converts the logician's
paraphrases of sentences into Conceptual Dependency. We show that Sanskrit
sentences can be parsed in linear time.

"While sanskrit is the most natural language to express the Veda, until its
features are fully explored we will settle for Java for knowledge
representation. At this site we will offer some crash courses on both
traditional and modern techniques to help scholars at both ends acquire a
common understanding and a common language. "

&gt; &gt;Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence
&gt; &gt;Rick Briggs
&gt; &gt;AI Magazine 6(1): Spring 1985, 32-39
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Here is the abstract found at
&gt; &gt;<A  HREF="http://www.aaai.org//Library/Magazine/Vol06/06-01/vol06-01.html">http://www.aaai.org//Library/Magazine/Vol06/06-01/vol06-01.html</A>
&gt; &gt;(unfortunately, the full text does not appear to be available)
&gt;
&gt; Ive just read it. It is an exposition of the case structure of
&gt; Sanskrit, which appears to be quite elaborate. For example, the
&gt; (translation of) the sentence 'Out of friendship, A cooked rice for B
&gt; in a pot on the fire' is rendered as a structure equivalent to the
&gt; following set of triples:
&gt;
&gt; cook, agent, A
&gt; cook, object, rice
&gt; cook, instrument, fire
&gt; cook, recipient, B
&gt; cook, because-of, friendship
&gt; friendship, A, B
&gt; cook, locality, pot
&gt;
&gt; 'because-of' is an English gloss for a 'Point of Departure' case in
&gt; Sanskrit, roughly corresponding to cause.
&gt;
&gt; The paper also displays some semantic networks  (as they were called
&gt; in 1985) putting all this into graph form in obvious ways.
&gt;
&gt; The interesting historical fact is that the ancient Sanskrit
&gt; grammarians actually wrote about structures like this, apparently.
&gt; The language had explicit lexical case words and didnt rely on
&gt; implicit word ordering with prepositions, so the 'semantic' structure
&gt; was made more explicit. For example, where we would say "John is
&gt; going", the Sanskrit looks more like this:
&gt; "An Act is taking place in which the Agent is John, specified by
&gt; singularity and masculinity."
&gt; Briggs gives an actual translation for the cooking rice sentence,
&gt; which starts:" There is an activity conducive to a softening residing
&gt; in something not different from the rice, and which takes place in
&gt; the present, and resides in an agent...".
&gt; Acts are said to 'reside in' their agents, so that 'A gives B to C '
&gt; would have been expressed something like 'there is an act of giving
&gt; residing in A directed to C containing B', using the special Sanskrit
&gt; root form 'a-sri', meaning roughly 'tied to' or 'resting on'.
&gt; Processes such as cooking were thought of as divisible into
&gt; subprocesses, each maybe with its associated residings and locations,
&gt; so quite complex 'cases' could be composed from the basic set through
&gt; the process decompositions associated with verbs.
