Jean-Marc,

Yet Another Preamble (YAP):

Look, I am standing here in this prospective intersection,
trying to avoid being run over by the actual brute trucks
of hecate and haeceity.  I have a specialized set of aims
at the moment, developing the extensional aspect of signs,
just because this plot has lain fallow too long, and only
because these sorts of formal models are more adequate to
the complexity of the irresistable phenomena that impress
themselves on me at the moment, the realities, subtleties,
and tractions of which I can scarcely help but to respect.
What do you find so aerie-faerie in this?  It's work enuf
for one person, if not for the many.

&gt; Peirce's "mind-less" formal definitions are only
&gt; partially true because too abstract if they are
&gt; supposed to explain anything at all in practice.

This is dichotomous thinking.  The very way that you use
the term "mind-less" implies that a thing whose qualities
are independent of mind must therefore be exclusive of mind.

Besides, definitions do not explain.  Explanations explain.

I keep saying what Peirce and the whole classical and scholastic
tradition before him kept saying, that logic and psychology are
independent sciences -- the same thing would go for any other
transverse pair of normative and descriptive sciences -- and
you just seem to keep hearing the words "mutually repellant"
instead of "independent".  I do not get this.  Independent
sciences can even cover the very same context of phenomena,
without thereby tripping over or getting in each other's way.

      Dimension Of Mind

&gt; The formal definition from L75 only describes the sign
&gt; as one of the correlates of a triadic relation, i.e.
&gt; the sign as a being for an other.

I do not talk this way.  You just think this way.
I have said over [and over]* that the significance
of this particular definition is the way that it most
clearly defines the whole sign relation as the primary
subject of the definition, a relation in extension being
a set of triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;, etc, etc, etc.

&gt; But a sign has in fact two beings:
&gt; its being for an other (the object)
&gt; and its own being.

And every father is a son, except possibly for the boundary
conditions at the beginning and the end of time.  So what?

&gt; It is not an isolated entity because it belongs to a genuine triad,
&gt; but nevertheless its entire being is not completely swallowed by
&gt; the triadic relation either.

The entire being?  This is absolute essentialism again.
Being a sign at a particular moment is only one aspect
or the hypothetical "totality" of being of any entity.
Being a sign is a role of a being, not its essence.
Doesn't anybody just read anymore?

&gt; If the three elements (S, O, I) are of the nature of a sign, ...

This becomes non-sense at this point.

&gt; in that they take part in a triadic relation (Peirce writes
&gt; in the Lowell Lectures that they are of the nature of "thirds" ),
&gt; likewise, they have their own being, the interpretant has its own
&gt; being, the sign has its own being and the object has its own being.

All God's Chillun Got Their Own Being ...
That has little to do with being signs.

&gt; So if you start from a formal definition that only refer
&gt; to a triadic relation and believe that you can explain ...

It's not an explanation --
It's only a description --
Please!  No wagering!

&gt; everything from there, where each element is reduced to its mode of
&gt; being respective to the other correlates, then you are missing half
&gt; of the picture.  In asking "what is a sign?", do not simply answer
&gt; the question by saying how a sign enters in relation with the other
&gt; correlates, but ask yourself also what a sign in actu really is,
&gt; what is "an object of direct experience" like? and the object of
&gt; the sign:  what is a "fragment of history" like? and finally what
&gt; is the interpretant, what is the determination of a mind?  Or you
&gt; have only walked half the road.

I do not think that you get what formal models are for.
They are not intent to exhaust the being or even meant
to exhaust the description of any real thing.  At best,
they capture something of importance about that thing,
enough to get by for a while.  There does not have to
be any confounded kind of gawd-aweful death-struggle
between formal and practical.  The choice of a formal
model is a practical decision.  Formal is beautiful
and beautiful is practical, like I done tole you.

Jon Awbrey
