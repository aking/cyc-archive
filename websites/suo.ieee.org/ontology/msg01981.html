&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong with developing a formal calculus,

&gt; &gt; truth conditions.
&gt; 
&gt; Dear John, Jon, Folks--
&gt; 
&gt; My apologies for taking a small bit out of context in order to raise
&gt; a point and ask a question.  Most of what you all are discussing is
&gt; beyond me but I find the small part I think I can follow fascinating.
&gt; 
&gt; But first to briefly state where I'm coming from:  Seems to me that
&gt;
&gt; (1) logic is partly an attempt to clarify the
&gt;     nature (semantics and syntax) of propositions,

Jim, I view logic as a normative science.  This view has the following
array of logical implications and practical consequences.  As a science,
logic is a form of inquiry that seeks to end, like any form of inquiry,
a particular variety of uncertainty.  In the case of logic the specific
type of uncertainty in question is one as to how we ought to conduct our
reasoning in order to achieve the aim, end, goal, object, or "pragma" of
reasoning in general.  The normative quality of this science comes in with
the word "ought", but this is an "ought" that is related to a predesignated
object, and this, as you know, tends to bring down on the heads of pragmatic
thinkers the charge of crass utilitarianism, if not the moral equivalent of
warlocks.  As a science whose celebrants feel fortunate enough to claim that
it has met with the occasional if provisional success, logic claims to have
arrived, here and there, now and again, at genuine bits of knowledge as to
how we ought to conduct our thinking if we want to succeed at it.  As you
know, this view is often discovered to be controversial, even among those
who call themselves "pragmatic thinkers".

&gt; (2) our proposition and thus our logic reflect our basic assumptions
&gt;     about the nature of that supposed reality which we are representing
&gt;     by our propositions,

One of the functions of language is to describe the phenomena of experience,
and all of the descriptive sciences depend on its success in this function.
Language has a logical aspect, constituted by the logical forms that are
embodied in it, and so it may seem that these logical forms have a role
in the description of reality.  I guess it depends on what a role is.
But it is also true that the normative function of logic is rather
independent, not "exclusiove of all relationship to", but just
independent, of its descriptive role.
&gt;
&gt; (3) for the most part we assume that reality to be one
&gt;     in which things (variables) are moving about in space-time,

As I scan ahead, I find that the rest of your discussion hinges
rather heavily on this identification of "things" with "variables",
a thing that I do not understand, and I am torn as to how to proceed,
whether to attach your remaining predications to the subject of things
or to the subject of variables, or whether to try and explain, instead,
how I understand the use of "variables", which appears to be the more
problematic concept of the pair.  I think that I will wait and see
how you receive what I have written above and maybe try to tackle
the rest of it the next time.

And please don't ask me about the game!

Cheers, well, cheers for some,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; (4) we call the movement of variables events,
&gt;
&gt; (5) we call the impact or consequence of one event upon another event or
&gt;     variable the 'meaning" of that event with respect to the other variable,
&gt;
&gt; (6) by "impact" or consequence we mean the ways in which the future
&gt;     developmental possibilities of the impacted event or variable
&gt;     are limited.
&gt;
&gt; So to recap a main point  -- we basically assume reality to be comprised of
&gt; variables moving about in space time.  Syntax defines the permissible types
&gt; of moves (given our notion of what constitutes a variable) and semantics refers
&gt; to the consequences of these moves.
&gt;
&gt; I hope all this was not too muddled.
&gt; I present it both as a set up for
&gt; the following but also for review
&gt; on it's own merit.
&gt; 
&gt; My point-question is this:  Are not rules of inference in effect definitions
&gt; of variables.  IOWs a variable is that construct whose meaning is preserved
&gt; when subjected to the following  ROIs or transformations.  So in a sense
&gt; (I'm suggesting-asking) do not ROIs also address the meaning of one
&gt; component of our presumed reality -- namely the nature of variables?
&gt;
&gt; And might not a logic (Russell's for example) run into difficulty when
&gt; it turns out that the presumed nature of a variable (class or whatever)
&gt; turns out to be contradictory under certain ROIs.  Maybe self contradictory
&gt; variables DO exist -- just not on the macro level we are accustomed to working
&gt; with.  Hopefully I have not completely lost my way or simply started off on the
&gt; wrong foot to begin with.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any comments-suggestions you
&gt; have the time or inclination to offer.
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Piat
