JA = Jon Awbrey
JS = Jim Schoening
MW = Matthew West

JA: In answering your questions below, I will shift back
    to the larger arena, and address the properties of all
    FONAI (families of notation and implementation) that take
    as the generators of their ensuing generations the logical
    ligaments that are commonly denoted by means of ligatures like
    {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ...}.  Making up a nonce nomen just
    off the cusp of my head, let us call this soup the &quot;PentAlphaBet&quot;
    (PAB), and from this point on I will focus my critique, no more on
    poor innocent and utterly dependent epigone KIF, but on the much
    larger steaming kettle of PAB from whence this pot of message
    that we call &quot;KIF&quot; was initially dipped and incrementally
    spoon-fed to us.

JA: Furthermore, taking the &quot;whole systems&quot; approach, as the better half
    of my training has always taught me to do, I will not try to disjoin
    the questions of human conceptual and machine computational features
    in my analysis, but contemplate the whole impact of PAB or any FONAI
    on the whole chiasmatic system of &quot;computer-human interaction&quot; (CHI).

MW: I recall this now you mention it, but missed it in my summary
    of what I think you are about below.  I'd like to understand
    better why you think [PAB] is inadequate.  For example is it:

MW: 1.  [PAB] notation is obscure and difficult for humans
        to read and understand (but convenient for computers).

JA: No, not at first, of course.  It is, after all, &quot;quasi modo infantes&quot;,
    intended to be served up as &quot;comfort food&quot;, for the consumption of
    the &quot;artificial infant&quot; (AI) and the natural infant alike, and is
    thus especially well-formulated for those who are just beginning
    to learn, insipiently, to talk and to think in a logical fashion.

JA: But.

JA: I have no way of estimating what your own logical information capacities are,
    and so I will merely confess what I discovered about my own at an early age,
    to wit, that when I tried to wean myself from propositional formulas whose
    complexion was comprised of slightly more than 7 ± 2 boolean variables,
    I found myself already being confused by the diversity of evident and
    evidential truths that fused generically haplessly indistinctly into
    one another in my mind, and inundated my meagre aptitude to test
    their potential bearing on the question in front of my face.

JA: And so I had to turn to the e-mediacy of the e-lecturonic computer,
    much against my will and my heart's inspiration, I can tell you that,
    all in order to help myself out of the very many quandaries wherein
    I was inexorably, inexplicably, inextricably practically continually
    finding myself.  And no, PAB don't cut it one bit for a' that.

In comparing, contrasting, discriminating, and evaluating various languages
we naturally run into the questions of how, indeed, to justify each one and
to judge among them.  Given that the types of languages we are talking about
here are finitely generated artificial instruments, it is evident that there
can be no such thing as &quot;the uniquely perfect linguistic equipment&quot; (TUPLE)
for all intents and purposes that we might conceive to name, nor even for
a fixed purpose and a given season under heaven.  But it is just as clear
that, given a purpose, different languages will serve it better or worse.
And the better that we are able to describe our object and to define our
purpose, the better that we are able to discern among the many available
candidates for the executive, the interpretive, and the legislative forms
of languages and media that might conceivably enable us all to realize it.

An expansive spectrum of evolving inquiry radiates from this single point,
and I can sparely do more than dimly foreshadow a few higher lights of it.

MW: 2.  [PAB] is an asciification of First Order Logic, and FOL
        is inadequate to the task at hand (if so please explain
        why and what is needed).

I have nothing very extraordinary to offer regarding FOL in the abstract.
The method that's in it has its limits, the limits that make it a method.
It has its uses in spite of, or due to, its disciplined reserves of scope.
What matters is only knowing what these limits, scopes, and utilities are.

From my first work in &quot;computer assisted proof&quot; (CAP)
and &quot;propositional equation reasoning systems&quot; (PERS)
I found that it is of critical importance to sort out
the propositional, quantificational, relational facets
of these tasks.  This has led me to look at the series
of &quot;orders&quot;, ZOL, FOL, SOL, TOL -- and there is reason
to believe that one would never need anything more than
these four, if indeed that many, orders or &quot;intens/tions&quot; 
of logic -- in a slightly, okay, maybe radically different
way than the perspectives that you are likely to have gained
wot of.  But that is a long and winding story, for another day.

Jon Awbrey

MW: 3.  [PAB] does not give adequate support
        for semiotics (or some other key theory).

MW: For myself, I don't like KIF, but I think I can live with it.

JA: People learn to live with many things.

But those who do not study the story of Nazi and Soviet and Taliban history
are doomed to repeat it.  It all begins with infinitesimal, incre-mental,
inconspicuous, innocuous, all too e-noxious abuses of power.

JA: The question is whether we can think
    of a better tool for the task at hand.
    I already have.  This is not arrogance.
    The ground was broken, and the groundwork
    laid by Peirce long ago -- Existential Graphs
    and Conceptual Graphs are in the same ballpark --
    I have added a few improvements of my own that
    I happen to like and the utilities of which it
    is my job to demonstrate.  I will do this when
    and if I am ever given half a chance to do so.

JA: We would be far better off just
    writing the standard out in plain
    math/logic monograph style. 

MW: I don't see how this helps interoperability between computer systems.

Transformations Of Discourse.

JA: It is like the development, the initial definition, and the
    eventual formal specification of any programming language,
    say, Lisp or Pascal, just the last ones that I used a lot.
    Wirth's and McCarthy's standards began as plain papers in
    the usual computing science, logic, and mathematical styles.
    McCarthy continued to use his language of M-expressions as
    the definitive source and the medium of communication with
    himself, even when nobody else understood why it was needed,
    over and above the language of compu'terpri'able S-expressions
    that all the world knows as Lisp.  To me this is quite plain.
    He was, and still is, addressing the Ages.

JA: I am definitely not saying that we should not seek a computationally
    implemented language.  Indeed, I would insist that we must at least
    develop the prototype &quot;test of concept&quot;, and usually many of them,
    in order to know if what we specify has a practical realization.
    Indeed, that may be the only useful thing that we can do here --
    and it would put the reductive examples of ontologies that we
    have been cudgeling our brains about in their proper light,
    namely, as little more than &quot;test data structures&quot; for
    the evaluation of the implicit, as yet vaporware,
    ontology maintainance software.  I know the
    &quot;receiver operating characteristocs&quot; of
    many of our prospective user groups,
    and I know that this is exactly how
    they would view our feeble SUO's, as
    just so many &quot;dumb textbook examples&quot;,
    of some use in paidagogy, nothing more.

JA: I am trying to help you with that problem, by delivering a new language
    to you that solves the fundamental problems in a fundamental way.  

MW: So is that the real purpose of your asciified notation?

No, the asciification is in direct response to a request from Chris Menzel.

JA: The basement is dug ...

MW: It being ...?

JA: My whole work in logic, graph theory, formal language theory,
    computer science, sign relational semiotics, systems theory,
    in sum, inquiry driven systems.

MW: You know it would be really handy to see the plans ...

JA: This is a what my dissertation is,
    a portion of which I am presently
    elaborating and expositing on the
    Ontology List.

JA: and the building of the next story is admittedly incomplete,
    but the fundamental medium is planned out right for what is
    probably the first time in history.

MW: But (assuming this is so) at present only in your head.

JA: No, I implemented the basic &quot;test of concept&quot; all through the 80's,
    a Pascal program that is entitled &quot;Theme One&quot;, and that I still use
    today as my main &quot;Propositional Calculator&quot; for any complex problem,
    and submitted it in partial fulfilment of the requirements for my
    Master's in Quantitative Psych at Michigan State University (1989).
    I then adopted this as the ground floor of my current PhD programme
    in Systems Engineering at Oakland University in Michigan, and I have
    been building on that basis with due diligence up until this moment.

JA: And now a few haunting refrains from the overture:

JA: <A  HREF="http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm">http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm</A>

JA: (The advertizing group has requested a #bold statement# for its copy.)

MW: Not the kind of summary of where you are going I had in mind.

JA: &quot;Where no one has gone before ...&quot;

JA: Bold statements make me weary -- I have will have to break here.

JA: Still having trouble getting past this point.

JS: If so, did he formally propose it to them and explain how it fits?
    If not, please explain its contribution.

MW: Jon's paper presents some foundations of logic which he thinks
    are important to set out as the basis for what is to follow.
    This is important, because as you will already have seen,
    logic, and some of the stuff immediately around it,
    is not as cut and dried as we might like to think.
    There are choices to be made, and these should
    be made explicitly.  As you may conclude
    from his exchange with CM, there is
    nothing earth-shattering here.

Well, do we really want to shatter the earth!?

MW: Jon's main contention that this is all leading to is that
    the &quot;big problem&quot; we really face is ontology development,
    rather than a specific ontology, and that we need amongst
    other things to specify and develop tools for this purpose.
    This would support an &quot;enquiry&quot; process which would support
    the interaction between ontology developers to help them
    resolve issues and move forwards.  He correctly identifies
    semiotics (for practical purpose the relationships between
    terms and meanings) as a key element in this.

MW: The main reason I am bothering to mediate here is that I have
    enough experience from my base standards community to know that
    he is right about these things. If we think we are going to create
    anything significant by hand coding KIF files, we don't understand
    the problem, but that is where we are right now.

JS: He is welcome to do his exploring on the Ontology list,
    but it doesn't belong on the SUO list.  If we met in person, 
    he wouldn't be permitted to do about a quarter of the talking
    on these types of topics.

And here I thought that's why we all got with the
Al Gore Rhythm of the Internet in the first place.
