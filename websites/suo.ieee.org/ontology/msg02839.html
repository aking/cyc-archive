All,

	Some good comments below from David Whitten.

	Based on similar comments from many, I agree my proposal below is
too strict and doesn't cover various scenarios.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; All,
&gt; 	It is now clear we need rules for loss of voting rights.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	How does this sound (not a motion):   "If a voting member fails to
&gt; vote (ABSTAIN counts as a vote) in 2 consecutive email ballots, he or she
&gt; will no longer have voting rights (and will be informed as such).
Regaining
&gt; voting rights will be the same as with new members (submit application and
&gt; wait 6-months)."
&gt; 
&gt; 	I do think people should be able to retain voting rights WITHOUT
&gt; being subscribed to the SUO list.  Some may choose to just review
documents,
&gt; a valuable contribution.   As such, ballots will be sent to the addresses
&gt; provided by each voter, plus also to the SUO list.  
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Schoening 
&gt; 

I personally, feel two failures of voting is far too few.  Even if you take
the view that each vote is equivalent to a meeting of an organization,
(which I feel is a doubtful supposition) there should be a more grace in the
organizational structure than forced loss of privileges after not attending
two 'meetings'.
Some people have committments that may preclude active involvement for up a
year, for example, I have a friend who ended up having to probate his
parent's will.  He stopped all e-mail for the entire time, as it involved a
stressful time for him, and much travel.  But after he finished this onerous
task, he came back strong on all his previous involvements.
I think there should be the idea of a leave of absense, whilst the need to
be involved is lessened, but without loss of voting privilege.
I also think we should be clear on what a 'meeting' is, in terms of Robert's
book of Order.
We should also allow for a member to resign, and thereby voluntarily
give up voting privileges immediately. (with possibly a 3 day lemon law
period where they can rescind that resignation, if they come to their
senses) &lt;grin&gt;
You may share anything above this line with the group, at your discretion.
On a different note, I would like to privately ask your advice.  I'd like to
start using the CE list, to discuss the syntax of a subset of English
suitable for describing logic, as I understand is the intent of the list.
My concern is that I would like to have a no-crosspost/no-just-copy policy
on that list, as well as a heavier hand on off-topic discussions.
In your opinion, can we do this, or would it just engender bad feelings
among the group ?
