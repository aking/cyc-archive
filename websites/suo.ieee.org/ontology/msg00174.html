Dear Dietrich,
 
I think you make heavy weather of it.
 
David is clearly meaning that nth-subclass is a member of something he calls
relation. It was not a mistake on his part, but a misunderstanding on mine
of what he meant by relation.

Regards 
      Matthew

Dear Mathew, 
the following was a point, where our previous private message exchange
stopped, 
and where the public dialogue tree branch, as far as I see, also ended as a
leaf, 
to which I now respond a bit late, perhaps running into an open door, 
as we say in German. 

  

&gt; R048: (INSTANCE-OF NTH-SUBCLASS RELATION) 


MW: This seems to suggest that nth-subclass is a member of relation. I think

this is a mistake, nth-subclass should be a subtype of relation. (each 
member of nth-subclass is a member of relation). 


I believe David is correct in this.  Any particular relation is not itself a

set of relations.  'between' does not specify a set of between-ness 
relations, it's just a particular relation.  I'd suggest (as I think David 
does), that if we are to treat relations as first class objects (and I know 
Chris has cautioned us about this so we have to examine the implications of 
this carefully), that we have a relation similar to Cyc's 'genlPreds' which 
allows us to state that a relation is a more specific case of another 
relation.  Avoiding overloading the 'subclass-of' relation for this use is 
important. 


MW1: Perhaps we need to talk about what a relation is. My understanding is 
that a relation is the classification of a tuple, so in EXIST at least this 
is modelled explicitly and would look like: 


[ nth-subclass: &lt;between, 1, TangibleThing&gt;] 


Here nth-subclass is a class, the colon is the "has as member" symbol, and 
the rest is a tuple that is a member of the class. So I would say that any 
structure of this form is a relation, and some of them are nth-subclass 
relations. It may be that you are using relation where I would use the term 
class of relation. 
  
 

I would like to abstain from taking resort to 
the "plurality of meanings" (John Awbrey's famous POMs) 
and think that there is a somewhat more down to earth language trap which 
has caught us or, naturally from my point of view, you, 
because I assume that your frame of reference here is also 
some kind of "FOL- data modeling". 

The bewitchment may also have to do with the informal definition 
of a class as a collection to which we attach some meaning, 
and perhaps the difficulty stems from the example of a relation 
which is a meta-relation in the sense that (with the exception of 
the position argument) has as its arguments a relation and a concept. 
However, our previous dissent was of the same nature. 


Let me first play your language game: 
The mere n-tuples (n &gt; 2) do not have so much meaning, 
therefore we attach some meaning to them, by classifying them 
such as we do with collections of objects (n-tuples with n=1) 
by classifying them e.g. as "red objects". 
So the "classification" of n-tuples (n&gt;=1), according to your view, 
always results in a "class". 
However, I think that you will admit, that it may make sense 
to distinguish, i.e. classify these "classes", e.g. in dichotomic
disjunctive way 
with respect to n=1 and n&gt;1. Then we get two classes, let me call them 
for now "concept" and "relation" or may I also say 
"unary predicate" and "n-ary predicate" with the respective 
subclasses for each n? 
Tautologically, the members of the "classes" 
with n=1 are objects, the instances of the "classes" with n&gt;1 
are objects, which are "genuine" tuples, or - 
departing from the former language game - 
predications / basic assertions, which can be true or false? 
(I do not quarrel about the name of a common superclass 
for both types of classes, and anybody who tried to program 
an automatic classifaction algorithm with respect 
to subclassOf and subrelationOf may have seen, 
that there is much in common to both relations.) 
By that way, the "classes" "concept" and "relation" are such that 
"relation" is instance of "concept", but "relation" is not a subconcept of 
"concept". And now, perhaps you have been already persuaded, 
David's "NTH-SUBCLASS" relation (which is a generalisation 
of what in Cyc is arg1Gnls, arg2Genls, etc., as far as I remember) 
is an instance of "relation". 
If "relation" is your "class of relation", then I would simply say, 
I do not see a motivation for this twisted indirection of naming, 
which unnecessarily may deter your target audience, 
but I see many classes of relations, i.e. "concepts" whose instances 
are relations. 


Maybe, you do not yet aggree, then think about this 
(I try to resume your language game): 
What is the relation between the a classified tuple (a,b) and its "class" R.

Perhaps you call it "isMemberOf". Then, according to your view, 
we have 
R isSubclassOf "class of relation" 
or is it 
R "isMemberOf" "class of relation"? 
And what about the rule, which holds for "concepts": 
((a,b) isMemberOf R) AND (R isSubclassOf "class of relation") ==&gt; 
(a,b) isMemberOf "class of relation" 
or was it (R isMemberOf "class of relation") in the premiss, and 
therefore the conclusion cannot be drawn, 
and you are willing to admit,  that David did it well, or do we have 
to postulate here another kind of "isMemberOf" relationship, 
although/because  it resulted from a "classification" of tuples? 


Regards, 
Dietrich
