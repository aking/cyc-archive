snip
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is perhaps worth remembering that this discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started with Graham saying that activities WERE relations,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where as I was saying that we sometimes represented activities
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as relations, where the relation really contains a
&gt; number of things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the activity is related to, including perhaps a
&gt; reference to itself,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not other representation, which is not quite the same.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But, really, I cannot be responsible for the ways that other
&gt; &gt; &gt; people talk!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW:  No, all we can do (and perhaps should do) is note that
&gt; &gt; some peoples usage is that:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes   a   in the real world
&gt;
&gt; Can you give me a concrete example -- I still cannot think of one.
&gt;
&gt; Here, just to try and speed things up, I can think of an example
&gt; where I was almost tempted to say something just a bit like this.
&gt; Let me remind you of the story that I told about A and B, where
&gt; each of these two "objects" in the real world -- well, alright,
&gt; my imaginary real world, but you know what I mean -- is also
&gt; an "interpreter" of certain signs, and so is associated with
&gt; a sign relation, portions of which I set down as follows,
&gt; under the names "R(A)" and "R(B)", respectively:
&gt;
&gt; | You can start out by imagining that two people, A and B,
&gt; have a language
&gt; | that is restricted to just their own proper names, "A" and
&gt; "B", plus the
&gt; | first and second person pronouns, "I" and "you", which will here be
&gt; | schematized as "i" and "u", respectively.
&gt; |
&gt; | To specify a sign relation one has to give three domains,
&gt; | the Object, Sign, and Interpretant domains, schematized
&gt; | here as O, S, and I, respectively.
&gt; |
&gt; | For this example, let us consider the two sign relations,
&gt; R(A) and R(B),
&gt; | corresponding to the usages of the two "interpreters", A
&gt; and B, respectively.
&gt; |
&gt; | (Notation:  I will use "EUR" for "element of" and "ç" for
&gt; "subset of".)
&gt; |
&gt; | We have the following:
&gt; |
&gt; | R(A), R(B)  ç  O x S x I,
&gt; |
&gt; | O  =  {A, B},
&gt; |
&gt; | S  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"},
&gt; |
&gt; | I  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"}.
&gt; |
&gt; | R(A) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; |
&gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "i"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;A, "i", "A"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;A, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "u"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "u", "B"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; |
&gt; | R(B) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; |
&gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "u"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;A, "u", "A"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;A, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "i"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "i", "B"&gt;
&gt; |   &lt;B, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; |
&gt; | Following a usage of C.S. Peirce, the elements of a sign relation R,
&gt; | that is, the ordered triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; EUR R, are known as
&gt; | its "elementary sign relations".  (This is roughly Peirce's
&gt; meaning.)
&gt; |
&gt; | Refs:
&gt; |
&gt; | <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00729.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00729.html</A>
&gt; | <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg01224.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg01224.html</A>

&gt;
&gt; Now, it is very tempting to just go ahead and identify
&gt; the "objective interpreters" A and B with the portions
&gt; of sign relations that are indicated in an immediately
&gt; relevant context, and thus to write out the identities,
&gt; A = R(A) and B = R(B), or, to write it all out in full:
&gt;
&gt; A  =  {&lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "A", "i"&gt;, &lt;A, "i", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "i", "i"&gt;,
&gt;        &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "B", "u"&gt;, &lt;B, "u", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "u", "u"&gt;}.
&gt;
&gt; B  =  {&lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "A", "u"&gt;, &lt;A, "u", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "u", "u"&gt;,
&gt;        &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "B", "i"&gt;, &lt;B, "i", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "i", "i"&gt;}.
&gt;
&gt; Now, we are treading on recursed ground here, or very nearly,
&gt; apparently defining A and B in terms of themselves, in a way
&gt; that would seem to lead to an infinite regress, so it seems.
&gt; Now, the situation is really not as bad as all that, not if
&gt; one is careful, and qualifies everything with due attention,
&gt; but still, it is probably a good idea to avoid this way of
&gt; expressing things if at all possible.  One way to stay out
&gt; of trouble and confusion is to maintain the distinctions
&gt; between A and R(A) and between B and R(B), respectfully.
&gt; Another way to do it is to "hedge the equal signs" that
&gt; appear just above, stipulating that they do not signify
&gt; literal identities but only mark relationships whereby
&gt; the ostensible definienda A and B are "represented by"
&gt; their "actions" on the surrogate definientia, that is,
&gt; the basic elements {A, B, "A", "B", "i", "u"} that go
&gt; to make up the triples, that go to make up the sets
&gt; of triples, that are the sign relations in question.
&gt;

MW: let me try something "real"

&lt;purchase, Carter's, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August
1999&gt;

This is reasonably typical of what you might find in a purchasing system.
It
might be said to represent a purchasing activity. However, you will note
that there is no single element in this tuple that represents that
activity,
only the class of activity (purchase). Similarly, there is no object that
is
a surrogate for the actual lawnmower purchased (e.g. its serial number),
but
only the type of item bought (lawnmower) and the manufacturers model (Honda
CB250) and even this has the manufacturers name bundled in. Since this is
an
international lawnmower shop, the have unusually given a unit of measure
for
the price paid, and we have the date and time of the purchase. It is highly
likely that there is only one activity that all these elements relate to.
But the question is, does this refer to an activity, or is it just a
relation of elements that are each related to an activity and together
uniquely identify it, but is not a surrogate for the activity itself? I
would argue that it is the latter, but custom and practice means that many
would accept it as the former.


MK&gt;  Isn't it absolutely fundamental to any representation that:
1.  the representation is necessarily incomplete?
2. that being incomplete is very valuable, because it is easier to handle
for particular purposes?
3. that the incompleteness may be extreme, depending on what you judge it
against (e.g. a reconstruction of Matthew walking into a shop with a real
credit card in his hand and wheeling out an actual machine and putting it
in his car)?
To me it follows that if someone with a particular purpose in mind
demonstrates that a particular representation is complete enough for that
purpose, then it is a valid representation for that purpose.  Of course,
someone else with a different purpose in mind may find the same
representation of what he considers to be the same real world activity
deficient.

None of this, of course, should stop us trying to agree what would be a
useful level of detail of representation of activity for inclusion in the
SUO, but there will be no absolute criteria of whether what we agree is
right, only judgement of whether it is enough to useful for what we think
to be the likely uses.
