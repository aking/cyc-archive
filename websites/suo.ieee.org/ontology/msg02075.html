Greetings, Matthew.

&gt; &gt; Also, I'm not sure it's wise to equivocate on "extension" as you do:
&gt; &gt; the extension of an individual for you is (I take it) something like
&gt; &gt; a 4D chunk of space-time, while the extension of a set is the set of
&gt; &gt; its members (i.e., the set itself).
&gt;
&gt; MW: Correct.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Granted, for you, both types of extension are used to individuate
&gt; &gt; objects of the relevant sort, but to avoid confusion perhaps it's
&gt; &gt; better to talk instead about, e.g., the spatio-temporal *extent* or
&gt; &gt; *boundaries* (or the like) of an individual, rather than its
&gt; &gt; extension.
&gt;
&gt; MW: Interestingly, I am also being criticised by others for not
&gt; making more of extension as being a common concept across class
&gt; and individual where whole/part and subtype/supertype can be seen
&gt; as the same.

Well, that is a pretty poor criticism.  Far from being a common concept
across class and individual, class extension and individual extension
are two completely different concepts that just happen to share the same
name.  I think this is rather obvious.  One has to do with chunks of
space-time, the other with sets.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction if I am
&gt; &gt; &gt; not) the key constructs in KIF are: - constants - variables (and
&gt; &gt; &gt; more generally lambda calculus)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nope, there is no variety of lambda calculus in KIF.  (And I am
&gt; &gt; puzzled why you think the lambda calculus is a generalization of the
&gt; &gt; notion of a variable.)
&gt;
&gt; MW: Well I may have misunderstood what Lambda Calculus is about, in
&gt; which case this is a good opportunity to learn my mistake.
&gt;
&gt; I was under the impression that variable expressions like:
&gt;
&gt; (forall ?x (=&gt; (car ?x) (has-wheels ?x)))
&gt;
&gt; were lambda expressions largely because they did involve variables.
&gt; Please explain my error.

The expression above is simply a sentence in a particular first-order
language.  A lambda expression is a property-denoting (or function-, or
relation-denoting, depending on the flavor of lambda calculus)
expression involving an abstraction operator, usually written as a
lambda.  Thus, for example, in the typed lambda calculus, the expression
[lambda x (exists y) Rxy] would denote the property of being something
that bears the relation R to something, or, viewed extensionally, the
set of all things e such that, for some object e', the pair &lt;e,e'&gt; is an
element of the relation R.  (I'm mingling use and mention here a bit,
but never mind.)

&gt; MW: Yes. I know I need that.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; (and, I take it, your quantification theory is first-order).
&gt;
&gt; MW: As I'm sure you know, this is beyond my knowledge. If I assume
&gt; that a quantification theory that is higher order implies a logic that
&gt; is higher order, then my position is as follows. I believe (because
&gt; people like you tell me) that there are significant advantages to
&gt; staying first order.

Or close to it.  There is a proposal before the KIF WG that provides a
semantics for sequence variables that gives KIF a bit more expressive
kick, albeit something quite a bit less than full second-order logic.

&gt; Therefore my preference is to remain first order until it can be
&gt; demonstrated that critical requirements can not be satisfied without
&gt; moving from that. You have said that these situations should not
&gt; occur, or can be overcome, and I will buy that until the contrary is
&gt; proved.  (see how trusting I am!)

Or naive! :-)  Overall, yes, there seems little need to go beyond
first-order, though the additional expressive power that sequence
variables give to KIF comes in very handy for certain things.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  - predication is used for set membership.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You mean you model predication in terms of set membership in the
&gt; &gt; usual way?  Ok.
&gt;
&gt; MW: Yes, but I think in general a predicate is used as a property,

In my idiolect (not shared by all, especially John Sowa -- hi John!),
this makes no sense.  A predicate is a linguistic thingy, a property is
a semantic (or ontological) thingy that can be expressed by a predicate.
But in any case, I'm not sure what it means to "use" anything "as a
property."

&gt; where this can be true at one time, and not at another. I do not need
&gt; this, since 4D takes time into account already.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  - how one individual stands to another is modelled by relation
&gt; &gt; &gt;  instances
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You mean you model one thing x standing in relation R to another
&gt; &gt; thing y by including the pair &lt;x,y&gt; in the set that represents (or,
&gt; &gt; is identical with) R (again, in the usual way)?  Ok.
&gt;
&gt; MW: I said individual, you said thing. I meant only individuals, sp
&gt; not classes/sets. (but see below).

But if classes/sets are in the domain of quantification, then they can
stand in relations to other things, individuals or not.  So I think you
want to use the more general term "thing" here.

&gt; &gt; &gt;    note: only binary relations are used.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems bizarre to me to limit oneself in principle to binary
&gt; &gt; relations.
&gt;
&gt; MW: I do not set it as a restriction, it is onloy an observation.

Of what?

&gt; &gt; Giving, for example, is a very natural 3-place relation.
&gt;
&gt; MW: Giving is an activity, an activity is a spatio-temporal extent, so
&gt; an individual, so represented by a constant, not a relation. This is
&gt; part of the consisttency I was talking about.

No, I think you are confusing giving with an instance of giving.
Granted, an instance of giving is an activity.  But giving is an
abstract relation -- the relation that three things a, b, and c stand in
when a gives b to c.  You distinguish between, say, the redness of this
apple (i.e., an instance of redness) and redness per se, don't you?
Same distinction applies with giving, don't you think?

&gt; &gt; &gt;    This is principally to minimise structural constraints where
&gt; &gt; &gt;    all places in a relation must be filled, when some are not
&gt; &gt; &gt;    known.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This makes no sense to me whatever.
&gt;
&gt; MW: This is about data modelling issues, not logic issues, and if it
&gt; doesn't make sense, can be safely ignored (unless you design
&gt; databases).

Ok.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  - lambda calculus is used for defining constraints.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are two major varieties of lambda calculus -- typed and
&gt; &gt; untyped -- and I don't see that either is needed, or even usable,
&gt; &gt; for ontology.
&gt;
&gt; MW: I may misunderstand what Lambda Calculus is about...

You do.  Or you did.  :-)

&gt; &gt; The typed lambda calculus is basically just omega-order logic
&gt;
&gt; MW: Omega-order logic? You lost me.

Well, there's second-order logic, in which there are quantifiers range
over properties (or set) of individuals (among other things),
third-order logic in which there are quantifiers that range over
properties of properties of individuals (among other things), and so on.
Omega-order logic has quantifiers that range over all the things that
all the nth-order logics range over, for all n.

&gt; &gt; (i.e., roughly, there are in its intended semantics objects of every
&gt; &gt; finite order, and, in its language, variables that range over each
&gt; &gt; order),
&gt;
&gt; MW: You definitely lost me!

Does the above help?

&gt; (aside: did you hear about the baseball pitcher who complained to his
&gt; interviewer that the problem he had with the press was that they
&gt; printed what he said, not what he meant?)

Yeah, I hate it when that happens!

&gt; &gt; The untyped lambda calculus (developed in by Church and Kleene in
&gt; &gt; the 30s) is an approach to computability theory (though, notably,
&gt; &gt; has also been used more recently in the semantics of natural
&gt; &gt; language as the basis of a theory of properties and relations).  The
&gt; &gt; untyped calculus, while powerful and flexible, is also
&gt; &gt; mathematically very complex, and I haven't seen anything in ontology
&gt; &gt; that requires it.  Perhaps if you said what a "constraint" is.  Are
&gt; &gt; you simply talking about the ability to define a class or relation
&gt; &gt; by means of some condition like "x is red and x is an apple"?  That
&gt; &gt; only requires a reasonable class theory.
&gt;
&gt; MW: That's about it. I thought that using variables at all implied
&gt; Lambda Calculus.

Which, I take it, you now no longer think!

&gt; When I say something strange about logic, don't look
&gt; for anything complicated or deep when ignorance will provide an
&gt; adequate explanation.

*laugh*  Your humility is refreshing, especially in this forum!

&gt; &gt; &gt; note: relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are only
&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed when the nature of the constraint they define is defined
&gt; &gt; &gt; by a lambda expression.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Relations don't define anything; they are just (for you) sets of
&gt; &gt; ordered pairs.  And it is looking more and more like a constraint is
&gt; &gt; just a condition like the one above.  I think you should leave
&gt; &gt; "lambda" out of it!
&gt;
&gt; MW: fine, (its all Greek to me!?) but what should I have said?

Well, I'm not sure I understand what you were trying to say well enough.
Perhaps simply that all relations between classes have to be definable
by some first-order condition?

Regards,

-chris
