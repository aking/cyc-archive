&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;Maybe I should have been clearer.
&gt;
&gt;"&gt;The relational database view is that they are a different kind of tuple -
&gt; &gt;where, somehow the tuple also carries content.
&gt;
&gt;Wait a minute. You think that a triple of actual things (people and
&gt;messages, say) doesnt carry content? How much more concrete could
&gt;content get than actually being some pieces of the world? Its like
&gt;pointing to the actual thing instead of describing it."
&gt;
&gt;The point is that in a relational database view the relations have content
&gt;over and above the elements of the triple.

OK, thats (really) what I  thought you probably meant. I would say 
that this view of relation is simply the result of giving an 
extensional relation a label, ie thinking of it as a *named* set of 
n-tuples, where the name is part of what makes it what it is. It's 
easy to adapt logical semantics to do that, of course: in fact, it 
makes the logic easier, since it is now trivial to decide whether or 
not two relations are the same: they are iff they have the same name, 
and that's all there is to it. In other words, the entire theory for 
equality between relations amounts to the axiom (forall (?r) (= ?r 
?r)).

&gt;So, for example, let's say X is
&gt;both an uncle of Y and the godfather of Y. Then there would be two
&gt;individual relations (two different tables with two different rows), (X
&gt;uncle, Y nephew) and (X godfather, Y godson). Whereas the logical view would
&gt;have &lt;X, Y&gt; as a couple belonging to two relation classes - Uncle of and
&gt;Godfather of.

I really do not quite see the distinction here. In both cases the 
pair &lt;X,Y&gt; occurs inside two 'things' (tables or sets) which each 
have a name. Is the fact that the columns also have names 
significant? If so, then each of your tables is actually three 
logical things: a relation and two 'selection' functions. If you make 
these all explicit in the logic then you get the same distinctions 
and expressive power.

&gt;If you look at the way relations are used in
&gt;Entity-Attribute-Relation modeling, then it is clear that people do not
&gt;think

Sorry, I cant let that go by. NOTHING about what 'people really 
think' is clear.  People can think in all kinds of ways.

&gt;that the individual relation's identity is given by the elements (and
&gt;so does not behave like a couple (tuple). The 'nature' of the relation is
&gt;included in the    particular relation - as it is also, for example in
&gt;medieval logic and modern trope theory.

Yes, I know about modern trope theory. But we arent doing trope 
theory, we are doing ontology. If someone wants to have tropes in 
their ontology then let them axiomatise tropes in the same (modern) 
logic that everyone else is using.

&gt;"&gt;If we swap positions in a tuple e.g. &lt;A, Bill, B&gt; to &lt;B, A, Bill&gt; we
&gt; &gt;do. Similarly while in logic a tuple can belong to a number of relation
&gt; &gt;classes, it is not clear that this is so for the relational view.
&gt;
&gt;So two things can only have one relation in a RDB ?"
&gt;
&gt;It is more that each relation in a RDB is of one type.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe Robert A Meersman reference will make all this clearer.
&gt;""### Perhaps this particular discussion should be carried on after
&gt;everybody has had a chance to read the absolutely seminal paper "Towards a
&gt;Logical Reconstruction of Relational Database Theory" by pur sang AI person
Ray Reiter already in 1978. ....

Yes, I agree that Ray's paper is an excellent source of clarity and 
precision, as indeed are most of his writings.
