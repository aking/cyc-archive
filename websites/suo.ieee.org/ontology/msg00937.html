&gt;
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; BTW, to elaborate on another message I sent in reply to Niles, many
&gt; &gt; of these categorizations derive from natural language usage. NL
&gt; &gt; structures (case distinctions, the verb/noun distinction, and such
&gt; &gt; things as temporal aspect) often do suggest exactly this kind of
&gt; &gt; distinction, and have motivated much of the relevant philsophical
&gt; &gt; work that underpins it (such as the absurd doctrine that all
&gt; &gt; occurrents can only be individuated by a connecting continuant.) But
&gt; &gt; it is vitally important to bear in mind that NL is NOT an ontology
&gt; &gt; language. It evolved for human communication in real time, between
&gt; &gt; creatures living in a 'present'. It is a fundamentally tensed,
&gt; &gt; indexical language used for highly context-dependent  communication
&gt; &gt; betwseen intelligent agents about an essentially 3-d world. Our
&gt; &gt; ontologies, to be any use at all, need to stay true throughout time;
&gt; &gt; they are not in a tensed or indexical langauge; they cannot rely on
&gt; &gt; the intelligence or quick-wittedness of the reader,  and they are
&gt; &gt; being used largely to support reasoning, not to communicate immediate
&gt; &gt; facts about the local circumstances of a speech act. This is
&gt; &gt; basically why linguistic intutions do more harm than good in
&gt; &gt; practical ontology design.
&gt; &gt; In any case, I would add, more up-to-date empirical work on languages
&gt; &gt; has often shown that the categorisations of earlier analyses are
&gt; &gt; simplistic. English nominalisation, in particular, almost destroys
&gt; &gt; the noun/verb distinction in practice.
&gt;
&gt;Would you elaborate still further on this topic?

Well, I'd like to write a book about it, but right now I don't have time.

&gt;From your viewpoint, can NL
&gt;structures provide any practical or theoretical support for logical and
&gt;ontological structures?

Yes and no. It depends what you expect the ontology to do. If it is 
basically , or in part, to encode information for humans to use in a 
machine-readable and extractable form - a kind of super-library - 
then YES, it would be very useful to follow linguistic conventions as 
far as possible. If on the other hand it is considered primarily to 
support machine inference (and planning, etc.) processes, with 
minimal human intervention - the traditional AI goal and that behind 
CYC, for example - then I'd say NO, or at any rate I think that it is 
a serious and babsic mistake, in this case, to *rely* on linguistic 
clues to give a suitable inferential scaffolding.

Of course the issue is never this clear-cut, since for example even 
in the most extreme versions of case 2, humans do have to actually 
write and debug the axioms, etc. .  The issue then I think is the 
extent to which one can expect this business of axiom-writing to be 
being done by specialists and be a rather technical business 
requiring some training, dedicated long-term effort and expertise (as 
in CYC) , or whether one expects that the ontology will somehow be 
easy to read and 'natural', comprehensible to the lay reader, etc., 
the kind of thing that any bunch of reasonably smart folk ought to be 
able to put together by dictating their thoughts for a few years.

My basic grumble is that there seems to be a widespread assumption 
that it is just kind of obvious that linguistic data is relevant to 
ontology design. I think that for an inference-supporting ontology 
this view is extremely naive, based on very daft assumptions (such as 
the idea the people think in natural language) and more likely to 
cause trouble than to be of use, in practice. The 
occurrent/continuant distinction is a lovely example of the kind of 
hole one is led into.

&gt;What are the implications for a natural language
&gt;correlate to SUO-KIF logical expressions?

It is, in general, extremely hard to do: an open research problem in 
AI, and not one that is going to be solved in the near future.

&gt;Does this offer advice for the SUO
&gt;structural ontology?

See above.

&gt;Is this related to the "Plain English" movement (the
&gt;evils of nominalization, etc. ;^)?

I don't know anything about that. It sounds loony: most movements to 
re-design natural languages are. It's like trying to pass laws to 
stop the tide.
