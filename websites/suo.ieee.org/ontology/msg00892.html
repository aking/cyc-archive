John,

	Point taken.  We're still assuming too much philosophical and
SUO-specific background in the docu-strings, and there aren't nearly enough
examples to illustrate the meaning of the concepts.  I'll work on this as
time permits.

Thanks,
Ian

&gt; Subject: SUO: More Documentation, Please
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In a message today, Ian Niles includes many of his 
&gt; documentation strings, such as:
&gt; ---------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is any entity whose 
&gt; &gt; parts are wholly
&gt; &gt; &gt;present whenever it is present.")
&gt; ----------------------
&gt; 
&gt; And later in the same message he writes:
&gt; ---------------------
&gt; These docu-strings are supposed to make the meaning
&gt; of the concepts clear to people who weren't involved in 
&gt; constructing the
&gt; ontology.
&gt; ----------------------
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with the stated goal, but I offer all of our current 
&gt; documentation strings as evidence that we are nowhere near that goal.
&gt; 
&gt; To pick on this one example, a "man on the street" (and most 
&gt; of us) would have no idea of what a Continuant is based on 
&gt; this definition.  Let's see, ...an entity whose parts are 
&gt; wholly present whenever it is present.  I first strain to 
&gt; think of anything that doesn't fit this category.  Well, 
&gt; maybe it means something that's not missing any of its parts, 
&gt; so a car that's missing its back seat would not be a 
&gt; Continuant (?).  But what does "wholly present" mean?  Does 
&gt; it mean the parts are correctly assembled and not just lying 
&gt; in a pile?  If my car's back set is sitting on the ground 
&gt; beside it, is it wholly present?  If it's in the same garage, 
&gt; or the same city, or the same state, is it wholly present?   
&gt; How close does it have to be to be present?
&gt; 
&gt; It turns out that the author is apparently not using the word 
&gt; "parts" in any normal sense, but probably means it to refer 
&gt; to temporal parts (a completely foreign usage to anyone but 
&gt; us).  Or does it also refer to physical parts at the same 
&gt; time?  If a set is an entity, do members of a set count as 
&gt; its parts, and how can we tell whether they are "present" or 
&gt; not, or whether the set itself is present?  These are the 
&gt; sorts of questions anyone might have when reading this definition.
&gt; 
&gt; My recommendation is that we should focus on getting rich 
&gt; definitions written for these concepts, so that we can all 
&gt; understand them before we go any further.  The definitions 
&gt; should include all the explanatory text we can create, 
&gt; including discussions of where the boundaries of each concept 
&gt; are (i.e., what barely fits this definition, and what just 
&gt; misses?).  There should be plenty of examples of the full 
&gt; range of entities that fit the category, and of some that 
&gt; don't, and why not.  Perhaps we want a second relation like 
&gt; "discussion" where all the issues and subtle problems with 
&gt; each concept are stored.  
&gt; 
&gt; Take a look at some of the longer definitions in the Cyc 
&gt; upper ontology for examples of the minimal amount of 
&gt; documentation we should strive for.  Also, it would be good 
&gt; for our documentation to point to the equivalent (or closest) 
&gt; concept in Cyc (and anyone else's public ontology), so that 
&gt; we might have a better chance to understand what the author 
&gt; is trying to say.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, I'm becoming slightly more optimistic that this 
&gt; effort might someday produce something, now that Pat Hayes 
&gt; and others are tackling the errors and confusions in the 
&gt; "merged ontology" file.  Thanks to Ian Niles for getting this 
&gt; ball rolling.
