I have decided to see if it  is possible to have some empiric feedback
about a specific ontology in a (partially) international context directly
from  users, in a simplified  but "real life" context, particularly from the
point of view of learning, cognition and meaning creation.

The idea is to  accumulated  experiences, in front of a common corpus of
knowledge, and results that  can be reproduced, in order to share results
and not opinions (sometimes expressed in papers).

In fact I have some  experience of territory planning enough to know that in
front of a similar (GIS) ontology and similar data people make often makes
different judgements. But perhaps governance is one of the most complicated
human tasks.

And I know from my past experience that in a corporation  (where many
conceptualization about the world are shared) is more easy to create a
common ontology  and a to define a participated agenda (for instance in the
old Digital Equipment a method -so called - "Top Mapping", inspired by
Edgar Schein works about process consulting, have been used to address this
kind of problems).

So I have decided to see if it  where possible to have some empiric feedback
about a specific ontology in a (partially) international context directly
from  users, in a simplified  but "real life" context, particularly from the
point of view of learning, cognition and meaning creation.


So please find here the description of  two (small, tentative and rude) case
about ontology sharing and meaning relationship related to the only two
simplified social context I could find. Two courses of mine at Pavia's
University.

But  I hope that  similar (more serious) experiments could be created in
corporations and  in other communities to support with a practice of
feedback  the SUO definition process and Suo knowledge and common practice
diffusion process.


Case 1. The ontology approach to real understanding and measure of reality
appears to be appealing, (at least)  to learned users. Context knowledge
seems more easy to conceptualize that a superior ontology (that in this case
could not be identified).

I've proposed  few and  very simplified upper ontology examples,  taken from
Brentano, Cyc, GIS (from Sowa books) and from  a recent GianPiero Zarri
(CNRS)  work (Intelligent database systems - Zarri and others Addison-Wesley
2001)  to a group of 27 selected graduated (with a bachelor in some kind of
human science and  with strong knowledge in technology) students (mostly
Italians but with few students from South America and actually one from
Russia)  in a short  (45 hours)  course  of mine ( New Economy: media  &amp;
technology in Media Science and New Technology  International Master in
Pavia <A  HREF="http://media.iuss.unipv.it">http://media.iuss.unipv.it</A>), asking them to define an ontology
suitable to express a business model in a given context they knew.

I've proposed also GianPiero's "conversational" approach (that is based on
such a basic concepts as SORTAL -  an economic entity or a
human_being_or_soc.body - and NON_SORTAL_CONCEPTS - where a
characterizing_concept is a color for instance) because the taxonomy
appeared  to be (to me at least) not too far to some (simple) KM commercial
solution available on the market (as Livelink from open text that the
students knew) and suitable for a course on economics and technology.

All the students declared to like this ontology oriented business analysis
exercise very much but they produced only very rude (agent-patient-context)
ontologies about the various business, and   they, apparently,  did not pay
to much attention to the superior upper ontology problem. There was no time
to get into the details, but also this case seems to suggest  that context
knowledge comes first of the need to define a standard superior ontology.

Case 2. A standard ontology  helps meaning creation

I've decided to use a more precise approach in a second short course (a 30
hours -experimental and cross- disciplinary with 15 people ranging from
first year undergraduate - and from engineering to fine arts to graduated
master students) about communication and arts (Rate &amp; Tekken for Pave
University)  to understand the relationship between ontology and meaning
creation, using a very simple GIs-like and visual ontology.

  In fact  Washy Kandisky's 1923 conceptualization  ( Punkt und Linie zu
Flaeche)  Point,  Line surface,, and Peirce's semiotic
conceptualizations,from Sowa book,  may be easily used to create link
Art-ontology  with technologies.

The students where asked to produce a creation using simple multimedia tools
(available on common PC) out of a basic sign ontology.

To help them in this creation process   I've asked to few friend artists
that work  in Kandisky line of artistic researches (that has produced the
famous "cut on canvas" from Lucio Fontana for instance)  to provide
elements to the students  about  basic signs  creation (Italian maestro
Agostino Ferrari), and about  space and context creation  (Japanese Oky
Izumi). This because of this artists experiences in a world-wide context (
between west and Asia). Oki Izumi is an artist that work only with geometric
solid shapes made of slices of glass. She produces the things of art more
close to math and geometry  that I ever seen.  And a live example of  free
meaning creation from a very basic and simplified ontology. (To complete the
scene with sounds a composer  has covered the musical basic semiotic which
was about signs, sounds  &amp; spaces and technology).

This line of  (conceptual) mostly visual  artistic researches looks for
"natural" components of meaning creation, as well as to cross-culture to
produce  universal meanings.

As expected  this time (in 2 instance by now) the proposed visual basic
ontology  have been used by the student to create  a multimedia application
that  was personal and new but that at the same time appeared to be based on
standard  (Icon) group of signs and appreciated  and understood  by the
audience. (At the end of next month all the people will present the final
work so I'll have the final results).

On the other hand, by now we have learned that while a glass cube is a glass
cube, for the Japanese world  the meaning of a cube in a context may be
different than  for a western world .  This for historically different
"cultural"  reasons. In fact the  Japanese  traditional  art  is
BI-dimensional.

Also this case seems to confirm that meaning  arise from (abduction about)
contingent physical, natural and cultural ambits.

These case of course are very far from being accurate (and somebody could
argue that these aren't even tests).

But  making experiments   may be another possible way to create a
distributed network of learned communities  interested in sorting out a
shared ontology as a communication common assets by means of results in
context that can be reproduced,  perhaps using a first  basic proposal from
a small community of experts interested in supporting real life
applications.



 Best wishes.

Subject: SUO: Merged Ontology Update


&gt;
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I just wanted to give everyone an update on the Merged Ontology.
&gt; In line with the suggestion from many sources that we should be guided
from
&gt; below rather than above in our ontological engineering, I've stripped down
&gt; the top level once again.  I've tried to eliminate all concepts that are
not
&gt; necessary to support any of the content of the middle-level ontologies
that
&gt; have been incorporated thus far.  The resulting high-level structure can
be
&gt; summarized as follows (where the indentations indicate subclass-of
&gt; relations).
&gt;
&gt; Entity
&gt; Physical
&gt; Object
&gt; Process
&gt; Relation
&gt; Abstract
&gt; Set
&gt; Proposition
&gt; Quantity
&gt; Attribute
&gt;
&gt; I invite everyone to examine these concepts and the ones subsumed by them
in
&gt; our ontology browser (<A  HREF="http://ontology.teknowledge.com/rsigma/">http://ontology.teknowledge.com/rsigma/</A>).
&gt;
&gt; Aside from paring down the high-level structure of the Merged Ontology,
I've
&gt; added and revised many of the docu-strings in the ontology, formulated
many
&gt; new axioms, and tried to achieve a tighter integration of all of the
content
&gt; in the ontology.  One area that still needs further integration is
&gt; mereotopology.  Currently, definitions and axioms are scattered in three
&gt; different sections of the ontology:  the mereotopology proper, the section
&gt; on holes based on Varzi and Casati's work, and the section on Positions
&gt; (everything in this section is a subrelation-of the BinaryRelation
&gt; position).  I welcome any criticisms of or comments on anything in the
&gt; current version of the Merged Ontology.
&gt;
&gt; -Ian
&gt;
