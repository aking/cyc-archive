&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;	Please see my comments below.  Once again, for brevity, I've done
&gt;some editing.

Me too.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The situation calculus is hopelessly limited for a general physical
&gt; &gt; ontology. A process ontology would be a more generally useful overall
&gt; &gt; framework. There are a number of quite elaborate process ontologies
&gt; &gt; in the public domain, any of which would be better than the sitcalc.
&gt; &gt; At a minimum, we need notions of process and subprocesss;
&gt; &gt; combinations of processes into larger processes including temporal
&gt; &gt; sequencing, conditions, parallel operations and ideas like a process
&gt; &gt; which 'spawns' other processes. We need to be able to reason both
&gt; &gt; forwards and backwards in time in a uniform framework, and we need to
&gt; &gt; be able to talk about constraints on processes (and classes of
&gt; &gt; processes) in terms of temporal and spatial constraints at the
&gt; &gt; boundaries, things and materials involved in the processes (either
&gt; &gt; being changed by them or required for them), and things conserved by
&gt; &gt; the process.
&gt;
&gt;OK, any pointers to process ontologies that you can recommend would be
&gt;greatly appreciated.

Google [process+ontology] gets about 41,000, on the first page:

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical Object
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Contains axioms and relations that apply to all individuals
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is a distribution of matter, energy, or both.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This would correspond to 'Object' in the merged ontology,
&gt; &gt; which is a direct
&gt; &gt; &gt;subclass of 'Physical'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think that merged-ont'Object' would be too restrictive. For
&gt; &gt; example, 'the pope from 1400 to 1700' could be a (single)
&gt; &gt; PhysicalObject, but it would have to be a lot of distinct m-oObjects.
&gt;
&gt;The pope from 1400 to 1700 would be a single physical object?

No, a single PhysicalObject. That is, this is a broader concept than 
the normal physical object concept, but it is useful precisely 
because it shares a significant number of properties with that 
ordinary notion: uninterrupted physical existence, instantaneous 
identity with a physical object at all times, a coherent 
spatiotemporal boundary, and so on. Physical objects in the usual 
sense are a distinctive subclass with one extra condition of complete 
spatiotemporal continuity at all points during their lifetime, while 
the general class of things is allowed spatial discontinuity at a 
finite (?) number of timepoints.

&gt; Maybe
&gt;philosophers like to speak this way, but I think it flies in the face of
&gt;common usage and common sense.

To hell with common usage. We are, as I keep emphasising, not doing 
linguistic analysis here. As for common sense, I think in fact that 
this notion is widely used in our everyday thinking and is one that 
all adults are quite competent with. The idea of the continuity of 
the presidency, for example, is quite a normal idea. At the moment 
Kennedy died, LBJ became the President. Apparently even he wasnt 
aware of it at the moment, for it was not because *he* did anything, 
but because it is of the nature *of the presidency* that it be 
temporally continuous, just like a 'continuant'.

&gt;I would say that your "object" is either a
&gt;series of physical objects (namely, the people who occupied this role in
&gt;this time frame)

Yes, you could put it this way; but it is a very special kind of 
series of physical objects, is the point, and we can smoothly 
transfer physical-object talk to this broader category for very good 
ontological reasons, so it is a useful category.

You know, one of the lessons you learn doing this stuff is to allow 
your imagination to wander beyond where your purely linguistic 
intuition thinks it ought to go. Most of what I know couldnt even be 
phrased in English words. One of the reasons that I am resisting your 
methodology so strongly is that I am damned if I want my imagination 
to be forced into the narrow and confining straightjacket of 
ordinary-language philosophy.  I know that I couldnt even think about 
carpentery or painting or swimming or clock repair in those terms, 
let alone engineering.

&gt;or it's the temporally qualified role between a person and
&gt;the Catholic Church.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Functional Physical Object
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Contains axioms and relations that apply to all physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objects that have functional, but need not have material
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuity, e.g. the Chairman of Shell.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm somewhat confused by your example.  It seems to me that
&gt; &gt; the concept
&gt; &gt; &gt;"Chairman of Shell" can be understood in two different ways,
&gt; &gt; either as the
&gt; &gt; &gt;class of all people who have assumed this role or as the person who
&gt; &gt; &gt;currently holds this title.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think neither of these is intended. The point is that the
&gt; &gt; chairmanship (like the US presidency, various categories of royalty,
&gt; &gt; etc.) is temporally continuous and always identified with a single
&gt; &gt; person at a time. It cannot be identified either with a person or
&gt; &gt; with a set. It is a distinct category with its own rules (as in 'the
&gt; &gt; king is dead: long live the king!') Restricting yourself to people
&gt; &gt; and sets is too limiting: there are more kinds of thing in the world
&gt; &gt; than just those two.
&gt;
&gt;I disagree that "Chairman of Shell" is a distinct category.

Well the so much the worse for your limited ontological imagination, 
I would say. I think it is a perfectly reasonable entity, and so 
would the Shell corporation, and so would most lawyers, and so does 
the linguistic evidence, if you find that persuasive: have you 
noticed that this is a *singular* noun phrase?

&gt;I would say
&gt;that it's a binary relation between a person and the Shell Corporation.

The chairman of Shell has a unique location, a weight in pounds and a 
mother and father, at any moment in time. Those don't seem the kind 
of things that a binary relation is likely to have.

&gt;If
&gt;we're interpreting relations extensionally, then it's ultimately a set of
&gt;2-tuples.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stream
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Contains axioms and relations that apply to all physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objects that is material or energy moving along a path, e.g.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a traffic stream flowing on the freeway, some liquid flowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a pipe.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This is a definite gap in the merged ontology, and I would
&gt; &gt; welcome any
&gt; &gt; &gt;contributions towards filling it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, I did discuss an ontology of liquids a few years ago at some
&gt; &gt; length, using a 4-d ontology and focussing on boundary conditions.
&gt; &gt; There is also a fairly detailed set of axioms in CYC.
&gt;
&gt;If you have a write-up of the ontology of liquids, could you pass it my way?

I am trying to get all my old papers scanned into e-readable form 
right now, I'll send it when I can.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I disagree. There is nothing in the notion of 'event' which requires
&gt; &gt; the event to be a discreteProcess. Continuously changing events may
&gt; &gt; also have beginning and ending states.
&gt;
&gt;Can you give me an example of something you would regard as a continuously
&gt;changing event?

A beautiful girl strolling along Thameside, her long black hair 
blowing in the light, gusty summer breeze as she watches the moving 
reflections of the summer clouds in the gently flowing waters of the 
grey river, listening to the sounds of the Greenwich ferry as its 
propellers churn the water into a white foam which, streaming behind 
the moving vessel, spreads into a thin stain on the surface, becoming 
imperceptibly evanescent and finally vanishing.  (Will that do, or 
shall I go on? )

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Collection
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Contains axioms and relations that apply to all things that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have members.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;These axioms and relations are covered in the new,
&gt; &gt; provisional section "Set
&gt; &gt; &gt;Theory" of the merged ontology.  I say "provisional", because SUO
&gt; &gt; &gt;participants haven't seen this stuff before, and it is subject to
&gt; &gt; &gt;revision/rejection.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But not all collections are sets, as has been recently
&gt; &gt; extensively discussed.
&gt;
&gt;It depends on your definitions of these terms, as has also been recently
&gt;extensively discussed.

I think that everyone agrees that collections are not sets. Some 
think that collections are mereosums, however.

&gt;In the merged ontology, there is currently no notion
&gt;of collection (on your usage of the term), but this is something that will
&gt;have to be included at some point.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Contains axioms and relations that apply to all collections
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to which we attach significance.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;In other words, by "Class" you mean a set that forms a natural kind?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ian, what do YOU mean by 'natural kind'? Do you expect that there
&gt; &gt; will ever be a logical definiton of this concept?
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by "logical definition", and let's disabuse
&gt;ourselves right now of the notion that philosophically enlightened
&gt;scientists and other respectable members of society use a concept only when
&gt;they can provide a "logical definition".  Theoretically grounded and
&gt;practically indispensable concepts like gravity, utterance, organism, etc.
&gt;don't have associated with them necessary and sufficient conditions framed
&gt;in terms of conceptual primitives.

No, but they do have quite elaborate explanatory theories which might 
one day be formalizable. I have waxed eloquent myself on the 
impossibility of giving necessary-and-sufficient definitions; of 
course I didnt mean that. I meant, do you expect that one might begin 
to be able to formalize (axiomatize in a formal ontology)  the notion 
of 'natural kind'?

&gt; Although I can't give you a "logical
&gt;definition" of 'natural kind', I think I can explain what I mean by this
&gt;term.  It covers sets of things that we (as a culture) regard as belonging
&gt;together.

Oh, surely you can do better than that. Mothers and babies belong 
together, but that hardly makes them a natural kind. Hands and 
fingers belong together, but.... And so on.

Look. You, like many people who use this awful term, seem to imbue it 
with almost a mystical importance; a kind of basic organizing 
principle for ontology design: classes should be Natural Kinds. Ive 
heard this so many times Im getting sick of it, since it never 
actually seems to be cashed out in anything but the vaguest terms; so 
vague that I suspect it actually has no real meaning, like Organic 
Food. If it is so centrally important, let's see something (in 
English or logic, but *something* nontrivial) about what it is 
supposed to actually mean. ("As a culture" , indeed! I refrain from 
further scorn, but this reaches a new low.)

&gt; &gt; &gt;One idea that strikes me is that we could make 'Class' a
&gt; &gt; direct subclass of
&gt; &gt; &gt;'Set'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately this is exactly the opposite usage from that used
&gt; &gt; throughout mathematics, where every set is a class but not vice
&gt; &gt; versa. (Using a different sense of 'class', however.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This would allow us to apply all of the set-theoretic
&gt; &gt; &gt;definitions/axioms to classes, as well as sets.  This isn't
&gt; &gt; the way things
&gt; &gt; &gt;are currently structured in the ontology (currently, 'Set'
&gt; &gt; and 'Class' are
&gt; &gt; &gt;disjoint siblings of the parent class 'SetOrClass'), but it may be a
&gt; &gt; &gt;convenient way of reusing the set-theoretic apparatus in the
&gt; &gt; context of
&gt; &gt; &gt;intensional classes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What do you mean by an 'intensional class' ? Sets are extensional by
&gt; &gt; definition.
&gt;
&gt;Right, sets themselves are extensional.  But one could think of classes as
&gt;being sets that are associated with a conjunction of properties, viz. the
&gt;properties which are required for membership in the set.

Well, Im currently in trouble with many people for having this view, 
but to me a property IS a set, in effect, so this seems circular to 
me. Since it doesnt seem so to you, I infer that you must have a 
non-extensional notion of what a property is. Since the SUO is likely 
to be expressed in a formal logic with something very like an 
extensional semantics (if not *exactly* extensional), can you say 
what you think a property is, and how you propose to describe it in 
KIF?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Quantifiable Property
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Contains axioms and relations that apply to all Class of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individual that can be mapped to a number and unit of measure.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This is covered in the section "Quantities and Units of
&gt; &gt; Measure" in the
&gt; &gt; &gt;merged ontology.  The key concept in the section is the function
&gt; &gt; &gt;'MeasureFn', which is defined as follows:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(instance-of MeasureFn BinaryFunction)
&gt; &gt; &gt;(nth-domain MeasureFn 1 RealNumber)
&gt; &gt; &gt;(nth-domain MeasureFn 2 Unit-Of-Measure)
&gt; &gt; &gt;(range MeasureFn Measure)
&gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation MeasureFn "This function maps a real number
&gt; &gt; and a unit of
&gt; &gt; &gt;measure
&gt; &gt; &gt;to that number of units.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not all measures can be multiplied by real numbers, so this will need
&gt; &gt; to be modified to be fully general. Also, what is a 'unit-of-measure'
&gt; &gt; ? There seems to be something wrong with this definition. If the
&gt; &gt; unit-of-measure defines the 'units' involved, then we do not also
&gt; &gt; need to have a special measure function to tell us what we are
&gt; &gt; measuring. So for example if we multiply one INCH by three we get
&gt; &gt; three INCHES automatically. All we need is the unit and normal
&gt; &gt; multiplication.
&gt;
&gt;Well, this is a nonstandard application of the multiplication operator,
&gt;since one of its arguments is a unit-of-measure rather than a real number.
&gt;So I guess we have a choice between adopting this nonstandard usage or
&gt;defining a special function.  To my mind, things would be clearer if we took
&gt;the latter course.

Well, OK, that is a point. Its a very natural extension, however, and 
I think it would  simplify the ontology here. But its a stylistic 
issue, not a deep one.

&gt;As for your point that not all measures can be
&gt;"multiplied" by real numbers, I agree.  The Ontolingua ontologies partition
&gt;physical quantities into two classes:  constant quantities and function
&gt;quantities.  If we require that the unit-of-measure relate to a constant
&gt;quantity, then I think we can avoid the sort of problem you're indicating.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jerry Hobbs has a very nice general theory of measuring
&gt; &gt; scales, by the way.
&gt;
&gt;Again, a pointer would be appreciated.

I heard about it from him directly; maybe you could email him and ask 
for a reference. I can't find it on the SRI site.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;(instance-of TimeIntervalAbstractionFn UnaryFunction)
&gt; &gt; &gt;(nth-domain TimeIntervalAbstractionFn 1 Object)
&gt; &gt; (range TimeIntervalAbstractionFn TimeInterval)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd suggest a less barabaric name might be 'when' (and a similar
&gt; &gt; function from things to their locations called 'where')
&gt;
&gt;OK, this sounds like a good name, and I like the idea of a function from
&gt;things to their locations.  Note though that the two functions won't be
&gt;exactly analogous, since the locative function will require an extra
&gt;argument, viz. a point in time or a time interval.

Ah, that is your non-4d intuition at work. In 4-d, when and where are 
just projections into the temporal and spatial subspaces.  But I 
agree that an endurantist can hardly say anything about a continuant 
without invoking a time to say it at.
