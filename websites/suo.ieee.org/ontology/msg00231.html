Hi Graham,

	David Whitten is responsible for the structural ontology.  Chris
Menzel and I have converted five of the SUO sources into a SUO-KIF format
which is compliant with this structural ontology (these five sources are
John Sowa's upper ontology, Casati and Varzi's formal theory of holes, Barry
Smith's formal theory of boundaries, Borgo, Guarino, and Masolo's formal
theory of physical objects, and the Core Plan Representation).  In addition,
Allen's temporal logic and Russell and Norvig's upper ontology had
previously been translated into KIF.  All of these sources/translations can
be accessed at:

 <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>

Currently, I am working on merging all of these sources into a single,
coherent ontology, which I plan to release to the group at the end of this
week.  I'm hoping that this merge can function as the bare beginning of our
eventual SUO.  Furthermore, Adam Pease and I are working on converting the
ITBM-CNR ontologies and the ontologies on the Ontolingua server into SUO-KIF
format.  Once this conversion is complete, we'll make it available in some
form.  

	If you can suggest an appropriate source for biological/medical
concepts, I would be happy to investigate its translation into SUO-KIF.

Sincerely,
Ian Niles

&gt; Subject: SUO - Content
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear all, 
&gt; 	.	I have recently had the chance to start looking at the
&gt; content we have so far. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Jim Schoening pointed me towards some lists Ian 
&gt; Niles and
&gt; David Whitten have posted. These contain mainly what I think of as
&gt; "structural", rather than "semantic" content. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Is there significantly more SUO content elsewhere, or is
&gt; this all we have so far?
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I fully recognise the need to have sound 
&gt; logical structures.
&gt; Nevertheless, I'd be more than a little surprised if the "structural"
&gt; content is going to have the applicability many users will 
&gt; want, or amount
&gt; to the "several thousand terms" specified for the SUO. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Is semantic content intended to be included in 
&gt; the SUO? If
&gt; so, has there been any thought given to the form and coverage 
&gt; of this area?
&gt; I would have expected the intention to include generic 
&gt; things. The AIHW main
&gt; interest would, naturally, be related to subject areas of 
&gt; likely relevance
&gt; to health and welfare matters. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	For example, in the medical / animal biology 
&gt; area, I would
&gt; expect inclusion of each of the major organs and physical 
&gt; features common in
&gt; vertebrates, especially bearing in mind the general 
&gt; commonality of these
&gt; features and the frequency with which most people deal with 
&gt; them (eg at a
&gt; butcher's shop). 
&gt;

&gt; Jim, 
&gt; 	.	At long last I got to look at these. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	My software asks me what application to 
&gt; associate with these
&gt; files. Basically, I feel it doesn't recognise the ".kif" extension. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Any suggestions?

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Jim, 
&gt; 	.		Because I have been concentrating on the SUO-CE
&gt; issue, I am unaware of any SUO content listings, other than possibly a
&gt; structure submitted by (I think) Adam Pease in a PDF format a 
&gt; few weeks ago.
&gt; Have any been developed, or has that stage yet to begin in earnest? 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	If it has, where would I find it. I would like 
&gt; to see what
&gt; opportunities there are for adding in health and community 
&gt; service related
&gt; matter suitable for the SUO level.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	It has just come to my attention that the "defrelation" and
&gt; "deffunction" terms and constructs that I used in the KIF 
&gt; files I sent out
&gt; this afternoon are not (yet) part of SUO KIF.  I guess I was 
&gt; assuming that
&gt; they would be included at some point in the future.  These 
&gt; definitions can
&gt; of course be recast in official SUO KIF by removing the 
&gt; "defrelation" and
&gt; "deffunction" wrappers.  It has also been pointed out to me 
&gt; that the KIF
&gt; version of the Core Plan Representation would be easier to 
&gt; understand if
&gt; comments regarding the key constants of this theory were 
&gt; inserted into the
&gt; file.  Accordingly, I have now inserted these comments, and 
&gt; the revised file
&gt; is attached.  I hope this helps.
&gt; 
&gt; -Ian

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	We here at Teknowledge have been working on converting 
&gt; ontological
&gt; content into SUO KIF.  The sources for this conversion are 
&gt; those listed on
&gt; the "Candidate Content to be Merged into a Standard" web page 
&gt; (linked to the
&gt; SUO web site).  Our hope is that these various SUO KIF 
&gt; formalizations will
&gt; eventually be folded into the overarching SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; 	As the first instalment in this project, I'm attaching 
&gt; three files
&gt; which are SUO KIF translations of the definitions and axioms of,
&gt; respectively,
&gt; *	Barry Smith et Al's theory of bona fide/fiat boundaries/objects
&gt; (Smith.kif),
&gt; *	Nicola Guarino et Al's theory of physical objects 
&gt; (Guarino.kif), and
&gt; 
&gt; *	the Core Plan Representation (CPR.kif).  
&gt; 	We would appreciate any comments/criticisms you might have about
&gt; these formalizations and/or the original content.
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Ian Niles
&gt;
