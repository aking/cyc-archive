&gt;Dear Graham,
&gt;
&gt;I would say that there are 3 basic types of thing:
&gt;
&gt;1. things that have an extension (exist) in space time (I would call these
&gt;individuals - but this is a broader use than some would give this word).
&gt;
&gt;2. Things that have members (rather than parts), such as
&gt;classes/sets/collections. These are timeless.
&gt;
&gt;3. Ordered collections - Tuples, classifications of them are known as
&gt;relations. These are timeless, and indeed one way of defining tuples
derives
&gt;them from sets.

Let me add a few more. First, there are many abstracta (which have no
spatiotemporal location) other than collections or ordered collections. In
fact, just about any mathematical structure can be considered among these
things, and there may be more kinds of mathematical structure than there are
kinds of physical object (groups, lattices, topological spaces, modular
structures, sheafs, algebras of various kinds, categories, you name it.)

GH&gt;	Agreed. I talk of "concepts", and differentiate these from thoughts
in the former can exist independently of any "mind" having ever considered
them. . 

Second, most people (though not all) would make a distinction between the
things that occupy space and/or time, on the one hand, and the spaces and/or
times that they occupy, on the other.  Third, there are things that can be
located in spacetime without themselves occupying any of spacetime: moments,
surfaces of various kinds, point motions, pathways, etc.. Geography alone
supplies a rich vocabulary for talking about such things and the
relationships between them. 

GH&gt;	Agreed. I also think of these as essentially concepts, a very handy
way of thinking of them such as when walking across a state border where
there is no fence, etc. 

Then again there are entire other categories of entities, whose locative
nature is harder to classify but many people want to have as real,
first-class entities: causes, results, manners (the 'way' something is done,
eg happily or with a good style), and things indicated by words like
'nature' (small 'n', as in 'it is of the nature of fish to swim in water') ,
'tendency', 'attraction'. Others make reference to 'tropes' , in order to
make sense of phrases like 'the greenness of the grass delighted me'; it is
not enough, on this view to simply refer here to the fact that the grass is
green: one has to be able to talk about the *way* that this is true. 

GH&gt;	Agreed. So basically you are providing a framework for types of
concepts. 

"Promiscuous" ontologies, by the way, admit far more kinds of distinction.
For example, consider walking quickly from SRI to Stanford (about a mile;
Jerry Hobb's example). Most of us would think of this as one thing, called
something like a transporation event. In Jerry's ontology it is several
things: at least two: a going from SRI to Stanford (which is slow, since one
is walking rather than driving) and a walking from SRI to Stanford (which is
fast, since one is hurrying along). In general , how many things it is
depends on how many ways there are to describe it. 

GH&gt;	To me this is going beyond any standard ontology, and would rather
be an example of an "applied" ontology. These aren't basic concepts, but
rather characteristics or descriptions of them. I wouldn't see them as
candidates for the SUO, tho' I would see us as needing to provide a means
for handling them..

&gt;Regards
&gt;      Matthew

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Pat,
&gt; &gt; 	.	Thanks for this reply.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 	.	From it I take it that there are three kinds of items to
&gt; &gt; consider:
&gt; &gt; *	objects, including immaterial ones like emotions, sensations,
&gt; &gt; opinions, knowledge, whose attributes (including existence) are 4-D;
&gt; &gt; *	relations between objects, whose attributes are also 4-D, eg.
&gt; &gt; friendship; and
&gt; &gt; *	time histories of objects and relations, and their
&gt; &gt; attributes, which
&gt; &gt; are 3-D (timeless);
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 	.	Is that a fair summary, or is there a point you
&gt; &gt; feel I've
&gt; &gt; missed?
&gt; &gt;

I think there are worlds you have missed here. For example, I dont 
understand the sense in which an emotion can be 4-D or 3-D. I wouldnt 
describe an emotion as an abject at all (though it may be an entity.)

I also don't think that it is right to say that a relation has 4-d 
attributes. One perceived advantage of the 4-d way of thinking is 
that relations have *no* spatiotemporal attributes.

And finally, its not right to say that an attribute of something is 
3-d and therefore timeless. It is timeless because it makes to 
refernece to time: it does not hold relative to a time, or at one 
time but not at another. But that doesnt make it 3-D. I dont know 
whatquite in what sense an attribute can be said to even have a 
dimension.
