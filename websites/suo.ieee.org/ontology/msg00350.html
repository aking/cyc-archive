John, Pat et al, 
	.		I have a different perspective. I distinguish
between things like "thought" and things like "concept" 

	.	To me, for example, a thought is an action of processing
information. In this paradigm thought can be carried out by a brain or
computer. 

	.	By contrast, a concept is a theoretical construct comprising
pattern(s) and/or procedure(s). Eg. the concept of planetary motion (whether
it is Kepler's concept, which he thought of, or the concept of the pattern
that the planets actually follow). To me a concept can exist without any
information processing device having considered it. 

	.	I suggest this as a useful way of differentiating between
the activity and the pattern. 

	.	Where a concept was the result of a thought, it will often
be in the form of a "mental model", since it may not precisely or accurately
reflect reality. 

	.	I guess this means I have committed the heresy of
disagreeing with the BELOVED CSP. Worse, I do not repent from it (though I
will be happy to do so if I can be shown the error in my thoughts).

Pat,

I agree that a crystal isn't the best example.  A much better example would
be DNA, which would have made Peirce ecstatic, if he had known about it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; (Peirce, CP 4.536, 4.550 ff).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; | Thought is not necessarily connected with a brain.
&gt;&gt; &gt; | It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; | throughout the purely physical world;  and one
&gt;&gt; &gt; | can no more deny that it is really there, than
&gt;&gt; &gt; | that the colors, the shapes, etc., of objects
&gt;&gt; &gt; | are really there.  (CP 4.551).

&gt;OK, I stand corrected. Hats off to CSP, though I have to say I think 
&gt;he could have chosen a better example than crystals. He seems to be 
&gt;identifying 'thought' with something like 'order', or, in more modern 
&gt;terms, low entropy.

Peirce did, in fact, discuss entropy extensively (I don't have the
quotations handy).  But I believe that what he was getting at in this
passage was the fact that there is something inherent in the molecular
structure at a submicroscopic level, which has a causal effect on the kinds
of structures that are produced at the macro level.

That "something", which was unknown to CSP, serves to guide each individual
molecule into its proper position in the crystal structure.  In the same
way, there is some microscopic pattern in the bee's DNA, which causes the
bees to cooperate as they do in finding honey, building a hive, and caring
for the larvae.

Although we have much more knowledge about DNA than Peirce had, no one today
can show how any particular sequence of amino acids determines how bees
cooperate in the hive, yet we can safely say that there is a causal link
between the DNA and that behavior.

Peirce would say that "thought" in the human brain is of the same nature as
the bit patterns that cause a robot to perform some action, the DNA that
causes a bee to make honey, or the quantum-mechanical wave functions that
cause molecules to form a crystal.

John
