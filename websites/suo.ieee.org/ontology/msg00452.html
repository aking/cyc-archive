Chris,

&gt;
&gt; Firstly I think it odd that the *only* two alternatives are 
&gt; to either accept
&gt; the document as it stands or stop the project - which some people have
&gt; suggested.

I would define the first alaternative as:  YES means the group agrees to
start working on the document, not that they accept it as it stands, other
than as a starting point.  


&gt; 
&gt; Surely, if there are shortfalls we can work through these and 
&gt; then submit
&gt; another document.

If you want the group to work on the shortfalls, you should vote YES.


&gt; 
&gt; It also appeared to me that this document was not the result of a
&gt; collaboration.

Ian posted two prior versions of the Merged Ontology and did get some
feedback from a few people, but this was a far cry from the level of
collaboration that should take place in a group.  In fact, this lack of
collaboration was, I believe, was what prompted this for a vote, to get more
WG involvement.  

But you may be refering to the issue of who contolled the changes.  Ian did,
not the group.  A key element of this vote is the transition of control of
this document from its originators to the group.  

 
&gt; But overall, I think there is a basic management problem 
&gt; here. I do not see
&gt; how you can expect a group to agree, let alone to spend much time
&gt; contributing, if there is a lack of clarity about the overall 
&gt; process being
&gt; used and inadequate transparency in the process of compiling the group
&gt; document - including how individual contributions are dealt with.


IEEE provides very few Policies and Procedures for how a working group does
its work.  But this is probably good since all groups are unique.  This is
why we had to invent our own rules for who can vote.  I assure you we will
continuously run into situations where we don't have policies and procedures
or a process for dealing with something.  We can try to prepare ourselves,
but when not prepared, we'll have to do our best to invent ourselves as we
go.  If there's anyone motivated to head a committee on Policies and
Procedures, please step forward.  But it's very important that we not get
too hung up on procedures and lose sight of our main objective of developing
a useful document and building maximum consensus.  Also, the only vote that
really matters is the final ballot, and that is closely controlled by IEEE
and key to their maintaining ANSI accreditation.

Jim
