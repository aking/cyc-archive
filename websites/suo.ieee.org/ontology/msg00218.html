John --

I agree that a very significant effort is before us, and one that promises
significant and far-reaching repercussions.  I suspect that's why most of
us are enthusiastic about participating in such an endeavor.

I would like to add a thought based on your example.  The effort to
discover the source of the Amazon may be a good metaphor for the magnitude
of our effort.  However, I think it also directly raises some ontological
considerations.  By that I mean, the very concept of "source" - of the
Amazon or any other river.  Isn't it true that this is a general concept
that could be defined and used in a number of applications?  Isn't it
likely that the source of the Amazon could be defined using the same set of
considerations as the source of the Nile, or the source of the Mississippi?
OF course the geographical particulars would be unique in each case, but
mightn't we expect a general consideration such as  "the peak or ridge that
is the farthest distance from the mouth of the river and that still allows
water to eventually drain into the river in question"?  I'm just making
this up for purposes of illustration, to raise the question of whether such
a term as river source would not be a valid consideration for ontology?

Then, the further question arises, should river source be a valid
consideration for what we define as "upper ontology"?  Or would this be
confined to one or more lower level geographical, geological, and or
geo-political ontologies?  Is there some set of meaning components from an
upper ontology that would help organize the concepts in such more specific
ontologies?  Isn't this what we are talking about?

Subject:  SUO: A typical definition




A major purpose of the SUO is to establish a foundation for sharing,
reusing, and calibrating the ontologies of independently developed
systems that need to interoperate.

A precise, formal notation, such as KIF, is necessary for stating
the definitions and axioms.  But long before we get to the stage
where we can begin writing anything formal, it is necessary to
negotiate (usually in a natural language) what we need to formalize.

As an example of the problems involved, I would like to cite the
recent story about the discovery of the source of the Amazon River:

  <A  HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm</A>

The Amazon River has been known to western explorers for nearly
500 years, but its source was not discovered until 1971, and all the
controversies had not been resolved until now.  Following are the
kinds of options that the explorers had to consider:

   Smithsonian Institution geographer Andrew Johnson said the source
   of the Amazon could be defined as the most distant point in the
   drainage basin from which surface water ran year round, or the
   furthest point from which water could possibly flow to the Atlantic.
   "The Nevado Mismi fits both of these definitions," said Johnson.

Note that people have been talking about the Amazon and "its source"
for centuries before they had a clear idea of the definition of "its
source" or the actual referent of that term.  Yet people have been
able to talk effectively about those undefinited and unknown entities,
discuss alternate definitions, and plan expeditions to search for
the actual referents -- all without having a clear idea of what they
were looking for.

The following quotation from the above article gives some idea of
the size of a typical expedition:

   The NGS team included 22 members from the United States, Poland,
   Peru, Canada and Spain. They moved by foot, Jeep, bicycle and
   horseback to explore the five remote Andean rivers that combine
   to form the Amazon - the Apurimac, Huallaga, Mantaro, Maranion
   and Urubamba-Vilcanota.

Observation:  This level of effort is necessary to define nearly every
term in the ontology, ranging from the most general terms at the top
down to the referents of what Russell called "definite descriptions"
such as "the source of the Amazon".

I wanted to mention this example for two reasons:  The first is that
we are undertaking a very large task -- a point that has been noted
on this list many times from different perspectives.  The second is
that before any formal axioms can be written, a great deal of informal
analysis, study, discussion, negotation, and often very arduous and
back-breaking work must be done to determine exactly what is to be
formalized.
