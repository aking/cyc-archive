Pat,

On the Wadi/slough point. Wadi's in Arabia are usually dry (or at least the
part I was in) - they typically only fill up for a short period after rains
(Is this also true for sloughs?). In this case, it makes sense to deal with
the river bed rather than the river. But in cases where there is usually
water - I think we usually associate the river with the water.

I agree wholeheartedly that 'the spatiotemporal contiguity rule is pretty
good for physical objects almost all the time." for most types of objects.
There are some types where the rule does not work so well. Two come to mind:
what are sometimes called roles and one interpretation of mass names.

I can illustrate the 'role' type with the last point relating to my car's
wheel.
You said:
'I'd say not that the wheel's existence was intermittent, but that there had
been several wheels.'

I must confess to being a little surprised at this - given your 4-D outlook.
Maybe you have reservations about *any* region of space-time however
heterogeneous or disconnected being a candidate for an object.

Anyway - back to the types. One analysis would have 'my car's wheel' (or
'Chairman of Acme Ltd. or ...) as being a role that is played by various
wheels (persons ...). This would lead presumably to an ontology with
categories for objects and roles. Another analysis would identify the role
with the 4-D extent composed of the stages of the wheels (persons) playing
the role. In engineering, when a design engineer specifies an oil rig (say)
they specify the parts/components and give them reference numbers (tag
numbers). Here they clearly name the 'role' without any consideration of
which particular 'object' occupies it.

As you know, one can do a similar analysis of mass terms. Milk refers to all
the milk there is now, was or ever has been. This is seriously temporally
and spatially disconnected.

In general, it seems to me that we avoid discontinuities whether spatial or
temporal as they make life more complicated. We seem to tolerate spatial
discontinuities (e.g. trombone being dismantled to be put in its case) of
'typical' physical objects more readily than temporal ones. But there are
cases (and categories of objects) where the these discontinuities occur
systematically - e.g. roles and masses.

Regards,
Chris

&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;A really small, niggling point.
&gt;
&gt;You wrote:
&gt;"I think what Matthew may have been talking about are cases where
&gt;something might have an intermittent existence. This isn't plausible
&gt;for physical things, but there are some reasonably intuitive
&gt;examples."
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me that it can be plausible for some kinds of physical objects.
&gt;Wouldn't it be better to say that we normally do not think of physical
&gt;things as having intermittent existence. But that there are examples.

Yes, I agree.

&gt;I seem
&gt;to remember someone mentioning the polar ice cap in one SUO message
&gt;(apparently it sometimes melts away completely). Another geographical
&gt;example would be rivers that run dry.

In locales where such rivers are common, however, there is a rather
different way of talking about them: they are called 'sloughs' or
'washes' (in the SW USA) and I believe 'wadis' in Arabia, and the
name refers to the dry bed rather than to what we would call the
river; the thing we would call a river is simply a wash filled with
water, a condition which is more like an occurrent than a continuant.
(Camping in a wash for shelter is a famous bad decision made by
visitors to the desert.)

&gt;It seems to me that my car's front
&gt;right wheel is a physical object (though some might want to relegate this
to
&gt;a role - whatever that it is) - over the life of my car, this wheel has had
&gt;an intermittent existence.

Really? Do you mean that the wheel has been changed? If so, I'd say
not that the wheel's existence was intermittent, but that there had
been several wheels.

&gt;
&gt;The substantive point behind this - for me - is that temporal continuity is
&gt;good requirement for identity (temporal unity) but unfortunately not an
&gt;absolute rule.

Yes, I basically agree, although I think the spatiotemporal
contiguity rule is pretty good for physical objects almost all the
time. The exceptions are where the object has a geographical way of
being identified (the big lump of ice at this position, when it is
there) and it is easier to keep the geographical identification than
the continuity one, especially since spatiotemporal continuity doesnt
coincide with substance continuity for these things anyway. (Contrast
the case where someone stole Stonehenge and replaced it with a very
good replica made of authentic stone. Most people would still make
the distinction and call the second one a fake.)
