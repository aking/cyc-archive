Dear John,

&gt; The main thing that I object to in Nicola's position is his
&gt; interpretation of identity and his claim that the statue
&gt; and the clay are two different things.  That is not something
&gt; that either scientists or the proverbial T. C. Mits would say.

Well actually in the usual case the piece of clay and the vase are two
different objects under a 4D view. This is because normally, the vase is
made from a single piece of clay. Thus the spatio-temporal extent of the
piece of clay is different from the spatio-temporal extent of the vase
(except when both come into existance and cease to exist at the same time).
So normally the vase is a sub-state of the piece of clay. Whilst the piece
of clay is also the vase the two are of course co-incident.

I'm sure you know this, but others may not.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; Subject: RE: SUO: The Story So Far
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; As I said in my earlier notes, I believe that there are multiple
&gt; points involved in this discussion.  And it is misleading to
&gt; lump them all under the terms "endurantist" or "perdurantist":
&gt; 
&gt;  1. 3D or 4D coordinate systems.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Processes or objects as the fundamental entities.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Causality or time as the fundamental foundation.
&gt; 
&gt;  4. Interpretation of identity and identity conditions.
&gt; 
&gt; The most "weird" position that Nicola seems to promote is
&gt; his interpretation of identity.  That is separable from the
&gt; other points.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I know Pat has already mentioned Barry Smith and Peter 
&gt; Simons. Can I also
&gt; &gt;suggest Michael Loux (see his introductory book on Metaphysics -
&gt; &gt;particularly the sections on Endurantism and Perdurantism  
&gt; :-) and E. J.
&gt; &gt;Loux (Possibility of Metaphysics).
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that the first step toward resolving the disputes
&gt; is to get rid of those two terms.  They lump too many separate
&gt; issues under two umbrella terms.  I refuse to use them, and I
&gt; strongly suggest that we stop using them in these email
&gt; discussions.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will name more if it would make any
&gt; &gt;difference. There are lots of people who seriously take this 
&gt; position.
&gt; 
&gt; That is another reason why I want to get rid of the terms.
&gt; Peter Simons, for example, has done a great deal of work with
&gt; Whitehead's process philosophy.  I can't believe that he is
&gt; fully devoted to anything as weird as what Nicola was proposing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;You say:
&gt; &gt;The view that the statue and the clay are the "same thing"
&gt; &gt;can be safely held in either a 3-D or a 4-D poin of view.
&gt; &gt;I really don't know how to classify Nicola's position,
&gt; &gt;since it seems to be inconsistent with the way ordinary
&gt; &gt;human beings talk, with the way that scientists talk, and
&gt; &gt;with the way that most philosophers talk.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;This seems to me false. On the face of it our language is 
&gt; 'Endurantist'.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I don't know what you mean by that, since ordinary
&gt; English is perfectly well suited to being used on all
&gt; sides of the four issues I mention above.  See, for example,
&gt; Whitehead's essay, which is written in ordinary English:
&gt; 
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/anw_obj.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/anw_obj.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I do not say 'my life went to the cinema last night' - or 'I am
&gt; long (in the
&gt; &gt;same sense as 'I have had a long life'). We certainly do not 
&gt; say 'a temporal
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;stage of me went to the cinema last night'.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course not.  We use ordinary English terms, which can be
&gt; formally defined in many different ways.  And the simplest way
&gt; I can see to define them makes them perfectly consistent with
&gt; Whitehead's process philosophy.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;As you can see, I think, as a matter of fact, you are 
&gt; incorrect in the way
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;you characterize 'Nicola's' position.
&gt; 
&gt; The main thing that I object to in Nicola's position is his
&gt; interpretation of identity and his claim that the statue
&gt; and the clay are two different things.  That is not something
&gt; that either scientists or the proverbial T. C. Mits would say.
&gt; 
&gt; John
