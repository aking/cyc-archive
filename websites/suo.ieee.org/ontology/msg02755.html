Ian --
   Your questions are quite reasonable, and I will give
some very brief comments which I hope clarify the 
points.  

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    I have mentioned previously that the creation of an "abstract"
&gt; &gt; category as disjoint from "physical" at the highest level 
&gt; &gt; is in my view unnecessary and highly undesirable, since it
&gt; &gt; would preclude, for example, the creation of a general concept
&gt; &gt; "object" which subsumes both physical objects and abstract objects.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't follow you here.  The Merged Ontology does contain a general concept
&gt; that subsumes both Physical and Abstract.  This concept is Entity.
&gt; 
   To be more specific: In the merged ontology, "physical" is defined 
(in the gloss) as an entity that has location in space-time.  But I
would 
like to create a more general concept of object, as something that has
a location in some (possibly abstract) space and that also has at least 
one attribute.  The physical objects, with location in the more specific 
space-time, would then be logically subclasses of the general "object"
class.
The point here is to distinguish an object and an attribute by the
relation between them.  The concepts of "object" and "attribute" are
probably best considered as primitives, and the relation that
distinguishes 
these primitives is, I believe, best defined at the highest level. 
Without
a general "object" that subsumes both abstract and physical objects,
this
more general relation cannot be created in one inheritable location, but
would
need to be duplicated for the abstract-object class and the
physical-object
class.  This isn't fatal, it is just unnecessary, more complicated, and
more difficult to maintain during changes, and I think, could make the
SUO more difficult to learn and use by not showing clearly the relation
of
physical objects and abstract object.  The same will be true for
processes, states, and events.
   I am uncertain how the definition of "physical" as being located 
in space-time affects the definitions of mental objects. (more
below on mental objects).


&gt; &gt; There are other problems, such as if one wants to
&gt; &gt; define a space or time as a set (or at least as a collection),
&gt; &gt; it would be impossible in the above classification to consider 
&gt; &gt; either as a "physical" concept, even though space-time is as
&gt; &gt; physical as my hand, as I understand current theories
&gt; &gt; of cosmology.
&gt; 

&gt; I don't agree that the high-level distinction between 'Physical' and
&gt; 'Abstract' precludes the possibility of defining reasonable notions of space
&gt; and time.  In the Merged Ontology, 'TimeMeasure' is a subclass of
&gt; 'Quantity', which, in turn, is a subclass of 'Abstract'.  'TimeMeasure' is
&gt; subdivided into 'TimeMeasure-Position' and 'TimeMeasure-Duration'.
&gt; 'TimePoint' is a subclass of the former of these two classes, and
&gt; 'TimeInterval' is a subclass of both of them - intervals have both temporal
&gt; extent and location.  It seems to be that the concept of Space could be
&gt; cashed out in a similar way, viz. as some sort of specification of abstract
&gt; measures of the physical world.
&gt; 


&gt; &gt; One tactic is used by CYC, for example, where the concept
&gt; &gt; of "set or collection" is at a very high level, allowing
&gt; &gt; one to treat groups of physical objects to some extent
&gt; &gt; like sets, but also allowing purely mathematical sets 
&gt; &gt; to be defined.
&gt; 
&gt; This concept of a set-like thing which has a position in space-time is
&gt; represented by the term 'Collection' in the Merged Ontology.  It is an
&gt; immediate subclass of 'Object'.  Note that something counts as an Object
&gt; just in case it has a position in space-time and it is relatively persistent
&gt; (I'm hoping that we'll eventually be able to cash out this notion of
&gt; persistent in a way that is acceptable to both 3D and 4D enthusiasts).
&gt; 
   Yes, "collection" does serve the purpose of having physical
set-like classes, but does "set" then always have to be
mathematical?  I can envision collections that are neither
physical nor mathematical.  that's why I like the CYC
"#$SetOrCollection"
which can be either or neither physical nor mathematical.
The point here is to make the SUO as general as possible, that is to
allow everything that is not logically inconsistent, so as to
maximize its potential uility and wide adoption.

&gt; In the Merged Ontology, 'TimeMeasure' is a subclass of
&gt; 'Quantity', which, in turn, is a subclass of 'Abstract'.  'TimeMeasure' is
&gt; subdivided into 'TimeMeasure-Position' and 'TimeMeasure-Duration'.
   I do not fully understand the "units of measure" part of the
merged ontolgy.  I prefer to treat measurements as complex concepts
containing a quantifier and a dimensional unit.  The dimensional
unit may be a measurement of a physical entity or physical property, 
but the quantifier part should be more like a mathematical object.

&gt; &gt;    An outline of an alternative top few levels could be, just for
&gt; &gt; illustation
&gt; &gt; (concepts with a preceding ** have multiple inheritance in
&gt; &gt; this short
&gt; &gt; classification):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Entity
&gt; &gt;     Object
&gt; &gt;        Physical Object
&gt; &gt;            Ordinary Matter
&gt; &gt;                Solid Object
&gt; &gt;                    Rigid Object
&gt; &gt;                    **Powder
&gt; &gt;                Liquid Object
&gt; &gt;                Gaseous Object
&gt; &gt;                Semisolid Object
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't it make more sense to abstract the qualities of 'Solid', 'Liquid',
&gt; 'Physical', 'Semisolid', and make them specifications of your category
&gt; 'Physical Quality' below?
&gt; 
   Yes, but the attribute, e.g.  "solid" as a physical quality is
distinct 
from "Solid object", which is the specific concept listed in that point 
of the hierarchy.  One can, of course, manufacture ad hoc a concept
"solid object" by attributing the attribute "solid" to an "object", but
I 
think it is very useful to reify "solid object" as a class in itself. 
CYC 
does a lot with concepts that are in effect objects, even when it
discusses
suhstances such as glass. In CYC "glass" is actually some piece of
glass.
This differs from my own preference, which is to have a concept 
"substance" 
distinct from objects made of that substance, and this is one of the few 
points in CYC where I think there is something important missing.


&gt; &gt;                    **Human being
&gt; &gt;            Electromagnetic Wave
&gt; &gt;            Plasma
&gt; &gt;            Condensed Matter
&gt; &gt;                Neutron Star
&gt; &gt;                Black Hole
&gt; 
&gt; The preceding five terms deserve a spot in the Merged Ontology.  I'll try to
&gt; find a place for them there.  Any suggestions about where they might best
&gt; fit in?
&gt; 

&gt; &gt;            Inanimate Object
&gt; &gt;                Artefact
&gt; &gt;        Mental Object
&gt; 
&gt; I'd argue for steering away from 'Mental Object', 'Idea', and 'Purpose' as
&gt; high-level reified categories.  I don't think their meaning or usefulness is
&gt; clear, and there are good reasons to think that the concept of a mental
&gt; object is just an artifact of natural language.
&gt; 
    I think it is very important to have "purpose" (in the sense of a
goal,
or objective as an  impetus to action) so that we can properly define
a "purposive agent", and make sense of human activities, which almost
always 
have some purpose.  If we leave it to domain-specific ontologies to
define "purpose" I fear that the foundation for commercial transactions
will be so vague as to lead to serious incompatibility between
systems left to their own definitions.

&gt; &gt;        Agent
&gt; &gt;            Physical Agent
&gt; &gt;                Purposive Agent
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure how 'Agent', 'Purposive Agent', and 'Cognitive Agent' differ
&gt; from one another.
&gt; 
    A microbe can be a purposive agent, e.g. when it moves toward light
or nutrients, or metabolizes some chemical.  The "purpose" in this case 
was generated as a result of evolution, not of some neural 
information-processing event.
    A cognitive agent is tougher to define, because we have to set some 
arbitrary limit on the complexity of an information-processing process
to distinguish simple agents like a thermostat, which reacts to
temperature
by turning on or off a heating system, and more complicated cognitive
systems such as humans, or eventually (if we are successful) intelligent
robots.

&gt; &gt;                    Microbe
&gt; &gt;                    Plant
&gt; &gt;                    Animal
&gt; &gt;                        **Mammal
&gt; &gt;                             **Human Being
&gt; &gt;                Inanimate Agent
&gt; 
&gt; What would be an example of an 'Inanimate Agent'?
&gt; 
   "a ball broke the window" or "the spilled acid ate a hole in the
carpet" or "the tornado blew the roof off my house".  The ball and 
acid and tornado are inanimate agents.  They do things to
other objects, acting as causal factors.


&gt; &gt;            Idea
&gt; &gt;                Proposition
&gt; &gt;            Purpose
&gt; &gt;        Mathematical Object
&gt; 
&gt; I'd also argue against a special category of 'Mathematical Object', since
&gt; the specifications you list here (excepting Number) are applicable to a wide
&gt; variety of objects.  For example, we can create the set of world
&gt; governments, we can define functions that map nations to their governments,
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
    The set of world governments may be a good example of a
"SetOrCollection" which
is neither physical nor mathematical.


&gt; &gt;     Relation
&gt; &gt;         Function
&gt; &gt;             Process
&gt; &gt;                 Physical Process
&gt; &gt;                     Mental Process
&gt; &gt;                         Communication
&gt; 
&gt; The subhierarchy above seems a bit confusing to me.  'Process' is a
&gt; specification of 'Function'?  'Mental Process' is a specification of
&gt; 'Physical Process'?  'Communication' is a 'Mental Process'?
&gt; 
    Yes, as I view it this is the most economical way to generate
such concepts from more general ones.
   A physical process can be viewed as a function relating the state 
of a physical system as a function of time.  A more abstract 
generalization would be for a function to relate the state of *any* 
system to a generalized "progress" coordinate.  For example, the 
rotation of an idealized sectorized sphere might be plotted as 
the % of the western hemisphere visible from some vantage point as 
a function of the degrees of rotation.
   A mental process is listed here as a subclass of physical because 
I don't know of any mental process that takes place without some
physical change also occurring.  This may not be important, but it
makes sense to me.
   I guess it seems to be intuitively clear to me that communication
is a mental process, but I suppose that depends on what one
thinks "mental" means.   I think of communication as a transfer
of information between two thinking agents, and "thinking" is 
something that is mental, a process characteristic of a cognitive 
agent.  At this point I didn't think it was necessary to get 
into the question of the relation between process and event, which 
is fascinating and worth a few papers in itself.
   As I mentioned, it will take more time than I have available right 
now to provide a formal axiomatization and a (hopefully) convincing
argument for the utility of these distinctions, and I apologize 
for not taking more time to make my comments more concrete and detailed
at this time.  And I repeat my thanks for your efforts to make these
discussions more concrete and productive.
   I will, of course, try to answer specific questions as best I can.
