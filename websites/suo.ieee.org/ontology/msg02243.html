Adam and Pat,

I believe that you are both raising fundamental questions that have
not been adequately resolved.  Instead of commenting on the entire
interchange, I would like to extract a small part that may suggest
a possible way of proceeding:

AP&gt;&gt;It's more like saying that while the Wright brothers are building 
&gt;&gt;the plane, for the first time, that they can be confident they'll 
&gt;&gt;fix any flaws and would appreciate any help in making the plane fly.

PH&gt;I would suggest that before comparing yourself to the Wright brothers 
&gt;that you read a history of aviation. The Wrights were excellent 
&gt;engineers, and started by doing thorough testing of lift/drag ratios 
&gt;of a collection of model airfoils. There was a long tradition of 
&gt;building-and-see-it-it-works before then, and most of the pilots 
&gt;didn't live long.

The interesting point about this analogy is the reason why the
Wright brothers succeeded when so many more famous inventors failed.
Among them was Samuel Pierpont Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian,
eminent physicist, astronomer, and author of a book _Experiments in
Aerodynamics_.  Following is a brief summary (with pictures) of his
efforts and his crash into the Potomac River on December 8, 1903,
just 9 days before Wilbur and Orville's success:

   <A  HREF="http://aerostories.free.fr/precurseurs/langley/page2.html">http://aerostories.free.fr/precurseurs/langley/page2.html</A>

What Langley and everybody else were doing was emphasizing power.
They were all focused on powerful engines, but the Ws took a totally
different approach:  they emphasized control.  They observed birds,
not flapping, but soaring.  They invented the idea of "wing warping" in
imitation of the way the birds controlled their flight, and adapted
it to kites and gliders long before they added an engine.

Following is a slightly longer story about the W. brothers:

   <A  HREF="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~stwright/WrBr/taleplane.html">http://www.wam.umd.edu/~stwright/WrBr/taleplane.html</A>

An excerpt from that story:

"Instead of designing and building whole craft, the two brothers
constantly found ways to test individual components and subsystems
of their designs. Early on, Wilbur realized that a plane could be
controlled on its lateral axis (one wing tips up while the other tips
down) if the wings of a plane were twisted, turning the craft into "an
animated windmill." Instead of building an airplane with this design,
the two brothers fashioned a 5-foot biplane kite. By flying the kite
in the breeze, the two brothers were able to show that twisting 
the wings had the intended effect in causing the kite to roll.

"The identification of an effective method of lateral control is
universally recognized as being one of the most important contributions
the Wrights made to aviation, and was the idea protected by their
patent issued May 22, 1906."

There are many morals that could be drawn from this story, and the
one I would apply to the ontology effort is the emphasis on control
(systematic methodology) rather than power (massive accumulation of
axioms).  I believe that Adam is correct in trying to build the
whole airplane and Pat is correct in calling for more work on the
components.  But I would like to see more work on the methodology
for combining components and controlling them in both unpowered
and powered flights.

John Sowa
