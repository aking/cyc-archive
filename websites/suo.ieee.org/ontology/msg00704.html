Pat, 
	.	I accept that it isn't easy to explain the underlying bases
in a standard. That's one of the reasons developing a standard isn't simple
and easy as people tend to think at first glance. 

	.	Further comment incorporated below, prefaced "GH4&gt;	".

&gt;Pat Hayes&gt;
&gt;There are relations which closely correspond to the existence of these
&gt;events, but one has to keep things straight to avoid confusion., For
&gt;example, in a billing, there is the relation (between two agents,
&gt;presumably, and a time) of a billing event having occurred (or, a bill
&gt;having been sent) between the agents at the time. But the event, and the
&gt;relation, are not the same kind of thing, and can't be identified with each
&gt;other.
&gt;
&gt;GH3&gt;	I'm trying to scope "relation". The event was a process which took a
&gt;finite period of time to occur. Is the relation the fact that this occurred
&gt;between the two parties?

No, a relation isnt a fact.  Facts just hold, but relations relate other
things.

GH4&gt;	Fair enough. 

&gt;.....
&gt; &gt;GH2&gt;	I wonder whether we can get to a stage where we can appreciate each
&gt; &gt;other's concepts of relation.
&gt;
&gt;I'm using the word in the sense in which it used throughout logic
(including
&gt;SUO-KIF) and mathematics.
&gt;
&gt;GH3&gt;	Obviously, I don't appreciate that sense of the words yet.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;In my case, the next thing I need to
&gt; &gt;understand is the meaning of "extension", as you used it above.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know what a set is? If so, the extension of a unary predicate is
&gt;simply the set of all the things that the predicate is true of. For binary
&gt;relations, it's the set of all pairs of things that the elation holds
&gt;between; for trinary relations, it's the set of all triples, etc. .A basic
&gt;assumption of logical languages is that relations with the same extension
&gt;are the same relation; or, in other words, the logic only really talks
about
&gt;the extensions.
&gt;
.......
&gt;But, let's have a go. Does this mean, say,
&gt;that the relation of "billing by post" is a triple, say: (vendor, bill,
&gt;client), that applies to every instance where a vendor has posted
&gt; a bill to a client and the client received the bill?

Close. The relation is a *set* of triples: all the triples that the relation
holds true of. So for example if A sent Bill to B , then the triple &lt;A,
Bill,B&gt; is one of the triples in the "billing by post" relation-set. Of
course there are probably others in the same set. Every time someone gets
billed, that defines another triple in the relation-set. Think of this set
of triples as God's database of all the billings that ever happened or ever
will happen. (It has to be God's since it might well be infinite.) As far as
logic is concerned, this (potentially infinite) set of triples *is* the
relation in question. 

GH4&gt;	I don't see the difference to what my words said? I did say "every".



&gt; &gt;GH2&gt;	I feel there is an important aspect to this. That is that the SUO
&gt; &gt;should be able to be comprehended by its users. Only that way, will they
be
&gt; &gt;able to use it with confidence of being accurate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;GH2&gt;	Therefore, I suggest we are going to have to find means of
&gt; &gt;describing the underlying principles in ordinary, everyday language that
&gt; &gt;the non-cognoscenti are, at least in principle, able to understand. I
believe
&gt; &gt;our target user population should not need to be graduates of high-flown
&gt; &gt;philosophy or logic courses to be able to understand the SUO.
&gt;
&gt;Well, this raises an interesting issue of methodology. Making an ontology
&gt;isn't just writing down what you know in some semiformalized English which
&gt;any bloke can understand just by reading it.  It does involve at least some
&gt;technical competence and facility with the conventions of logic.  Not a
&gt;high-flown competence: just an intro. course would probably do the trick.
&gt;(Ive never taken a logic course in my life, for example.) The fact is that
&gt;any logical-based ontology will use logic, and if someone doesnt have even
a
&gt;basic understanding of the principles of logic then they are likely to make
&gt;mistakes when using it. I don't see any way around this. If you want to lay
&gt;bricks, you have to know at least the basics of bricklaying, or your walls
&gt;will likely fall down.
&gt;
&gt;GH3&gt;	Well, what I would posit is that the relevant rules need to be
&gt;succinctly set out, possibly aided by examples, so that the uninitiated can
&gt;start at the beginning of the document and follow the logic through to the
&gt;end. It is acceptable for the introductory material to be set out in an
&gt;annex, or some other standard, but I would suggest it must be readily
&gt;available in a readily accessible form.

Its not quite that simple, unless the introductory material is going to
amount to something like Symbolic Logic 101.  If someone doesnt have a basic
grasp of what logics mean (and more especially what they DON'T mean) , it
isn't going to be possible to convey the gist of it in 'ordinary English'
without being seriously misleading. 

GH4&gt;	As I said above, I accept that it isn't easy to explain the
underlying bases in a standard. That's one of the reasons developing a
standard isn't simple and easy as people tend to think at first glance. The
principle remains that standards and their supporting documentation need to
be capable of standing alone as reference material. 

GH4&gt;	Perhaps we need a standard or other reference document of
appropriate quality to quote in the SUO standard that adequately covers
Symbolic Logic 101. 

&gt;GH3&gt;	For the SUO, this principle will be absolutely necessary if we are
&gt;to achieve widespread take-up. We cannot afford to hide behind the cloak of
&gt;an artisan's guild.

I'm not trying to hide behind any cloaks or wanting to exclude anyone, but I
am saying that this is to some extent a technical subject, and we have to
assume a basic technical competence. Writing axioms for an ontology is at
least as hard as writing, say, Java code. 

GH4&gt;	I accept that, but I can pick up a Java standard and do that without
having been trained in Java, or even programming if I'm used to using a
computer. That's what I'm saying we need for the SUO too. 

GH4&gt;	We need also to bear in mind the legal role of standards also.
Standards are used as bases for developing things on which peoples' lives
may depend. Causes of accidents are tested in civil and criminal courts.
This is one of the reasons for requiring the comprehensibility of the
document set. A judge and jury, or even a technical expert called in on a
court case, are not going to attend a Symbolic Logic 101 course, they could
be called to take in the documentation and its comprehensibility, though. We
can't avoid the responsibilities of the project. 

&gt;GH3&gt;	I would prefer that we avoid esoteric language, and just say things
&gt;in plain English. For example, the essence of a wheeled vehicle is that it
&gt;incorporates one or more wheels on which it is capable of running to
achieve
&gt;travel. I fully agree that we need to have an unambiguous language for
&gt;stating that, but we shouldn't forget that this sort of simple concept is
&gt;all we will be explaining for many instances in the SUO (cf. wheeled
&gt;ornament, and conceptual vehicle).

If only it were that simple. Starting from simple English sentences there is
a huge terrain of analysis to cross before one can start writing axioms. The
problem is that almost anything you say in English has hidden assumptions
that need to be made explicit in an ontology. Take your example: what
exactly does 'incorporate' mean? What does it mean to say that something is
'capable' of doing something? (What if it never it fact does that, like an
auto that is put through a crash test immediately after manufacture: was
that a wheeled vehicle?)  What does it mean to say that one kind of event
makes something else 'achieve' something? What kind of claim is made by the
assertion that something is travelling? (Is this saying that a certain kind
of event exists? Or that a certain kind of state changes? Or that a certain
kind of dynamic property is true of the moving thing? All of these will look
very different when written axiomatically. Do you want them to entail each
other? What are the general rules of such entailments?) 

GH4&gt;	These are all good points, giving indications of the nature and
extent of the challenge of our task. Writing a Java standard, to quote your
example, involves similar challenges. 

It might be worth reiterating a point of Doug Lenat's. People often think
that Cyc is so called because it is a kind of encyclopedia, but that's
wrong: Cyc is supposed to represent all the stuff that ISNT in the
encyclopedia because the writers of the encyclopedia assume that their
readers already 'know' it. That's the hard part of ontology-building. 

GH4&gt;	I didn't realise this, so I appreciate the elaboration. This gives
me a better appreciation of what Cyc is about. Actually, it does precisely
fit in with the sort of thing I would expect a basic ontology should be
doing. However, I admit I only realised that aspect of the ontologies after
about 2/3rds of the time from the start of the project to now, thanks to
some of the elaborations of Doug McDavid. 

GH4&gt;	I never said I expected the SUO work would be easy. Much standards
development isn't.
