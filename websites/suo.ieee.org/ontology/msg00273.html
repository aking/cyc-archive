Intelligent Dynamic Systems Engineering:  Original Interest Statement 
September 1, 1992 
Jon Awbrey

It seemed useful, as a way of sharpening my focus on goals ahead,
to write up an extended statement of current research interests
and directions.  I realize that many features of this sketch are
likely to change as details are clarified and as new experience
is gained.  As an alternative to the longer essay, an abstract
is provided as a minimal statement.

Abstract

In briefest terms my project is to develop mutual applications
of systems theory and artificial intelligence to each other.
In the current phase of investigation I am taking a standpoint
in systems theory, working to extend its concepts and methods
to cover increasingly interesting classes of intelligent systems.
A natural side-project is directed toward improving the economy
of effort by unifying a selection of tools being used in these
two fields.  My instrumental focus is placed on integrating the
methods of differential geometry with the techniques of logic
programming.  I will attempt to embody this project in the form
of computer-implemented connections between geometric dynamics
and logical AI, and I will measure its success by the extent
and usefulness of this realization.

Description of Current and Proposed Work

I intend to focus primarily on the research area of
artificial intelligence.  In my work of the past few
years I have sought to apply the framework of systems
theory to the problems of AI.  I believe that viewing
intelligent systems as dynamic systems can provide
a unifying perspective for the array of problems and
methods that currently constitutes the field of AI.

The return benefits to systems theory would be equally
valuable, enabling the implementation of more intelligent
software for the study of complex systems.  The engineering
of this software could extend work already begun in simulation
modeling (Widman, Loparo, &amp; Nielsen, 1989), (Yip, 1991), nonlinear
dynamics and chaos (Rietman, 1989), (Tufillaro, Abbott, &amp; Reilly, 1992),
and expert systems (Bratko, Mozetic, &amp; Lavrac, 1989), with increasing
capabilities for qualitative inference about complex systems and for
intelligent navigation of dynamic manifolds (Weld &amp; de Kleer, 1990).

1.  Background

In my aim to connect the enterprises of systems theory
and artificial intelligence I recognize the following facts.
Although the control systems approach was a prevailing one
in the early years of cybernetics and important tributaries
of AI have sprung from its sources, e.g. (Ashby, 1956), (Arbib,
1964, '72, '87, '89), (Albus, 1981), the two disciplines have
been pursuing their separate evolutions for many years now.
The intended scope of AI, overly ambitious or otherwise, forced it
to break free of early bonds, shifting for itself beyond the orbit
of its initial paradigms and the cases that conditioned its origin.

A sample of materials from transition phases of AI's developmental
crises may be found in (Shannon &amp; McCarthy, 1956), (Wiener, 1961, 1964),
(Sayre &amp; Crosson, 1963), (Young, 1964, 1978), (McCulloch, 1965), (Cherry, 1966),
(MacKay, 1969).  Any project to resolder the spun-off domains of AI and systems
theory will probably resort to a similar flux.  In the course of this investigation
it was surprising at first to see these old issues rise again, but the shock has
turned to recognition.  A motion to reinstate thought with action, to amalgamate 
intelligence with dynamics in computational simulation, will naturally revert to 
the neighborhoods of former insights and ride the transits of formative ideas.
It is only to be expected that this essay will run across many of the most 
intersected rights-of-way, if not traveling down and tripping over the very
same ruts, then very likely switching onto a number of parallel tracks.

Informed observers may see good reasons for maintaining the separation
of perspectives between AI and systems theory.  However, the proposition
that these two realms share a common fund of theory and practice, not only
historically but one that demands and deserves a future development, is an
assertion that motivates my efforts here.  Consequently, I thought that
a justification of my objectives might be warranted.  In light of these
facts I have written up this extended rationale and informal review of
literature, in hopes of making a plausible case for attempting this work.
