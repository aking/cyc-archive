JC:  Some words to say you that actually, I do not find very interesting this
     kind of discussion either for modelizing the process of problem-solving
     with or without communication, or to elaborate an ontology which is
     capable of taking into account the contextual aspects.

Yes, our attentions do tend to wander a bit ...

For your orientation, this thread initially began under the title
of "Why Triadicity Matters", in which I sought to explain to the
SUO group what I thought was the relevance of 3-adic relations,
and especially sign relations, toward their ontological goals,
and later I tried to resolve its focus even more in the guise
of "Why Triadicity Matters To Interobjectivity", which nonce
word I synthesized to unify the goals of intercommunication
and interoperation that all concur are official parts of
our Scope &amp; Purpose here.  I made use of the traduction
aspects of the problem you and others were discussing,
simply because these words were "in the air" at the
time -- it seems that we are always making use of
the other's words to mention objects of our own --
then the current title was devised by Doug in
his efforts to relate what I was relating to
his model of a communication channel of the
familiar information-theoretic sort, which
latter task still embroils us in problems.
I append below the links of this catenary
history, this chain mail armamentarium,
this lanuginously e-snarled inquiry.

JC:  Nevertheless I will give you some corrections below.

DM:  Sign:  "rose"

DM:  Referent:
     Imaginary color (expressed in the French language)
     of an imaginary (plastic?) disc, imagined to be used
     as one of number of game pieces in an imaginary game
     of Tower of Hanoi.

JC:  It is a wooden disk, on which is stuck a pink label.

DM:  Sign emitter:  Josiane Caron-Pargue

JC:  No it is the participant Olivier which solved the problem
     of tower of Hanoï with four discs of different colours.

DM:  Purpose:
     Illustration of a technique for analyzing certain kinds of discourse
     (??)

JC:  My aim is to modelize the strategy of problem solving --
     and it is difficult -- this one being characterized
     from the linguistic  marks, which give place to a
     cognitive interpretation (cf the mails precedents).

DM:  Occasion of emission:
     E-mail message on a discussion list of a working group
     of an international standards body, distributed to the
     list on 18 May, 2001.

DM:  Medium:
     E-mail, including multiple servers, software protocols,
     screen display, etc.

DM:  Understanding:
     The symbol "rose" standing metonymously for
     a pink imaginary disc in an imaginary game.

DM:  Intended recipient(s) of sign:
     Participants in the e-mail list of a working group
     of an international standards body.

JC:  The game is not an imaginary one:

     The game consists of three aligned pegs:  a, b, c,
     and of four discs of different colours and size,
     placed from the large bottom one to the tiny top one
     on the hook a.  The purpose of the game is to place
     all the discs on the peg c, in the same order by
     respecting both following constraints:

     - Move only a single disc at the same moment
     - Do not put a largest disc on one smaller one.

JC:  One asks to the participant to verbalize
     in order to say what he thinks what he is doing.
     The verbalizations are recorded and actions are noted.
     The aim is to reconstitute the strategy of problem solving
     from verbalizations and actions.

Let me try to explain why I am interested in this game,
to use that deceptively simple word "game" in the way
of all familiar dissemblances that we language gamers
perform so competently if not always so critically or
reflectively.  This actual game of the Tower of Hanoi,
though I believe that I first learned of it under the
name of the Temple of Benares, was one of my favorites
in a long ago time and a faraway galaxy, and I learned
it so well that I would entertain friends and strangers
with going through the moves in perfect order, one step
per heartbeat, with eyes blindfolded.  But people being
fickle as people will be, were not entertained for long,
if they ever were, and, after a while, no longer was I.
But still there is something about this game that tugs
at my attention, and so I must try to account for it.

Perhaps it is this.  I still maintain a general interest in all aspects
of the variety of activity that we have come to call "problem-solving".
Indeed, now that I think of it, I place this species of activity that
is problem-solving under the more generic heading of "inquiry", and
I consider it to be one of the two chief moieties of the main genus.

|                  Inquiry

|                   /   \  
|                  /     \
|    Intention    /       \   Expectation
|       and      *         *      and
|   Observation /           \ Observation
|              /             \
|             /               \
|            /                 \
|           o                   o
|   Problem-Resolving    Surprise-Resolving
|       Requires              Requires
|    Plan Of Action         Explanation

Now, since I regard the long term game of building
a "Testable Ontological Hierarchy" (TOH') as one
that falls under the generic heading of inquiry,
that is, I see it as a "mediate end result" (MER)
of an ongoing process, and neither as an absolute
beginning nor as an absolute completeness, even
when it appears to be "done" for the time being,
this means that the specific study of problems
and the methods of solving is very relevant to
the game of ontology building, and, of course,
the study of well-chosen concrete examples is
a natural part of any generally grounded study.

I hope that this serves to e-lucidate the overall "propositional altitude"
from which I view this particular game within the setting of a larger one.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
