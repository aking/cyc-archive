Dear Pat, may I try to increase our mutual understanding?

My overall comment is that I believe the scope of the SUO requires us to
relate it in some way or other to the real world, whatever that may be,
else how does it ever get to be useful.  If you don't like the way I am
trying to do it, do have any alternative proposal?

I have inserted more detailed comments below, MK&gt;

Yours, Martin

&gt;Pat, may I yet again suggest we can avoid a lot of problems if we are
clear
&gt;and consistent about whether we use any particular term to refer to the
&gt;real world or to a representation.

By all means, but I wonder if you and I agree on quite what these
terms mean. I havn't been talking about representations at all;
relations are things in the semantics. (I do sometimes slip and
forget to say 'symbol' in 'relation symbol', mea culpa.)

MK&gt; I hope we could understand each other better if we could agree.  If I
suggest real world corresponds with Peirce's firstness, does this help you
understand what I mean?  If so, what would you call secondness or
thirdness?  It would also help me if you could clarify what you mean by
"things in the semantics"; in particular the semantics of what.

&gt;In particular I use the word relation only to refer to a representation of
&gt;the real world, and in conformity with Ted Codd's definition.

MK&gt; Perhaps I should have used two separate sentences here.  I did not mean
Ted Codd defined relation to be a representation of the real world.  In
fact, he defined it much as you do below.  He (and I) then applied the
concept as a way of representing things.

I'm not familiar with Ted Codd's work, but this isnt the sense in
which the term is used throughout mathematics and philosophy, and I'm
afraid that I would find it impossible to adapt to this usage.

MK&gt; See above and below.

&gt;As such, I
&gt;see no problem in it only being a table of surrogates.  Conversely I use
&gt;the word relationship only to refer to the thing in the real world made up
&gt;of arbitrary entites.

I am not sure quite what y'all consider to be "in the real world"
here. There is a very good sense in which the actual world consists
of nothing but stuff arranged in space and time, for example. Sorry
if I seem to be very academic and persnickety, but I tend to agree
with John Sowa that talk about what is 'real' is rather dangerous in
these contexts. I really do not know whether sets are 'real' in the
sense that, say, my desk is. They certainly arent *physically* real.
But I don't really care, either; my point about 'surrogates' is just
that sets can be sets of anything. The real things are the things in
the sets, not the sets themselves.

MK&gt; It seems to me that the scope of the SUO requires us to relate it in
some way or other to the real world, whatever that may be, else how does it
ever get to be useful.  If you don't like the way I am trying to do it, do
have any alternative proposal?

&gt;In my experience, every relationship in the real world of whatever
&gt;arbitrary entities can be adequately represented using one or more
&gt;relations with suitable surrogates in its columns.

Well now, that is obviously wrong. There are certainly relations that
cannot be represented using tables of surrogates: for example, the
property of being an uncomputable number, or indeed *any* interesting
arithmetic relation (such as addition). But more concretely, consider
the fact that there are galaxies we can see but we cannot see any of
the stars in them, and consider the relation (in the real, real
world) of being a star in a galaxy. You can't adequately represent
that one with a table of surrogates since we havnt got any surrogates
for all those invisible stars.

MK&gt; It all depends on how we define relationship (which you agree below is
not defined in mathematics in the way relation is).  If I have identified a
particular star, and I have identified a particular galaxy, and I have
evidence that that star is in that galaxy, I call that an instance of a
relationship in the real world that I would like to represent in some way
in a model.  I believe asserting the existance of a tuple in a relation (or
adding a row to a table) is a good way to do this.  This may be useful
however many other stars, galaxies, and relationships between them may or
may not exist or be represented by other tuples.  I think your examples
(especially addition) are precisely why using the mathematical term
relation as if it were a synonym for relationship as used in natural
language to describe real world situations leads to high risk of confusion.

&gt;Does this help?

Er...I didnt feel like I needed any help on this particular topic. A
relation is a set of tuples. Relations have been sets of tuples since
I was an undergraduate math major, and they will go on being sets of
tuples. Its hard to think of anything clearer than that.

MK&gt; Your definition of relation is the way Ted Codd used it and I agree
with. I am, and in this context I believe Ted Codd is, an applied
mathematician. That is, having some established mathematical results, we
seek to apply them to some real problem.

&gt;Incidently, while I agree that the word relation is well defined in
&gt;symbolic logic and relational databases, I am not aware of the same being
&gt;true of the word relationship.

No, it isn't, you are right. I will avoid using it for just that
reason, in fact.

MK&gt; Please carry on preferring relation when what you are talking about is
the mathematical concept.  Please also consider if some different (and not
necessarily precisely defined) word like relationship is more appropriate
when you are trying to refer explicitly to things like stars, galaxies, and
other observable phenomena.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Graham and Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To avoid endless problems caused by mismatched definitions,
&gt; &gt;I suggest that we adopt the following equivalences between
&gt; &gt;terms:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. The terms "relation" and "relationship" in ordinary
&gt; &gt;    English have multiple meanings.  But the use in both
&gt; &gt;    symbolic logic and in relational databases is firmly
&gt; &gt;    established.  I recommend that we restrict all uses
&gt; &gt;    of those two words to the meanings in logic and RDBMS.
&gt;
&gt;I'm happy with that. That was my point about relations being
&gt;identical to their extensions (as far as logic is concerned.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. In RDB, a relation is defined by a table.  The number
&gt; &gt;    of columns in the table is critical:  a binary or dyadic
&gt; &gt;    relation has two columns, a ternary or triadic relation
&gt; &gt;    has three columns, etc.  Each row of the table is
&gt; &gt;    called a tuple or a relationship.
&gt;
&gt;In (old) KIF, one could also have mixed-arity 'tables', so I wouldnt
&gt;say that the number was *critical* exactly. But I'm just quibbling.
&gt;More seriously (and this gets back to the old disagreement between us
&gt;which arose again recently). I'm a bit unhappy about identifying a
&gt;relation with a 'table', since "table" suggests something that could
&gt;be stored in a computer, ie a datastructure of some kind. But as long
&gt;as we allow 'tables' that can be made up af arbitrary entities (and
&gt;not just 'surrogates') then I agree, this is a useful metaphor for
&gt;thinking about extensional relations.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;......
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The words "property" and "attribute" have been used in many
&gt; &gt;confusing ways.  I suggest that we use them only as synonyms
&gt; &gt;for monadic (or unary) predicate.
&gt;
&gt;I agree. This is the only sense of them that I intend to use.
&gt;
&gt;Pat
