&gt; 
&gt; Dear Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree strongly with what you say below. This is not a matter of
&gt; philosophy, it is a matter of project management. Put simply: 
&gt; "failing to
&gt; plan is planning to fail." I am also reminded that: "Those who ignore
&gt; history are doomed to repeat it".
&gt; 
&gt; The implications of what you say below are:

I don't see that these implications can be drawn from my comments, and my
reasoning follows.

&gt; 
&gt;  - it is alright if the SUO is inconsistent and patchy

I think the final SUO standard would be a failure if it were contradictory
and/or patchy.  However, it seems to me to be an inescapable fact of life
that the first few drafts of an initial working paper are going to contain
some inconsistencies and gaps.  My hope is that we can iron out the
contradictions and fill in the gaps through many iterations of
comment/response.

&gt;  - it is alright if we can't answer the question "why does it 
&gt; look like this"

But we can explain why the current version of the merged ontology looks the
way it does.  I have distributed on several occasions the methodology that I
followed in putting together the first two versions of the ontology.
Changes to these versions will be a product of iterations of
comment/response, and there will always be the list archive to explain why
any particular change or addition was made to the ontology.  Aside from all
of this, it seems to be that the main justification of any engineering
artifact, including an ontology, is a pragmatic one.  If it allows you to
accomplish something in less time or at a reduced cost, then that's why the
engineering artifact looks the way it does.

&gt;  - it is alright if we have no philosophical foundation at all

I'm not sure what you mean by a "philosophical foundation".  If you mean a
metaphysics/epistemology that catalogues the primitive entities in the
world, analyzes complex concepts in terms of these primitive entities, and
shows how we can mentally apprehend these entities and concepts, that's
certainly something that would be nice to have.  However, it is unreasonable
to expect that we will be able to develop such a metaphysics/epistemology in
this context.  There is no agreement within the philosophical community on
any proposition within metaphysics or epistemology, and I think it would be
the height of hubris to claim that we're going to make progress where Plato,
Descartes, Wittgenstein, et al failed. 

&gt; 
&gt; Regards

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	Here is my response to the criticism that we need to 
&gt; &gt; get clear about
&gt; &gt; foundations/methodology before proceeding to the development 
&gt; &gt; of an actual
&gt; &gt; ontology.  It seems to me that the 2,500 year history of 
&gt; &gt; philosophy is a
&gt; &gt; fairly powerful argument against this approach.  Although 
&gt; &gt; philosophy is a
&gt; &gt; great source of stimulating debate and theoretical insight, 
&gt; &gt; one would be
&gt; &gt; hard-pressed to point to anything on which a majority of 
&gt; &gt; philosophers agree.
&gt; &gt; Furthermore, I think that theoretical discussion is most 
&gt; &gt; useful when it is
&gt; &gt; grounded in a concrete fabric within which this discussion 
&gt; &gt; has a context and
&gt; &gt; an application.  I would argue that the best way of obtaining 
&gt; &gt; consensus is
&gt; &gt; to produce an initial document (no matter how flawed) and 
&gt; &gt; then to revise it
&gt; &gt; over many, many iterations of criticism and comment.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; A number of people made similar comments:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Robert E. Kent (rekent@ontologos.org)stated: 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	"As with several other people, I also believe that much 
&gt; &gt; &gt; more work is
&gt; &gt; &gt; needed on foundations and methodology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	"I do believe that Ian's doc. is worth developing (and his newer
&gt; &gt; &gt; version is
&gt; &gt; &gt; a good improvement). Despite this fact, I think this group 
&gt; &gt; has to keep
&gt; &gt; &gt; working on the "general picture" before focussing on (this or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; other) base
&gt; &gt; &gt; documents. I understand that concrete results would speed up 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the process,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but at this early stage I see it as a mistake."
