Chris,

Thanks for the efforts at putting together this draft.  It is very useful,
and clear enough that I was able to isolate things I didn't understand,
and, perhaps, start to understand them.  I have a few comments, and a
paraphrase of some of it, based on my attempts to sort some things out that
weren't clear to me.  Others have made similar comments in some cases.
There is so much mail on this, that I can't attribute everything to its
originator.

1. Reference numbers, and KIF global syntax.

It appears that there is a global syntax convention that (discussion "xxx")
preceeds the actual axiom, theorem, or definition that is being discussed.
Can we count on this?  (If this is docmumented, I missed it.)  If so, this
might be a good place to start putting in reference identifiers of some
kind.  Of course, putting reference identifiers on material that is in an
early stage of development has a lot of problems, but it certainly would
facilitate discussion.

2.  Time.  I understand that, at this level, this ontology is supposed to
be time neutral (3d 4d).  Some people may have a problem with this;  on the other
hand, I agree with the approach of keeping things time and space neutral at
this level.  But it is hard to think this way.

3. Some confusion results from the order in which things are presented, and
lack of clear statements as to what is primative.   Some things that are
stated as axioms or theorems seem to either be or need definitions.
Perhaps they are there but I haven't found them.  The theorem on unions of
classes struck me as lacking a definition of union -- but I found it
later on.   I'm still looking for the definition of 'empty.'

4. There is a level of abstraction (or something!) here that I had trouble
with---not wrong, just confusing to the unwary.  Like Matthew, I was
stopped for a good long time over (class relation).   This may be clear to
those who have been thinking about ontology in a certain way for some time,
but some of us need help!  (I'm glad to see from the mail that I'm not the
only one.)


5. Well, to help sort out whether or not I'm on the right track, here is a
paraphrase of some of the content.  Any corrections or objections
will be appreciated.

I'll try to do some KIF, but ...

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;  Primatives
;;
;;  The language includes (in addition to the bare KIF syntax)
;;  logical connectives, and the following primatives:
;;
;;  relation
;;
;;  instance-of
;;
;;  particular
;;
;;  -- I've thrown in the term 'particular' since particulars seem to be
;;  lurking
;;  in the background.  I'm not sure this is essential at this stage, but
;;  I'm more comfortable including them.
;;
;;  Well formed expressions --
;;  We need to know that if (relation ?rel) then (?rel @args) is well
;; formed if and only if @args has one or more entries.  I don't know how
;; to do this, so having noted it, I'm going to gloss over it.

(documentation "Axiom: only relations can be truly predicated of other
things")
(forall (?r @args)
     (=&gt; (?r @args)
         (relation ?r)))


(documentation "AXIOM:  instance-of is an instance of relation")
(instance-of instance-of relation)

(documentation "AXIOM:  particular is an instance of relation")
(instance-of particular relation)

(documentation "AXIOM:  relation is an instance of  relation")
(instance-of relation relation)

(documentation "AXIOM:  Everything is either a relation or a particular")

(forall (?x) (or ((relation ?x) (particular ?x))

(documentation "AXIOM:  Nothing is both a relation and a particular")

(forall (?x) (not
               (and (relation ?x)  (particular ?x))))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;  It is unclear to me why unary and binary were given as AXIOMS rather
;;  than as DEFINITIONS.   It seems to me they should be defined.
;;  Alternatively, one makes these primative terms, and then gives AXIOMS.
;;  BUt why not just define them?
;;
;;  In either case, at this point in the development we can
;;  go from here to a definiton (or axiomatization?) of arity of relations,
;;  and the other definitions and theorems in the section on BASIC RELATION
;;  THEORY  (except, of course, those that refer to classes).
;;
;;   I think the following are axioms:
(documentation "AXIOM  relation is a unary relation")
(unary relation)

(documentation "AXIOM  particular is a unary relation")
(unary particular)

(documentation "AXIOM instance-of is a binary relation")
;;
;;   Assuming that has been done:
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;;

(documentation "DEFINITION:  empty.  A relation is empty if it has no
instances")

(forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
     (&lt;=&gt; (empty ?rel)
          (not (exists (@args) (?rel @args)))))

(documentation "DEFINITION:  A class is a unary relation")

(forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
     (&lt;=&gt; (class ?rel) (unary ?rel) ) )

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Now the material on classes is largely covered by the material on
relations.  Of course subclasses can be introduced.

I hope I'm on more or less the right track.

I heartily recommend trying to write some KIF as an aid to
learning the language.

Best regards,

John Velman
