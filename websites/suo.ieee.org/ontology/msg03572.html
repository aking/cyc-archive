JA: 2.1  A Functional Conception of Quantification Theory
    Up till now quantification theory has been based on the assumption of
    individual variables ranging over universal collections of perfectly
    determinate elements.  Merely to write down quantified notations like
    &quot;(For All)_(x in X) F(x)&quot; and &quot;(For Some)_(x in X) F(x)&quot; involves a
    subscription to notions of this order, as certified in the membership
    relations that are exhibited in their indices.  Reflected on pragmatic
    insights and constructive principles, however, these ideas begin to
    appear as problematic hypotheses whose warrants to be admitted are
    not beyond question, as projects of exhaustive determination that
    overreach the powers of finite information and control to manage.

CM: The assumption of the determinateness of objects in most ontologies
    is a workable idealization, unproblematic in most cases.

Yes, this issue is difficult to express correctly, and I can see
that this statement from my juvenenilia of six years ago does not
quite come up to my current standards of juvenilia, but with a bit
of charity in the interpretation it still reads more or less right
to a non-stranger such as I.  So let me try to clarify it further.

The question is not the &quot;determinateness&quot; of objects in our ontologies,
if by that you mean a proper property of the objects in and of themselves.

What I am trying to highlight when I point to the &quot;assumption of individual
variables ranging over universal collections of perfectly determinate elements&quot;
is a 3-adic relation among signs (in this case variables), properties (taken in
extension as a universe and its subsets), and objects (elements of the universe).
The way I understand it, &quot;determination&quot; is an attribute of this relation and of
its 3-adic transactions that cannot be further abstracted, detached, prescinded,
or whatever, from this 3-dim frame of reference, and still make determinate sense.
It's a very relativistic angle on things.

The assumption that I am trying to relativize here is one
that is very problematic in practice, and in all but the
most &quot;idealized&quot;, that is, &quot;logic textbook&quot; cases.

CM: Moreover, often as not, it's no idealization at all.  The objects in an ontology
    for aircraft maintenance, for example, are *extremely* well-defined and determinate.

You are talking like someone who has never done a real inventory of a warehouse.
Of course, objects in themselves are &quot;extremely&quot; well-defined and determinate.
Heck, we know their kilogrammage, their atomic mass, their atomic number --
just one problem -- where the hell is all that missing plutonium!

No doubt you are getting ready to lecture me on the disentanglement
of epistemology and ontology.  Well, I already know how to split
that particular hairy atom.  It's just the difference between:

Epi.  We 'know' the missing plutonium has got to be somewhere.
Ont.  We know the missing plutonium has got to 'be' somewhere.

CM: How about you talk less and give some real world examples that illustrate
    how your &quot;pragmatic insights&quot; and &quot;constructive principles&quot; -- whatever
    those are -- show how the assumption of determinateness turns out to
    be a &quot;problematic hypothesis&quot;?

I have trouble thinking of any real problems where it isn't a problem.
What I don't quite understand is why you can't seem to think of any.

JA: Therefore, it is worth considering how we might opt to shift the
    foundations of quantification theory closer to familiar ground,
    namely, toward the predicates themselves that represent our
    continuing acquaintance with phenomena.

CM: I don't see why any problems of indeterminateness that
    might plague quantification theory wouldn't reappear
    immediately in the problem of indeterminateness of
    predicate application.  Indeed, it seems to me the
    problem is far greater there -- we don't have any
    problem quantifying over a class of persons, but
    there may be a lot of indeterminateness about
    which members of that class the predicate
    &quot;Adult&quot; applies to.

Oh, okay, I see that you are simply reading me backwards again.
I am assuming that predicates (proparties, weaves, modes ...) are
always kinda hazy, and I am saying that we are kidding ourselves
if we think that subjects (indivisuals, parsicles, nodes ...) are
not potentially just as much so, or modally distinct only in degree,
not essence.  I am not looking for a way to escape this parsicular
inevitability, merely trying to hack out a calculus that can help
us account for it and to cope with it as best we can.  Clearer?
