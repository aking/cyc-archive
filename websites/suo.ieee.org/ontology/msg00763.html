&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Matthew,  you are too kind in your grading!
&gt; 
&gt; Let me once again try to capture your POV as briefly as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. A spatio-temporal object (alias a spatio-temporal extent) 
&gt; is something
&gt; in the real world, and can be represented at as a whole by a constant.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. An activity is something in the real world.  An activity 
&gt; is involved in
&gt; actual relationships but they are not the activity.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent (you believe that 
&gt; this follows
&gt; from 1 &amp; 2, but see below).
&gt; 
&gt; 4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the 
&gt; real world, but
&gt; if you are qualified to study advanced topics you may wish to consider
&gt; representations of relations in the real world)
&gt; 
&gt; 5. From 1 and 3 it follows that an Activity can be modelled 
&gt; as a whole by a
&gt; constant. The relationships of an activity can be modeled by relations
&gt; containing that constant.  The example is modelled using 
&gt; multiple dyadic
&gt; and triadic relations.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Attempting to model activities as a single n-adic relation may be
&gt; adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
&gt; between systems, and by implication for the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; Whether 3 follows from 1 &amp; 2 depends on whether or not 
&gt; anything other than
&gt; spatio-temporal extents can be in the real world.  Elsewhere you said
&gt; "Actual relationships exist in the same way that actual 
&gt; classes do. They
&gt; are abstract objects that are out there that we can take an 
&gt; interest in and
&gt; use to organise and think about the world.".  This suggests you do
&gt; recognize things other than spatio-temporal extents in the 
&gt; real world.  It
&gt; follows there needs to be some justification why an activity is a
&gt; spatio-temporal extent and not anything else.
&gt; 
&gt; Please can you specify what other things you do recognize in 
&gt; the real world
&gt; at the same sort of meta-level as spatio-temporal extents, 
&gt; idealy with a
&gt; specific example (like Activity) of each.

MW: Happy to oblige.

MW: In a 4D world, as I recall, I said that there exists a set for every
possible combination of things (including sets). The good news is that we
don't have to be interested in them. The ones we are interested in have some
significance and we give them a name and generally call them classes. These
are abstract objects and do not exist in (i.e. are independent of) space
time, but do exist in some sense. Relationships (actual or otherwise) are
the same. For every pair (triple, etc) of objects there is a relationship.
It is an abstract object, in that its existance is independent of space
time. Again the good news is that we don't have to be interested in many of
them. Those that we are interested in we put into relations (actual or not
as may be) i.e. we classify them. I rely here in part on the fact that
relations can be derived from sets.

MW: Now that is an exposition of the background. The important question is
what does that mean when I want to say, perhaps, that something was
purchased, say our lawnmower?

MW: There is an activity which we can denote by the constant a. A is a
member of the class Purchase, which is a subtype of activity. At the start
of the activity there is a spatio-temporal extent b that is classified as a
whole lawnmower (whole here indicates the spatio-temporal extent that is the
lawnmower for the whole of its life). More particularly there is a state of
this that is owned by a matching state of the person or company that owns
the lawnmower, in this case Carter's. There is a timeless ownership
relationship between these two spatio-temporal extents (all the time
elements are in the states that are related, so the relationship is always
true and timeless). The purchase activity causes the termination of the
state of the lawnmower that was owned by Carter's, and the start of the
state of the lawnmower that is owned by me. The event(s) are the temporal
boundary of the states and are at a point in time. Whether there is a gap
between the ownership states is arbitrary.

MW: What you will notice is that what I am describing here is somewhat more
precise than what is normally represented. This is why I say that a 4D
ontology is well placed to define and interrelate other ontologies, which is
where my primary interest lies.
&gt; 
&gt; My only other comment at this stage is that, while I am happy to see a
&gt; constant in some sense as a surrogate for something as a 
&gt; whole, I see no
&gt; way of thinking or talking about e.g. an activity as 
&gt; meaningful, without
&gt; seeing the actual relationships as part of it.  I see this as 
&gt; a matter of
&gt; interpretation and not an inconsistency.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you will agree with me that the answer to the original 
&gt; question "Is
&gt; an activity a relation?" is, in this context, an emphatic no, 
&gt; because the
&gt; activity is in the real world and the relation is a 
&gt; representation.  The
&gt; six points above are an answer to what might have been the 
&gt; real question
&gt; "Can an activity be represented by a relation?".
&gt; 
&gt; I have trimmed some of the tail of this exchange.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew, thanks for this. Trying to capture your POV again:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. A spatio-temporal object (alias a spatio-temporal extent)
&gt; &gt; is something
&gt; &gt; in the real world, and can be represented at least in part by
&gt; &gt; a constant.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I would say it represents the whole of the activity, i.e. it is a
&gt; surrogate for it. The constant does not represent the 
&gt; relationships the
&gt; activity has, but then the relationships the activity has are not the
&gt; activity in the real world either.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. An activity is something in the real world.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Therefore.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the
&gt; &gt; real world, but
&gt; &gt; if you are qualified to study advanced topics you may wish 
&gt; to consider
&gt; &gt; representations of relations in the real world)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5. From 1 and 3 it follows that an Activity can be modelled
&gt; &gt; in part by a
&gt; 
&gt; MW: in whole rather than in part.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; constant. An activity can be modeled more fully by the union
&gt; &gt; of a constant
&gt; &gt; and relations containing that constant.  The example is 
&gt; modelled using
&gt; &gt; multiple dyadic and triadic relations.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: The relations represent the actual relationships of the 
&gt; activity, not
&gt; the activity (see above). It is worth noting that in KIF constants are
&gt; declared implicity, not explcity, so you do not come across a constant
&gt; until
&gt; you want to say something about it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 6. Attempting to model a activities as a single n-adic 
&gt; relation may be
&gt; &gt; adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
&gt; &gt; between systems, and by implication for the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Correct.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note that I have followed my principle of trying to use the
&gt; &gt; singular case
&gt; &gt; (e.g. Activity rather than Activities).  I find this is a
&gt; &gt; very powerful aid
&gt; &gt; to achieving precision.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: My preference too. some times I am sloppy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can I ever hope for alpha-plus?  Yours, Martin
&gt; 
&gt; MW: We are well into alpha-plus territory here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; ============================================
&gt; Dear Martin,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Actual relationships exist in the same way that actual
&gt; &gt; &gt; classes do. They are
&gt; &gt; &gt; abstract objects that are out there that we can take an
&gt; &gt; &gt; interest in and use
&gt; &gt; &gt; to organise and think about the world. Actual relationships
&gt; &gt; &gt; are what one
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing has to do with another. I note that a relation like:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;purchase, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th 
&gt; August 1999&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; does not represent a relationship, but actually a number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships
&gt; &gt; &gt; that each element of this construct has to an object that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; not part of,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but may be inferred from this construct.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So in analysis I look for recognition of this. I would
&gt; &gt; &gt; analyse the above
&gt; &gt; &gt; into:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Purchase a&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Purchaseof a b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;Datetimeof a 12:15-12th-August-1999&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;lawnmower b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;HondaCB250 b&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;hasprice HondaCB250 c&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;GBPvaluemap c 500&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or something similar. So I have extracted and represented 
&gt; the actual
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that there is anything wrong with the original data
&gt; &gt; structure in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; purchasing system, but you do have to extract what it means
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you are to
&gt; &gt; &gt; make that available without everyone having to learn the
&gt; &gt; &gt; language of every
&gt; &gt; &gt; other system.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does this provide an answer?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt; &gt;       Matthew
&gt; &gt; &gt; ============================================
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear John,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This doesn't help us much. In particular it doesn;t answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started with, which is "Is an activity a relation?" where at
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least Pat,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chris P and I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would feel uncompfortable that a relation was a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent. On
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hand many others note that activities are frequently
&gt; &gt; modelled as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relations. Perhaps it is OK to do both, in which case is this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inconsistent?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or does it just not matter?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Matthew
