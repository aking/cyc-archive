John,

Thanks very much for your comments. I agree with everything you say, of
course.

Regarding terminology, the terms "regular" and "irregular" are somewhat
neutral and descriptive, while "natural" and "technical" may be confusing
since, as you point out, scientists try to develop technical definitions /
descriptions for natural concepts like "space", "time", etc. However, I
would not object to using the terms "natural" and "technical" in this way.

Another terminology that is used in the literature is, of course,
"classical" vs. "family resemblance" category.

One paper I find very interesting on this subject is:

Pinker, Steven &amp; Prince, Alan (1999) "The nature of human concepts: evidence
from an unusual source", in the book "Language, Logic, and Concepts: Essays
in Memory of John Macnamara", edited by Jackendoff, Bloom &amp; Wynn, MIT Press.

This paper analyzes regular and irregular verb classes, in relation to
classical and family resemblance categories in cognitive psychology, and
argues that the parallels may not be accidental, but an indication that
humans need to think and represent the world using both kinds of categories.
It is based on this paper that I have tended to use the terms "regular" and
"irregular" to talk about classes and categories in general, though the
paper is clear to use both terminologies carefully.

Whatever terminology we choose, the point seems clear that we should
consider developing a "heterogenous concept representation" framework.

"... What is meant by a true and natural class? [...] my opinion is that it
is a shallow and sciolistic metaphysics which declares a "real class," in
the sense which those writers attach to the term, to be an impossible thing.
At the same time, I am unable to see any need at all in positive science for
considering such metaphysically real classes. To my apprehension the
business of classification has no concern with them, but only with true and
natural classes, in another and a purely experiential sense. For example, if
I were to attempt to classify the arts, which I shall not do, I should have
to recognize, as one of them, the art of illumination, and should have
occasion to remark that lamps form a true, real, and natural class, because
every lamp has been made and has come into being as a result of an aim
common and peculiar to all lamps. A class, of course, is the total of
whatever objects there may be in the universe which are of a certain
description. ..." - CSP, CP1:204

&gt; Subject: SUO: Re: Irregular concepts
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I sympathize with Phil Jackson's goal, but I don't like the terms
&gt; "regular" and "irregular":
&gt;
&gt; &gt; One other point to make is that the concept of "contest" is related to
&gt; &gt; "game", which many people (Wittgenstein, Rosch, Lakoff, ...) argue is an
&gt; &gt; "irregular concept", i.e. not susceptible to a single, logical
&gt; definition,
&gt; &gt; and needing to some extent to be described by a collection of examples,
&gt; &gt; exceptions, prototypes, etc. This ties in with the ideas of mining
&gt; &gt; ontologies, and describing ontologies via associations,
&gt; ontology maps, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To better represent the range of real world concepts, we may
&gt; need to develop
&gt; &gt; a framework for "heterogenous concept representation", which allows
&gt; &gt; intermixing regular and irregular concept definitions, i.e. giving a
&gt; &gt; definition / description of a (regular / irregular) concept in terms of
&gt; &gt; other concepts, each of which may be regular or irregular. Such
&gt; a framework
&gt; &gt; may also need to allow use of metaphorical mechanisms to define
&gt; / describe
&gt; &gt; new concepts in terms of others.
&gt;
&gt; As more accurate terms for describing the two kinds of concepts,
&gt; I would suggest "natural" and "technical".  Wittgenstein's point
&gt; was that *every* naturally occurring concept is irregular in the
&gt; above sense, and that the only terms that are not irregular are
&gt; the ones that have been artificially defined for a particular
&gt; technical purpose.
&gt;
&gt; Even in science (including mathematics and computer technology)
&gt; most terms are "natural" or "irregular" except when they are
&gt; formally defined for a specific purpose, whose scope lasts
&gt; only for the duration of a single book, article, manual,
&gt; or computer program.
&gt;
&gt; As examples, consider the terms "space" and "time" in ordinary
&gt; language, Newtonian mechanics, Einstein's relativity, and more
&gt; recent theories of cosmology.  People who have taken a course in
&gt; physics often equate Newtonian "absolute time" with "common sense",
&gt; but Newton himself had to argue against the "relativistic time",
&gt; which he believed was "common among the vulgar".  But what Newton
&gt; considered "vulgar" is today considered "advanced physics", and
&gt; most of the people in the world (considering the so called third
&gt; world nations as the majority) have concepts of time that are
&gt; very different from the ones that are "common sense" for people
&gt; who have grown up with clocks and schedules.
&gt;
&gt; In mathematics, consider the concept of "number", whose definition
&gt; has gone through many twists and turns in mathematics books over the
&gt; past 2500 years and took even more radical twists and turns during
&gt; the 20th century, especially in the latter half with all of the many
&gt; different definitions that have cropped up in computer systems.
&gt;
&gt; I was recently looking at a book about SQL (the O'Reilly book
&gt; _SQL in a Nutshell_), which included a comparison of the definitions
&gt; of datatypes (including numbers) in the SQL92 standard, the SQL99
&gt; standard, and four different implementations of SQL, none of which
&gt; exactly conformed to the definitions in either of the two "standards".
&gt;
&gt; If physicists can't agree on a single definition of "space" and
&gt; "time" and mathematicians can't agree on a single definition
&gt; of "number", it is very difficult to imagine any concepts that
&gt; might be called "regular".
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; PS:  This discussion, by the way, is a brief version of one of the
&gt; main themes of Chapter 6 (on Knowledge Soup) in my KR book.
