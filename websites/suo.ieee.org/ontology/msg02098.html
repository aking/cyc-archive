&gt;Aldo,
&gt;
&gt;Pat objected to the word "intended" (which I consider something
&gt;that can only be inferred, at best approximately, from context).
&gt;But I also object to the word "average", which seems to imply
&gt;some kind of context-independent meaning.
&gt;I don't believe that the range of meanings of a word is
&gt;arbitrary, but I don't believe in an "average" meaning
&gt;that is independent of context.

John, either you think that intentions can only be inferred and do
not pertain to ontology, or you think that ontology considers only
some shared intentions and neutralizes contexts. But you can hardly claim
context dependency together with intention elimination.

&gt;  &gt;IMO, what computational ontology (as far as lexical items are
&gt;&gt;concerned) is trying to do is formally approximating the
&gt;&gt;conceptualization that an average reader from our current dominant
&gt;&gt;(or shared) culture assumes when reading a lexical item. In other
&gt;&gt;words, only some possible models for a lexical item are committed to
&gt;&gt;in a given ontology. The more general an ontology claims to be, the
&gt;&gt;more it assumes the conceptualization of that average reader
&gt;&gt;independently of any context of use. The more domain-oriented an
&gt;&gt;ontology is, the more it describes the conceptualization of an
&gt;&gt;average reader for a restricted community or context.
&gt;
&gt;As an example, consider the following sentence:
&gt;
&gt;    "Mary had a little lamb."
&gt;
&gt;Then consider the following three continuations:
&gt;
&gt;  1. "Its fleece was white as snow."
&gt;
&gt;  2. "The rice was white as snow."
&gt;
&gt;  3. "The doctors were amazed"
&gt;
&gt;In context #1, she was playing with her pet; in #2, she
&gt;was eating it; and in #3, she was giving birth to it.

Lexical meaning and sentential meaning are different matters. 
Sentential meaning is much more context-dependent, but depends on the 
lexical meaning of the items the sentence is composed of.
On the other hand, the main relevance of context for sentential 
meaning is not that involved in your example, but rather the possible 
connotations given by the speakers in a certain situation (e.g., the 
affective value of that lamb for Mary, the fact that Mary haven't 
ever eaten lamb until some rice was put within, the strange calm with 
which Mary gave birth to the lamb, etc.).
In your example - apart connotations - the role of context is in 
disambiguating the lexical meaning of 'have', one of the most 
polysemous verbs in English (WordNet gives 21 entries).
You could use a WordNet-based ontology library including a definition 
(more probably, an axiomatic description) of 11 shared average 
conceptualizations of 'little', 4 'of 'lamb',  21 of 'have', some of 
&lt;past tense&gt;, some of 'a' (indefinite article). That is all for 
ontology. If you want to analyze sentential meaning, you have to 
exploit ontologies, but they only provide a network of lexical 
meanings. Then you need a parser, a co-occurrence analyzer, an 
abductive inferential engine to check the possible representations of 
the sentential meaning compared to the topic of the text, etc.

&gt;  &gt; In this
&gt;&gt;perspective, intentions are not _disturbing_ or _dangerous_ to
&gt;&gt;computational ontology per se, but they should be _neutralized_ under
&gt;&gt;certain conditions in order to give machines something that they can
&gt;&gt;share with humans.
&gt;
&gt;I don't believe that intentions are dangerous or disturbing,
&gt;and I certainly don't believe that they should be neutralized.
&gt;I don't believe that anyone (human or machine) can ever know
&gt;someone else's intentions exactly, but I do believe that both
&gt;humans and machines can infer a great deal about them from
&gt;context (although humans are certainly better at it than
&gt;most current computer systems).

Yes, but part of this job is not ontological.

&gt;There is a lot more to be said, but to be brief, I believe
&gt;that something along the lines of Wittgenstein's language
&gt;games is the way to go -- both for average human beings in
&gt;so-called "average" situations and for the most esoteric
&gt;specialists in any field.
&gt;
&gt;In fact, I agree with the anthropologist Clifford Geertz,
&gt;who observed that anybody who does not belong to one's
&gt;immediate group is, in some respect, "exotic":
&gt;
&gt;    "The problem of how a Copernican understands a Ptolemaian,
&gt;    a fifth republic Frenchman an _ancien regime_ one, or a poet
&gt;    a painter is seen to be on all fours with the problem of
&gt;    how a Christian understands a Muslim, a European an Asian,
&gt;    an anthropologist an aborigine, or vice versa.  We are all
&gt;    natives now, and everybody else not immediately one of us
&gt;    is an exotic.  What looked once to be a matter of finding
&gt;    out whether savages could distinguish fact from fancy now
&gt;    looks to be a matter of finding out how others, across the
&gt;    sea or down the corridor, organize their significative world.
&gt;
