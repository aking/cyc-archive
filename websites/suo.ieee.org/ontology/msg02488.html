Adam and Pat,

To answer Adam's question:

AP&gt; Then, without picking a particular working document for the group to
&gt; focus on, and with an average number of axioms under active discussion
&gt; averaging about 1 per month, how are we to make progress on
&gt; axiomatizing an upper level?

I would like to adopt some of Pat's suggestions and arrange them
in a slightly different order:

PH&gt; But let me be the straw man. I will stake out a position and defend
&gt; it: the upper ontology is not irrelevant, but almost any upper
&gt; ontology does more harm than good. That is, almost any ontology could
&gt; be constructed more efficiently and with less work, if the highest
&gt; levels were stripped out or ignored, and then perhaps inserted after
&gt; the fact to 'fit' the middle-level concepts. The reason being that it
&gt; is essentially impossible to think of the necessary distinctions ab
&gt; initio, but that one must discover them by building nontrivial
&gt; axiomatic theories at the 'middle' levels first, and thereby
&gt; discovering the conceptual distinctions that provide the best
&gt; representational leverage.

I agree with this point.  In fact, that is how I formed the hierarchies
I presented in my KR book:  start with distinctions that are known to
be significant at many different levels (including some of the lowest
levels of the hiearchy) and form lattices as cross-products of the
lower-level distinctions.  What I called my "top level" is the product
of three important distinctions, but as I have said many times, I am
willing to negotiate on which distinctions are included.

&gt; Most of the high-level debates on this
&gt; list that have been of real ontological substance (eg the
&gt; continuant/occurrent debate, the relevance of 4-d spatiotemporal
&gt; frameworks) have been on issues that have already been distilled from
&gt; earlier middle-level work (in that case, an entire literature),

I agree.

&gt; most of those that have not been so distilled (eg almost everything
&gt; that is in any way associated with the intials CSP) have been an
&gt; entire waste of time and bandwidth.

I agree that a lot time and bandwidth have been wasted on a fruitless
effort to explain CSP's distinction.  However, CSP most definitely
distilled them from a very large number of lower-level observations.
I am working on a paper that will explain them better, but I don't
intend to waste time and bandwidth until my paper is done.

&gt; Meanwhile, the merged ontology
&gt; consists of an accumulation of middle-level theories being hung onto
&gt; a framework which was provided a priori rather than being abstracted
&gt; from the theories themselves (in direct opposition to the methodology
&gt; of the author of that heirarchy, by the way) and shows the resultant
&gt; conceptual strain at almost every point.

I agree.
 
&gt; I might add that this methodology is supported to some extent by
&gt; empirical work on concept mining, where a key strategy in identifying
&gt; useful conceptual dimensions is to find the ways that concepts can be
&gt; teased apart, ie how they differ as well as the ways they are
&gt; similar. The key question to ask is, given three concepts A, B and C:
&gt; in what way would B be closest to A and furthest from C? The point
&gt; being that this kind of analysis requires a level of detail which
&gt; only becomes apparent when one has a reasonable amount of particular
&gt; detailed knowledge to apply it to.

I agree.

AP&gt;&gt; The point is to pick one (or generate one) and move on, as
&gt;&gt;agonizing over the "one true ontology" is pointless.  I agree with
&gt;&gt;Doug whole-heartedly.
 
PH&gt; No, the point is to move on. The issue is not the one true ontology,
&gt; but the utility of ANY upper ontology. If the upper ontology is
&gt; really not that important, then why are we (you)  wasting so much
&gt; time building one? What utility is shared by *all* upper ontologies?

What I have been calling for is an upper level that is dynamically
created from whatever set of distinctions are in use.  I have repeatedly
cited examples taken from Wille &amp; Ganter's FCA work, in which a new
hierarchy, including upper, middle, and lower levels is created
at any time from any given set of distinctions just by pushing
a button.

And by the way, there are many other lattice-building methods
that should be considered.  The FCA is one example I am familiar
with, but there are others.  I am primarily arguing for lattice
building methods, not for any particular lattice.  Another very
important property of such automated methods is that there is no
need to prove consistency -- the method of construction guarantees
consistency.  That is by no means true of any hand-constructed
hierarchy (such as Cyc or the current merged ontology).

Bottom line:  I agree with Pat that the upper level should be
distilled from the lower level, but the process of creating
the full lattice should be done by an automated method.
