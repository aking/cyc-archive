Jon,

	Here's some more guidance, plus some other things we need to
resolve.

1. Cuteness has its place and time, but prolonged or misplaced, annoys:

	a. The message below was sent to the SUO list, but you have set
things up so it appears to be sent to the 'Subtly Unobtrusive Ontology'
list.  OK, cute, but old, so please change your system.  Also, I do
sometimes care which list this a message was sent to, so it does matter.

2. In your message below, you take 7 lines building up to your statement, 7
lines which say nothing of value to this group.

3. Your self-created acrnonyms serve no purpose and are annoying.  I suggest
you save your creativity for things that matter. 

4. Your suggestions for the two lists appear to be an attempt to be cute. I
see no serious purpose in this message, so please stop sending messages like
this.  

5. Your thread on 'Critique of Non....' has run for some time now.  Please
briefly summarize how it has, to date, contributed to the work of this
group.

	I would also like to politely remind you that we will need to
resolve most of these issues, or unless consensus arises to permit you to
continue, I WILL need to start moderating your postings.  I think this
discussion has been a valuable step, but I also don't see much change in
your actions.  I will hold off on my decision until Friday morning, so
please take these and my other messages seriously and try to resolve them
with me. We don't need to be completed by Friday, but I need to see solid
progress and genuine intent by then.

Jim

JA = Jon Awbrey
MW = Matthew West

MW: I would go for just 3 lists at present.

MW: SUO-Admin         - things like this discussion

MW: SUO-Standards     - for work on specific proposals
                        for starter documents
                        (might be split up later)
 
MW: SUO-Development   - for anything else.
 
JA: Maybe it's just the 3-adic thinker in me, but I actually kind of like
this one.
 
MW: However, I think we fool ourselves if we think this is just a matter of
mailing lists.
 
JA: I 2nd that e-motion.

After a week of merderously complex computation running
my &quot;content analytic cluster analysis&quot; (CACA) program
on the &quot;volume of messages in thread&quot; -- u do d'math --
and a careful consideration of the critical criteria,
I now feel adequately prepared to offer up as my final
suggestion the following &quot;imperative categorization&quot; (IC),
that we split the discussion list up in the following way:

0.  Discussions that address nothing but their
    own place in the imperative categorization.

1.  Discussions that address anything else.

I will leave it to the judgment of the &quot;ultimate community&quot; (UC)
to decide where the e-mediate discussation should have belonged.

Jon Awbrey
