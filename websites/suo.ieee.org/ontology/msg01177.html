Mike,

I'm inclined not to take another millisecond of the group's time on this.
However, you have asked me a direct and relevant question, so I'll try to
answer. People who have used up their millisecond may ignore this, if they
wish :-)

It seemed to me that "referent" was more general than "thing" or "entity".
"Thing" has the (admittedly, slight) disadvantage that one should explain it
is not necessarily a physical thing. This is a slight disadvantage because
people may customarily understand this anyway. "Thing" also has so many
definitions and usages that it is close to meaningless -- which in some ways
is an advantage for use as the supreme supertype...

Depending on how one defines "entity" it may also have a disadvantage. For
example, Webster's dictionary gives the following definition: "something
that has separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual
reality".

Suppose we are building a system that will extract information from news
stories across multiple domains. Conceivably such a system will need to
extract references to referents that do not exist, or exist only
hypothetically, such as counterfactual events, potential future situations
or events (e.g. a future recession or economic boom), the Higgs boson,
controlled fusion, etc. The system might also need to extract references
that occur to fictional characters, if only so that it can distinguish them
from real people. Thus a news extraction system might encounter a sentence
like "Santa Claus is sending droves of people to the stores this year." or
"The Grinch stole Christmas sales this year."

It all gets back to the scope, purpose, goals and requirements of a standard
upper ontology. Will SUO only refer to referents that we know exist?

Or if SUO is more broadly intended to support very general AI reasoning,
across multiple domains, then such a system might need an ontology that
would allow it to conceptualize to some degree about the non-existent. Of
course, we don't want our AI system going off into fantasyland.

The term "referent" could be used for all of these cases, plus things and
entities that exist. It also takes a step toward giving SUO a more explicit
semiotics, though both John Sowa and Jon Awbrey preferred other terms.

However, I agree with Pat Hayes that it does not make all that much
difference what term we use for the supreme supertype, though I think we
need to be as clear as possible about how the term is defined. E.g. we could
define "entity" differently, so that it does not imply existence, if that's
appropriate.

Or we could embed within the ontology ways of indicating existence and
non-existence -- If I understand correctly, this is what is done in John
Sowa's ontology, where the predicate Actuality() is used to indicate that
something exists, in which case existence would not be an attribute of the
supreme supertype. I'd welcome correction or clarification from John on this
point.

Or, maybe I have misunderstood the concept of what it means for the supreme
supertype to "exist". "Existence" has been bothering philosophers for a long
time, so I might have got this all wrong, and if so, I apologize, and
welcome enlightenment. (Now I've opened the door for another Awbrey
epistle... What's the ASCII code for existence?)

In any case, I continue to think it is important for people to continue
defining requirements and objectives for SUO.

&gt;
&gt; what is the advantage of referent over thing or entity? Are not thing and
&gt; entity also that which can be referenced?  I'm unclear on what the import
&gt; of this is.

&gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: In EPISTLE we modestly claim that the EPISTLE Core Model can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represent "life the universe and everything" (well almost).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: OK, how about the phrase "life, the universe and everything"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as another
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "challenge concept"? How would you represent this in EPISTLE?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Well I guess the simple answer is "thing" our supreme
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supertype. That of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course is the set of all things, which includes classes and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relations and so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PJ: OK, I'll accept this answer for "everything" :-)
&gt;
&gt; On further thought, I'd like to suggest a different possible name for the
&gt; supreme supertype, other than "thing" or "entity" which seem to be
&gt; traditional...
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps a better word for the supreme supertype could be
&gt; "referent", meaning
&gt; that which can be referenced.
&gt;
&gt; I'm thinking along the following lines: Whatever cannot be
&gt; referenced cannot
&gt; be described and hence cannot be categorized or placed in an ontology. Of
&gt; that which cannot be referenced, we must be silent...
&gt;
&gt; This is just a thought-- I am not dogmatic about it, and don't see it as a
&gt; major issue if people continue using "thing" or "entity" as the supreme
&gt; supertype. I'd be interested in people's responses pro or con.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
