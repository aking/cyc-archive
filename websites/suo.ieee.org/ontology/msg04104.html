<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;*The* most significant problem with this paradigm, however, is the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;development and application of mappings.&nbsp; What is &quot;mapping&quot;, really?&nbsp; Can </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;it be understood and taught to the general ontology-using public?&nbsp; Your </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;effort was successful because you were dealing with a closed system of a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;known and well-defined scope and data meanings.&nbsp; How can the mapping </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;lessons you learned (and were learned in the above efforts) be applied to </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;an open system with a huge, unknown, and constantly evolving scope and </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;fuzzy, ambiguous, context-sensitive data meanings?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; The mapping problem is significant, to be sure, but is a problem in any </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; sort of integration effort, whether using ontologies, or a more </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; conventional data warehouse approach.&nbsp; I would suggest that at least the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; problem is more manageable than typical systems integration approaches </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; where n components require n^2 mappings.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>While I agree that mapping is an issue regardless of the integration paradigm/approach used (e.g., neutral model, data warehouse, database federations), I don't agree that the neutral model offers any advantages in terms of manageability.&nbsp; In fact, I think the problem is actually far more complex and less manageable than n^2 direct mappings.&nbsp; Sure, you reduce the number of mappings to 2 * n, but then you have to deal with:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp; - loss of semantic precision when &quot;generalizing&quot; local data into the neutral model, making extraction (interpretation) of meaning in the neutral model by other connected data source imprecise or wrong.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp; - Mapping &quot;data source A&quot; -&gt; &quot;neutral model NM&quot; and &quot;data source B&quot; -&gt; &quot;neutral model NM&quot; is not the same mapping &quot;data source A + B&quot; -&gt; &quot;neutral model NM&quot;.&nbsp; If there's an overlap of information in A and B, there's a kind of &quot;information multiplexing&quot; involved that makes correct mapping more difficult. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp; - Mapping between A and B is straight-forward because the &quot;system&quot; is essentially closed: you know what is in A and what is in B.&nbsp; Mapping A to a NM is less deterministic: you *think* you know what is in NM, but if others are free to map to it, their interpretation of what is in the NM will likely be very different from yours.&nbsp; In other words, the assumption that all mappers will interpret the NM in the same way while mapping is false. (Hell - the assumption that any two people will interpret *any* model the same way is probably false, too.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp; - When a new &quot;node&quot; is added to the community of integrated &quot;nodes&quot; mapped to a common NM, the mappings of all the nodes need to be reviewed to see if they still &quot;interpret&quot; the NM properly given the expansion of its semantic applicability with/for the new node.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Off the top of my head, these are just some of the problems with a neutral model integration approach.&nbsp; These problems can be overcome methodologically, of course, but the depth and dimensions of the problem are, I think, still poorly understood (if not mostly unrecognized).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;While I think you can sell the neutral ontology integration model as a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;problem solving approach, getting people to know about and use SUMO (or </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;any other &quot;upper&quot; ontology) as neutral ontology in their solution is a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;different kind of sales job altogether.&nbsp; And it is one that I don't think </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;will be very successful - any well-defined and well-bounded integration </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; &gt;effort will want to use their own.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; Can you discuss further why you feel they'd want to use their own?&nbsp; I've </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; found that unlike in the research world, people who want to accomplish a </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; practical commercial task are very happy to adopt someone else's models or </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt; software if it helps them get their job done.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>But in adopting someone else's models or software, how often do they use them exactly as is?&nbsp; I don't know how often I've heard &quot;My/our requirements are different&quot;.&nbsp; At the very best, they would use the models/software as a starting point for doing what they want to do.&nbsp; Adopting and adapting a neutral ontology model to the usage and needs of your local (integrated) community defeats the whole purpose of using it as a generalized integration model.&nbsp; People will interpret and use the model as they wish, and this can't be policed (and shouldn't because it is not wrong of them do this - it's natural.)&nbsp; The only way &quot;standardized&quot; interpretations will arise is by the conventions that arise and are reinforced in a language-use community, in which case it will pay for people to interpret the ontology the same way.&nbsp; (Remember: dictionaries don't specify the meaning of words; they document the conventional meanings of usages of a word.)</FONT></P>
