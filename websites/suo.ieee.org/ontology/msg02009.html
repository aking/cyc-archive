Phil,

First of all, I applaud the idea of an SUO dictionary, and I would like to
test it out.

That said, let me also remark that I am extremely hard-nosed about the
separation into the three levels (basic, structural and content), since this
provides an explicit boundary between metalevel and object level. As I
mentioned before, the basic level provides an interface between the KIF
language and ontological terminology, the structural level provides a
framework for the content level, and each domain of discourse at (and in)
the content level goes about its own business. So I would prefer that this
fundamental partition be obviously manifest in the SUO dictionary. This also
has bearing on the question of namespaces and namespace prefixes.

My view of the central purpose of a namespace mechanism is to disambiguate
the terminology by obviating term clashes. For example, (one can use any
separating notation, such as '.' or '$' or ':' or '::' etc.) the namespace
prefixes 'KIF', 'IFF', 'KR', 'EDU' could be used to distinguish the notion
of "class" mentioned on the list recently, with the prefixed term
'KIF$class' referring to the class notion in the Basic Ontology of Chris and
Pat (which I interpret to mean a general collection), the prefixed term
'IFF$Class' referring to the class notion in my IFF Foundation Ontology
(which refers the inclusive set-theoretic notion of class, inclusive in the
sense that sets are classes), the term 'KR$Class' in some object-level
ontology for knowledge representation (which may refer to the notion of
"natural kind"), and the term 'EDU$Class' in some object-level ontology for
education (which may refer to the notion of the class in which students
enroll).

Now, this idea of obviating term clashes using prefixes is the old notion of
disjoint union (note that I am not advocating a namespace hierarchy here,
which looks suspiciously like a file-system path notation -- I am advocating
a simple flat separating device). From the category-theory viewpoint,
disjoint unions are specific, concrete examples of the abstract notion of
coproducts (aka sums). The structural level uses coproducts as a structuring
mechanism for the content level. More specifically, coproducts are a special
case of colimits. And they are also the first step in a two-step process for
specifying colimits: 1st, specify a coproduct; 2nd, specify a quotient on
the coproduct (for example, this is the way to specify a pushout, a notion
mentioned elsewhere on this list). This means that there are terms in the
structural part that are used to specify coproducts, and these may be
concrete like a disjoint union or they may be more abstract.

One case where this comes up is in the specification of the "use" relation
between ontologies at the object (content) level. For example, suppose I am
axiomatizing an ontology describing how higher education can be represented
in knowledge representation. Here I may want to use both the Education
Ontology and the Knowledge Representation Ontology. Then I would normally
make the two assertions
    "*use* the Education Ontology with the 'EDU' namespace prefix"
    "*use* the Knowledge Representation Ontology with the 'KR' namespace
prefix"
but I could equivalently make the single assertion
    "*use* the *sum* ontology [Education Ontology with the 'EDU' tag,
Knowledge Representation Ontology with the 'KR' tag]"
where the tags are disjoint union tags (thus, indicating a specific,
concrete coproduct) and structural level terms *use* and *sum* are
high-lighted.

In addition, we may need namespaces and namespace prefixes within a single
object-level domain ontology. But, here I think a simple flat namespace may
still be appropriate.

Bottom line: the abstract notion of sum or coproduct is involved in
namespaces and namespace prefixing, in general, and ontology use
specification, in particular.

BTW, all terms in the structural level are strictly mathematical terms --
they have very precise definitions.

Robert,

After pondering your message, I propose to rename the web-enabled "SUO
Glossary" database as a "SUO Dictionary".

My hope and intent is that the SUO Dictionary can serve as a framework for
people working on ontological approaches within SUO to develop and post
definitions for terms used within their ontologies, as well as to define
terms that are more general. That is, the web-enabled dictionary could
provide a framework for collaboration to define terms being developed within
an "expert contribution" or a "working document", etc.

Thus, in working on a particular ontology, users may use the database as a
repository for defining terms used within an ontology, e.g. "continuant",
"occurrent", "class", "relation", "predicate", "physical", "abstract",
"entity", etc.

In addition, the database could be used to define words used more generally
in describing ontological approaches, such as "perdurantist", "endurantist",
etc.

Each entry in the dictionary may be specified as belonging to an "ontology
namespace". Users may create namespaces as they wish, and they can use "dot
notation" to indicate that a namespace occurs within a hierarchy of
namespaces, e.g. "FooOntology.Generic.Physics".

Robert, would the current structure of the SUO Dictionary at

<A  HREF="https://www.quickbase.com/db/6urbwpxk">https://www.quickbase.com/db/6urbwpxk</A>

support defining ontological terminology and namespaces according to the
approach you describe below? If not, are there ways it could be changed to
make it more suitable for your approach?

Please advise,

Phil Jackson
