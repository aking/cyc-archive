Doug,

Following is a note that I sent to another mailing list.  The book
by Sheriff is a good, short (100 page) introduction.

John Sowa
______________________________________________________________________

I (and Peirce) would certainly agree with Aldo de Moor:

&gt; From what I have gathered in the past few years, I know that
&gt; there is a lot of power and elegance in Peirce's ideas. These ideas should
&gt; be applied to real world projects, in order not only to have a deep soul,
&gt; but a healthy body as well.
&gt; 
&gt; However, we have a problem here.  For non-Peirceans, it is hard getting a
&gt; full grasp of the subtleties of his work. Much of the literature and
&gt; technical discussions posted on, for instance, this list is full of
&gt; jargon. This would be okay if it were only a forum for Peirce theorists.
&gt; However, our ultimate goal is to develop a concrete testbed project called
&gt; PORT. This means that the ideas need to be communicated not only to
&gt; non-Peirce scholars (hard), but also to potential sponsors (very hard).

Peirce couldn't even get those points across to his life-long
friend, William James.  Perhaps one approach would be to prepare
an annotated reading list of useful tutorials and surveys that
we could recommend to our students and colleagues.  It should
contain a short list of introductory works for people who have
little or no background in Peirce's ideas and a longer list of
Peirce's own writings and commentaries on them for people who have
some informtion about Peirce and his ideas, but need more detail.

As an example, I would suggest the following short (100 page) book
for people who would like a quick overview of Peirce's approach:

   John K. Sheriff, _Charles Peirce's Guess at the Riddle:
   Grounds for Human Significance_, Indiana University Press, 1994.
   100 pp.  $20.00 cloth; $9.95 paper.  (Amazon.com, by the way,
   offers the paperback version for $12.95.)

Following is the commentary by Nathan Houser that appears on the IUP
web site:

As Emerson describes it in his essay "Nature," the riddle that the
Sphinx puts to every great thinker concerns the relation between mind
and matter.  In this introduction to the thought of Charles S. Peirce,
John K. Sheriff presents a philosopher who speaks to this fundamental
question of the nature of human existence.  In clear and concise prose,
Sheriff describes Peirce's "theory of everything," a vision of cosmic
and human meaning that offers a positive alternative to popular
pessimistic and relativistic approaches to life and meaning.  Aimed
at nonspecialists, this book does not attempt to evaluate every
concept in Peirce's philosophy but instead shows how Peirce's
analyses of aesthetics, ethics, logic, and human consciousness rest
on the foundations of his grand theory of the cosmos, mind, and signs.
Sheriff convincingly demonstrates that Peirce's answer to the riddle
of the Sphinx has the potential to be a powerful, positive force in
contemporary culture.

For this summary and others about more specialized books on Peirce,
see <A  HREF="http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/web/news/books/notesx.htm">http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/web/news/books/notesx.htm</A>

For people who have some knowledge of logic, but no appreciation
for Peirce's work, I would recommend Peirce's MS 514 with my
commentary about it:

   <A  HREF="http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/web/news/books/notesx.htm">http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/web/news/books/notesx.htm</A>

This could be included with the introductory works, but with a
comment that it is intended for those who already have some
knowledge of symbolic logic.  Many of those people would not
be as impressed by Sheriff's book because it doesn't directly
address their interests (or what they think should be their
interests).

John Sowa
