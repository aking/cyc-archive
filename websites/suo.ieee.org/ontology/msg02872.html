Jon --

I am still trying to get a handle on what you are saying about what Peirce
was saying that you believe is so fundamental and compelling that we should
build our entire enterprise on concepts that you try to illustrate below.
I still have a problem with the various ways that you and the other
Peirceans talk about triadicity.  Just when I think I've got it, I see
evidence that I am incorrect in my understanding.  Apparently the language
and concepts that Peirce propounded evolved over time (76 definitions,
etc.), and seems to be a subject of controversy even among the most expert
scholars.

Here's what I think, picking up on your example below.  I'm going to
abandon your table format, because I don't think I can guarantee the
prettyprint features will accommodate what I want to say.  Were I to use
your table, it would look something like this:

¤~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
|Sign|Referent|Emitter|Recipient|Occasion|Medium|Purpose|Understanding|
¤~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
|    |        |       |         |        |      |       |             |
¤~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
|    |        |       |         |        |      |       |             |
¤~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
|    |        |       |         |        |      |       |             |
¤~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

*********** Begin sign instance ***********

Sign:
      "rose"

Referent:
      Imaginary color (expressed in the French language) of an imaginary
(plastic?) disc, imagined to be used as one of number of game pieces in an
imaginary game of Tower of Hanoi.

Sign emitter:
      Josiane Caron-Pargue

Purpose:
      Illustration of a technique for analyzing certain kinds of discourse
(??)

Occasion of emission:
      E-mail message on a discussion list of a working group of an
international standards body, distributed to the list on 18 May, 2001.

Medium:
      E-mail, including multiple servers, software protocols, screen
display, etc.

Understanding:
      The symbol "rose" standing metonymously for a pink imaginary disc in
an imaginary game.

Intended recipient(s) of sign:
      Participants in the e-mail list of a working group of an
international standards body.

*********** End sign instance ***********

Notice that this example is created from the point of view of the sign
emitter, rather than the sign recipient.  I am just now realizing that this
may be a major disconnect between what you are trying to do and what I hope
to accomplish through participation in SUO.  Your work seems to be centered
on inquiry, where my concern is communication.  For the kind of issues I am
trying to address e.g. commercial transactions among humans, using computer
and telecommunications networks) I think that it is much more possible to
address the problem from the point of view of what's going on with emitters
than recipients of signs.  We're much more likely to be able to identify
them, and to actually inquire into what is going on in their minds with
respect to purposes and understandings.

However, here's a mirror image of the same sign, from the point of view of
one recipient:

*********** Begin recipient viewpoint ***********

Sign:
      "rose"

Referent, or object referred to:
      Unknown (at the time).

Sign recipient:
      Doug McDavid

Purpose:
      Monitoring all communication on a discussion list of a working group
of an international standards body for general interest and possible future
useful applicability.

Occasion of receipt:
      Scanning e-mail messages on a discussion list of a working group of
an international standards body, on or about 18 May, 2001.

Medium:
      E-mail

Understanding:
      Nothing in particular. (When this thread started, I had no idea what
it was about).

Sign emitter:
      Josiane Caron-Pargue

*********** End recipient viewpoint ***********

Some observations about this example:

*  In a very real sense every sign is irreducible with respect to these
eight aspects (sign, referent, emitter, recipient, occasion, medium,
purpose understanding).

*  Some of the aspects may be unknown at various points in time, or
unknowable external to an individual sign emitter or recipient.

*  The medium tends to be common between emitter and recipient (sound
waves, magazine page, billboard, etc., with more variation possible in the
instance of computer networks).

*  There is complexity within each of these aspects, but most especially
with respect to purposes and understandings.

* Correspondence among understandings has a lot to do with correspondence
(or symmetry) among purposes.

*  The general purpose for efforts like SUO, in my opinion, has to do
specifically with helping to line up understandings between emitters and
recipients.  It is because of the ambiguity of signs based on implicit and
mismatched understandings that we want to devise schemes for making
dimensions of understanding explicit, so that signs will be interpreted
identically (or at least similarly) by multiple recipients, and in
correspondence with the purpose of the emitter.  For instance, the Tower of
Hanoi is not really a discussion of the spectral analysis of color, but
rather imaginary discs that are distinguished by color, such that the
dimensions of understanding will not line up properly without placing them
in the ontology of imagined molecular objects, rather than the ontology of
color terms.

Subject:  SUO: Re: Why Triadicity Matters To Interobjectivity




¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

If you will be gracious enough to float my promissory note on the
issue of definitions by relation-theoretic "universal properties",
then I think that I am finally ready to illustrate the two kinds
of transition from a 2-adic view to a fully 3-adic perspective
on sign relations.  Let us pick one of the 2-adic denotation
tables for color words and work on that, for instance, this:

¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| Object       | Sign         |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "rose"       |
| green        | "vert"       |
| yellow       | "jaune"      |
| black        | "noir"       |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

Let us suppose that Olivier, or someone else of the same name,
does not know any English yet, that Josiane is bilingual with
respect to English and French, and that Kim, with the help of
a French lexicon, is able to get by for easy words like these,
but that Godfrey knows only English.

Option (a) has us add a column for the interpretive agent.

¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| Object       | Sign         | Agent        |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "rose"       | Olivier      |
| green        | "vert"       | Olivier      |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | Olivier      |
| black        | "noir"       | Olivier      |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "rose"       | Josiane      |
| green        | "vert"       | Josiane      |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | Josiane      |
| black        | "noir"       | Josiane      |
|              |              |              |
| pink         | "pink"       | Josiane      |
| green        | "green"      | Josiane      |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | Josiane      |
| black        | "black"      | Josiane      |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "pink"       | Kim+Lex      |
| green        | "green"      | Kim+Lex      |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | Kim+Lex      |
| black        | "black"      | Kim+Lex      |
|              |              |              |
| pink         | "rose"       | Kim+Lex      |
| green        | "vert"       | Kim+Lex      |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | Kim+Lex      |
| black        | "noir"       | Kim+Lex      |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "pink"       | Godfrey      |
| green        | "green"      | Godfrey      |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | Godfrey      |
| black        | "black"      | Godfrey      |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

I think that it tends to become clear rather quickly,
after you spend a while looking at arrays like these,
that this is one of those ideas that may be nice in
principle, and in some ways it is really true that
all of this complexity is actually out there in
the semiotic conduct of sign-using agents, but
that we need another way to get a handle on
the complexities of this activity without
getting utterly overwhelmed by it.

On to plan b.

Option (b) has us add a column for the interpretant sign.
Initially, we assemble a separate sign relation for each
interpretive agent, for instance, creating the following:

 Sign Relation L(O) for Olivier
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| Object       | Sign         | Interpretant |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "rose"       | "rose"       |
| green        | "vert"       | "vert"       |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | "jaune"      |
| black        | "noir"       | "noir"       |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

 Sign Relation L(J) for Josiane
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| Object       | Sign         | Interpretant |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "rose"       | "rose"       |
| pink         | "rose"       | "pink"       |
| pink         | "pink"       | "rose"       |
| pink         | "pink"       | "pink"       |
|              |              |              |
| green        | "vert"       | "vert"       |
| green        | "vert"       | "green"      |
| green        | "green"      | "vert"       |
| green        | "green"      | "green"      |
|              |              |              |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | "jaune"      |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | "yellow"     |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | "jaune"      |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | "yellow"     |
|              |              |              |
| black        | "noir"       | "noir"       |
| black        | "noir"       | "black"      |
| black        | "black"      | "noir"       |
| black        | "black"      | "black"      |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

 Sign Relation L(K) for Kim+Lex
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| Object       | Sign         | Interpretant |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "pink"       | "pink"       |
| pink         | "pink"       | "rose"       |
| pink         | "rose"       | "pink"       |
| pink         | "rose"       | "rose"       |
|              |              |              |
| green        | "green"      | "green"      |
| green        | "green"      | "vert"       |
| green        | "vert"       | "green"      |
| green        | "vert"       | "vert"       |
|              |              |              |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | "yellow"     |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | "jaune"      |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | "yellow"     |
| yellow       | "jaune"      | "jaune"      |
|              |              |              |
| black        | "black"      | "black"      |
| black        | "black"      | "noir"       |
| black        | "noir"       | "black"      |
| black        | "noir"       | "noir"       |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

 Sign Relation L(G) for Godfrey
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| Object       | Sign         | Interpretant |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
| pink         | "pink"       | "pink"       |
| green        | "green"      | "green"      |
| yellow       | "yellow"     | "yellow"     |
| black        | "black"      | "black"      |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

Each of these sign relations has familiar type of structure.
The common object domain is O = {black, green, pink, yellow},
and "at" or "over" each object o in O one finds a "part" of
a "partition", that is to say, an equivalence class of an
equivalence relation on the correspoinding "syntax domain",
which is a convenient name for the set-theoretic union of
the sign domain S and the interpretant domain I, in these
cases having S = I.

For the monolingual interpreters Olivier and Godfrey,
each equivalence class of signs over each object is
in fact just a singletion set, containing the only
name that the agent knows for that object.

For the bilingual interpreters Josiane and Kim+Lex,
the sign relations are completely identical, since
the order of rows does not matter.  The partition
of signs that these two agents share, as a set of
sets, can be written as follows:

|    {{ "pink"   , "rose"  },
|     { "green"  , "vert"  },
|     { "yellow" , "jaune" },
|     { "black"  , "noir"  }}

That should be enough for today.
