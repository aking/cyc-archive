All,
        Allow me to reply to a few more of Bob's points. 
 
&gt;  In private communications to me, Jim has asserted that he has broad power
to do what he thinks best,   
 
I have been advised by representatives of our next higher body that a WG
Chair has broad power to do what he or she thinks is best, plus I was
advised to wield this power to keep order and help with progress.  I am
taking this advice. 
 
MW: Usually the best use of power is to prevent its abuse by others, rather
than to wield it. 
 
&gt; [He] does not recognize my objection to this action and is not bound by
Robert's Rules.  
 
In declaring the selection of Ian Niles as Technical Editor, I did recognize
your objection, but concluded it was not enough to prevent this action.  I
originally didn't recognize it because I interpreted that you were objection
to a prior decision, but you cleared this up and I later did recognize it.
 
[He] is not bound by Robert's Rules.  
This is admittedly a void.  Common practice in IEEE is that Robert's Rules
do not apply to email discussions, since they could easily be abused to
stall progress. In a meeting, quick votes as possible by voice or show of
hand.  Via email, each vote can take 1-2 weeks and are burdensome.  The IEEE
CS SAB (our next higher body) is working on rules for email groups.  I'll
post them when available, but for now, I will attempt to keep things as fair
as possible.  
 
MW: I think the problem here is that at one point you said that we would
conduct ourselves by Robert's Rules, and I do not recall hearing anything to
the contrary since, until now (which looks motivated by the decision you
want to make). Personally, I think that until we have something simpler,
then it would be best to stick to Robert's Rules. At least we know what the
rules are then, and they don't keep changing. I would see them being
burdensome as being an advantage. I.e. a discouragement to anyone making
formal proposals. 
 
&gt;  In another circumstance Jim has asserted that since there were only two
objections, those were not enough.  He seems to think that he has the right
to determine if objections meet his own (unstated) test of reasonableness
and how many objections are enough.  
 
&gt; I do think we should specify the number of objections that can force a
vote, but for now, I (as Chair) made that determination and stand by it.
You are free to appeal this.
 
M W: Well I guess most of us thought that since we were acting under
Robert's Rules, one objection was enough. Now you want to interpret this
silence as consent, rather than call a vote. I think we would not be
unreasonable in feeling mislead.  

If the chair does not act to resolve this issue,  I will make a formal
motion that incorporates the process outlined above.  This will require a
vote.  


In a physical meeting (which we are not), working under Robert's Rules
(which we are not), a motion with a second gets voted on.    In our current
situation, I would say that any relevant motion that has enough support to
show any conceivable chance of passage, I will gladly put to a vote.   

MW: Again, I think it is safer to do this by Robert's Rules. I will happily
live with the overhead. It can't be worse than the current mayhem. 

Bob

All, 

        As Ian Niles is the only volunteer for the position of Technical 
Editor for the Merged Ontology document, and as there is only one objection 
to his selection (from Bob Spillers), Ian Niles is hereby selected for this 
position.

SUO, 


        Ian Niles is the only person to volunteer to serve as Technical 
Editor for the Merged Ontology. (Anyone surprised?)   Are there any 
objections to him serving in this position?
