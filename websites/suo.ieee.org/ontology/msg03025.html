&gt; HP: Incidentally, this universal use of &quot;sign&quot; by Peirce is one of the causes he is
&gt;     often misunderstood by scientists and mathematicians (as well as normal people)
&gt;     who are accustomed to normal usage that implies a non-arbitrary, causal or
&gt;     active (verbal, non-displaceable, spatially and temporally) relation to its
&gt;     referent (e.g., fever is a sign or signature or signifier of disease).
&gt; 
&gt; HP: A symbol usually implies an arbitrary passive (nominal, displaceable) relation
&gt;     to its referent.  This is consistent with etymology as well as common usage.
&gt;     (I think C.W. Morris develops this view.)


I only quite recently realized why Peirce decided to use the word &quot;sign&quot; as
the generic term, whereas in his earliest published work he used &quot;sign&quot;
rather as the name for what he later called &quot;index&quot;.  Why the change from
the earlier usage when the earlier one seems to be the usage more consistent
with common sense usage?  I believe the reason is this.  

For one thing, Peirce's original motive for developing the theory of signs
was in the interest of establishing logic as a science, which requires that
its subject-matter by publicly observable.  Thus although his dictum that
&quot;all thought is in signs&quot; comes to have a number of different meanings, the
original sense of it was that we are to regard thought as present in
publicly available inscriptions and sounds, like marks on a blackboard or a
sheet or paper or in aural media, and thought as something hidden because
private is to be regarded as the special case, of no special interest to the
logician, anyway, until it gets publicly expressed.  (This is not to be
confused with a behaviorist conception of thought: that wasn't what he had
in mind.  What he had in mind was that thoughts are in the signs you see in
front of you as relational properties thereof, grounded in one way or
another in properties of the publicly available inscriptions: intrinsic
(i.e. monadic, qualitative), dyadic, or triadic properties, grounding,
respectively, what he later called iconic, indexical, and symbolic signs
respectively.

Still, this doesn't fully account for it since he could have used some other
term for any sort of meaningful or significant entity and reserved the word
&quot;sign&quot; for indices only, which are signs of the type grounded in dyadic or
existential relationships, which is what you have in mind in your message, I
take it.  Now, we actually do find it fairly natural to refer to actual
inscriptions of symbols on a page or a blackboard as being signs, and Peirce
is certainly not the only theorist to refer to actually occurring symbols
and icons as being &quot;signs&quot;, but, nevertheless, there is apparently some
infelicity in his decision to use &quot;sign&quot; as the generic term, even given all
that I have said thus far, and it has always made me uneasy, too, even
though I could never come up with an alternative terminology set that
seemed, on balance, to be nearly as good.  

But then I noticed something the other day that had completely escaped my
attention all along that does seem to me to fully justify it, given ordinary
usage, namely, the fact that in treating meaningful entities as public in
the way indicated above, he was regarding thinking as a dialogical process,
too, and his decision to use the word &quot;sign&quot; as the generic term must have
been due to his realization that the development of logic as a theory of a
dialogical process -- which is what distinguishes his view from the usual
way of thinking of logic -- requires regarding the publicly available sound
or inscription as an actually occurring entity the significance of which is
to be responded to (i.e. interpreted).  That is, by using the word &quot;sign&quot; as
his technical term of art for the entity to be interpreted, he was, in
effect, requiring of the logician that the logican recognize that the
meaningful entity must first of all be understood by the interpreter in its
actual occurring or existential character, regardless of whether or not it
is its iconic or indexical or symbolic value that one is especially
interested in.  

Even if, say, one is interested in it primarily as a symbol, there is no
access to it as a symbol without prior understanding of its evidential value
as something actually occurring hic et nunc, i.e. at this time and this
place, i.e. its value as an index.  Peirce warns us of this in his
insistence that the replica of the symbol, the actually inscribed symbol, is
not itself the symbol proper, which is general whereas the replica is
singular.  My guess is that he just took it for granted that anybody
interested in the matter would understand that he was quite intentionally
drawing upon our ordinary understanding of &quot;sign&quot; as a resource, forcing us
in that way to regard thought as dialogical.  As usual, he over-rated his
readers.    

Thus it is symptomatic of our failure to understand what his most basic
logical move is, namely, to regard thought as essentially of the nature of a
dialogical process, that we do find it odd that he would use the word as he
does!  We say &quot;Oh, great idea that thought is dialogical! Peirce has such
good ideas!&quot; and then go right ahead and regard logic from the point of view
of monologue instead, and wonder idly, now and again, why we cannot seem to
get any mileage out of the idea of thought as dialogical after all!

Our hang-up here is that we cannot get out of the box built by the
architects of the so-called &quot;linguistic revolution&quot;, who have dominated 20th
Century thought in nearly every field concerned with meaning, who thought
you can say what words mean apart from any actual context of usage, and
regarded logic as the construction of an ideal system of some sort instead
of as a theory of the functional aspects of a process.
