Pat,

I more or less agree with your comments on this topic, but
there is one point I would like to emphasize more strongly:

JS&gt;This is another common use.  But in the programming language
&gt;&gt;community (which now includes almost every computer science
&gt;&gt;major and almost everybody who has ever used or heard about
&gt;&gt;object-oriented programming languages) a class has a very
&gt;&gt;specific meaning:  it is a kind of data type that has
&gt;&gt;associated methods.

PH&gt;That isn't incompatible with the CLASSIC/LOOM usage, however.

JS&gt;Essentially all AI languages, from LISP and Prolog to LOOM,
&gt;&gt;Classic, CLIPS, etc., are almost unknown among the overwhelming
&gt;&gt;majority of programmers in the world.  For computer science
&gt;&gt;majors and working programmers today, a class is a data type
&gt;&gt;with methods.
&gt;
&gt;True, but programmers are not our only (or even intended primary) 
&gt;audience here, I would judge.

I just returned from an important audience, namely ISO SC 32
Working Group 2, where we have been proposing the KIF and CG
standards as New Work Items for ISO standards.

Of the people in that group (which is quite representative of
the larger community of "IT professionals"), Michael Gruninger,
Nancy Lawler, and I were the only three who had ever heard of
LOOM or Classic.

I would say that the audience for ontology is extremely large,
and of that group the IT professionals (including programmers)
are one very large subgroup.  Another very large subgroup
(and possibly an even much larger group if people like us
were able to provide suitable tools for them to work with)
includes nonprogrammers who are today doing one kind of job
or another than involves "taxonomy", "classification",
"lexicography", "terminology", and many related disciplines.

Of those two groups, the people in the world who have ever
heard of LOOM, CLASSIC, much less DAML, OIL, etc., are an
invisible minority.  The people who have heard of Java, C++,
and other such O-O languages are overwhelmingly more numerous.
And the people who don't know anything about any of those
topics are the ones who will have a potentially decisive
influence on how and whether anything we do about ontology
will ever be accepted, developed, and used.

In any case, there were some interesteing developments today
at ISO SC32 WG2, which I will report on later.  (I plan to
attend Friday morning's meeting at which the outcomes of
today's discussions will be much clearer.)

John Sowa
