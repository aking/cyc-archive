&gt; &gt; &gt;Pat,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;	Thanks for your criticisms of the merged ontology.
&gt; &gt; Please see my
&gt; &gt; &gt;responses below.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;-Ian
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS. I have been browsing the merged ontology and so far
&gt; &gt; *every single
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing* I have seen in it is wrong. In particular (in no particular
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; order):
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. the axiom for piece-of is obviously wrong, since it
&gt; &gt; entails that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every piece has all the properties of the whole:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (=&gt; (piece-of ?X ?Y) (forall (?Z) (=&gt; (instance-of ?Y ?Z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (instance-of ?X ?Z))))
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't see why this strikes you as obviously wrong.  I
&gt; &gt; defined 'piece-of'
&gt; &gt; &gt;to be a specialization of 'part-of', where both of the arguments are
&gt; &gt; &gt;stuff-like entities.  You may believe that such a
&gt; &gt; specialization is not
&gt; &gt; &gt;useful or you may be violating your own dictum that the
&gt; &gt; meaning of a term in
&gt; &gt; &gt;a formal language is determined solely by the axioms that
&gt; &gt; contain it.  It's
&gt; &gt; &gt;hard to see what you're up to here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No, my point is that this axiom says that every property (forall
&gt; &gt; (?Z)...) of a piece of stuff is inherited by all its pieces. That is
&gt; &gt; obviously false. (For example, the pieces typically weigh less than
&gt; &gt; the whole; obvious things like that.) If you mean this to apply only
&gt; &gt; to certain 'relevant' properties, then you need to restrict that
&gt; &gt; quantifier to include a condition like (relevant ?Z), and then give
&gt; &gt; us some axioms for relevant.
&gt;
&gt;No, actually what you say is false.  According to the merged ontology, the
&gt;second argument of 'instance-of' is required to be a class, i.e. a natural
&gt;kind, and the examples of "irrelevant" properties that you cite simply don't
&gt;and wouldn't show up as classes in the ontology.

Then (1) you need to reconcile this usage with Chris Menzel's 
structural ontology, where 'class' is synonymous with 'property' and 
(instance ?y ?z) is equivalent to (?z ?y);
(2) you need to axiomatize 'natural kind' (and good luck, since one 
definition of 'natural kind' is that it refers to any concept that 
cannot be fully axiomatised); and
(3) my point still applies in any case, since it is just as true of 
natural kinds that they are not all inherited under parthood.

Look, I know what your axiom is trying to say. What you want to say 
is that every part is similar to every other part in *certain ways* , 
where 'certain ways' refers to a certain category of properties that 
are the same of all parts of a 'uniform' thing. Properties such as 
being made of a certain stuff, being at a certain temperature, and so 
on. The trouble is that there are plenty of other properties that do 
not characterise these 'certain ways', and do not satisfy this axiom. 
Until you nail down the properties you want to talk about, this axiom 
is either false (as it stands) or useless (if restricted to 
'relevant', since that can only be defined so as to make the axiom 
circular. on the face of it.) Your notion of relevance is trying to 
prop itself up, but it can't stand on its own.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. piece-of only applies to ContinuousObjects, which is wrong.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;See my comment above.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, but then you should document somewhere that piece-of doesnt mean
&gt; &gt; "piece of". My automobile isn't a ContinuousObject, but it has pieces.
&gt;
&gt;Really?  Nothing hinges on this, but your way of putting it sounds
&gt;infelicitous to my ear.  A pane of glass can be broken into pieces, but my
&gt;eyes would scan twice if I came across the phrase "automobile pieces" in,
&gt;e.g., newspaper text.

You can find "automobile parts" in the yellow pages, however.

(I can't help noting that if you are using 'infelicitous to the ear' 
as a guide to ontological classification, no wonder the m.o. is in 
the state it is in. What on earth has that got to do with ontology?)

.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The explanation for continuousObject does not make sense. It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starts "A ContinuousObject is an object in which every part is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; similar to every other in every relevant respect." which is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contradiction in itself, since some parts presumably contain other
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parts as parts.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This would be a contradiction only if one assumed that the
&gt; &gt; relevant respects
&gt; &gt; &gt;apply to all of the parts of the original parts, and I am
&gt; &gt; not making this
&gt; &gt; &gt;assumption.  Generally speaking, when one distinguishes
&gt; &gt; stuffs from objects,
&gt; &gt; &gt;one claims that the stuffs are stuff-like only at or above a
&gt; &gt; certain level
&gt; &gt; &gt;of granularity, and, hence, parts of things at this level of
&gt; &gt; granularity
&gt; &gt; &gt;will not be stuff-like.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But that is not what the text I cited says. It says "..in which EVERY
&gt; &gt; part is similar...".  My point wasnt about the granularity issue, but
&gt; &gt; about the fact that a part is not similar to the whole of which it is
&gt; &gt; a part in every respect.
&gt;
&gt;I just don't follow you.

Apparently not.
.....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Can something be a selfConnectedObject and also a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ContinuousObject? If so, what is a superficial-part-of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ContinuousObject, and if a superficial-part-of is also a
&gt; &gt; part, is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; similar in every relevant respect to a non-superficial
&gt; &gt; part? If not,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; why is the object Continuous; if so, what makes the part
&gt; &gt; superificial?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Yes, the merged ontology allows that a ContinuousObject can also be a
&gt; &gt; &gt;SelfConnectedObject.  A superficial part of a
&gt; &gt; ContinuousObject would be a
&gt; &gt; &gt;part of the ContinuousObject at the surface which has the precise
&gt; &gt; &gt;granularity for the stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You are relying on this notion of granularity to do a lot of your
&gt; &gt; work here. I would urge caution, since you will have a very hard time
&gt; &gt; cashing out this intellectual loan.
&gt;
&gt;True, I am relying heavily on the notion of granularity and I would have a
&gt;difficult time fully axiomatizing this notion, I'm sure.  However, I don't
&gt;see that we're required to axiomatize this notion.  Of course, it would be
&gt;nice if we could specify this notion with necessary and sufficient
&gt;conditions,

I said nothing about necessary and sufficient conditions. (You might 
read my old papers on naive physics to see my opinions on the 
irrelevance of giving such definitions.) But it is irresponsible to 
say that you are not going to give *any* account of a concept which 
is notoriously problematic and which you also propose to give a 
central role in an ontology. Reasoners are going to have to be able 
to draw *some* conclusions.

&gt;but there are doubtless going to be some primitive concepts in
&gt;the ontology, and granularity looks to me to be a good candidate for this
&gt;category.

All concepts are primitive. We still need axioms about them.

&gt;......
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;A superficial part could be similar in every
&gt; &gt; &gt;relevant respect to a non-superficial part, because I think
&gt; &gt; we're all agreed
&gt; &gt; &gt;that relevant respects do not encompass locative properties.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We are? I was going to ask you what 'relevant respect' meant, in
&gt; &gt; fact, and how you were going to axiomatize it. Maybe you could expand
&gt; &gt; on this point a little.
&gt;
&gt;My response is just what I said above.  Since 'instance-of' requires a class
&gt;as its second argument, we don't have to worry about the sort of silly
&gt;properties that seem to concern you.

Maybe you should read up on "class". A class is simply a property. 
Classes have no magical properties of 'naturalness' and are not 
guaranteed to not be 'silly', unless you somehow provide axioms to 
rule out the silliness. (For example, would having a certain mass be 
a silly property?)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, part
&gt; &gt; &gt;of what makes a part superficial is that it is located at
&gt; &gt; the surface of the
&gt; &gt; &gt;object.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That doesnt quite make sense, since a part is 3-d and a surface is
&gt; &gt; 2-d. What you might mean (?) is that the part is in contact with the
&gt; &gt; surface, or that part of its surface is part of the surface of the
&gt; &gt; whole thing of which it is a part, ie it shares some of the whole
&gt; &gt; thing's surface. But even that will not do, presumably, since that
&gt; &gt; would also apply to the whole object. I really don't see any way to
&gt; &gt; characterize 'superfical part' in terms of location alone.
&gt;
&gt;I agree.  I think I spoke too loosely.  Casati and Varzi, from whose book
&gt;the notion is taken, characterize a "superficial part" as a part which does
&gt;not have an "interior part".

OK. I see how they are doing it. You might want to check carefully 
however on whether 'superficial part' means something like a surface 
or something like a skin, because the things you say about it 
elsewhere will be different in the two cases.
.....

&gt;......
&gt;OK, how about we replace the term "HumanCausedProcess" with
&gt;"IntentionallyCausedProcess" and revise the corresponding axiom accordingly.
&gt;How does that sound?

Much better, thanks.

Pat
