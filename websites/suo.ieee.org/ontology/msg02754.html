Dear Colleagues,

Introduction

You will be aware that Jim has been asking several of us if we
will propose specific pieces of work to be a focus of activity
for the SUO group, and I am one of the people he has approached.

The idea is that we might adopt a number of work items which
members of the SUO may choose to contribute to. This implies
formally accepting them as work items within the SUO work group.

Since we don't have much practise of doing things formally here
I am going to start by proposing the process I think we should
adopt. It is a straight copy of what we do in ISO TC184/SC4, and
is probably based on Roberts' Rules.

Below is a resolution that is what you are formally asked to 
vote on. Before it is an introduction that provides background
material to the resolution. The introduction does not form part
of the resolution. To proceed the resolution requires a second.
If/when a second is found, then the resolution is open for 
discussion. Comments may be made about the appropriateness of
the resolution and changes may be suggested. The proposer has 
the absolute right to accept or reject any proposed changes
(it is their resolution). If there have been no negative
comments, then the chair may seek to pass the resolution by
acclamation (silence is consent). Otherwise you move to a vote.
A simple majority of those voting for over those voting against
(abstentions don't count) is sufficient to pass the resolution.

Since we are an e-mail community the principle issue is timing.
Especially since members may not be "present" at all times.

I suggest that a minimum of 1 week is allowed for discussion,
after which the proposer may call for a vote at any time at 
their discretion. I suggest that 1 week is allowed for votes
to be made by voting members, and that non-votes (silence) is
taken as abstention. Votes may either be to the chair or the
list as individuals prefer.

I know some people here are suspicious of any degree of 
formality in what we do, so I think it is worth noting that 
a resolution represents the position of the group as a whole. 
The group has no power over its members and no decision of the 
group can require any action of any individual. Resolutions
usually offer approval, or encouragement for certain actions
that are proposed, approval of deliverables for certain 
purposes, or agreeing to follow certain procedures in how
we conduct our business. (If what I have done here goes
beyond elucidating what Roberts' Rules says anyway, then
the subject of this note could well be the basis of a 
resolution in this last category.)

Regards  
      Matthew
