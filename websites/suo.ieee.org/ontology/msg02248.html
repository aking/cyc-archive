Jon,

I agree with the sentiment:

JA&gt;I think it is practically essential that the SUO embody
&gt;a "soundly understood ontology" of mathematical objects,
&gt;in particular, relations and tuples, especially since
&gt;these sorts of objects, notions, constructs, concepts,
&gt;or whatever you wish to call them, are the very sorts
&gt;of things that are typically used to build models of
&gt;other sorts of stuff in the world.

Yes, as a basis for the SUO, we have already made a decision to adopt
predicate calculus, as mapped into notations such as KIF, CGs, SQL,
OIL, DAML, RDF, UML, etc., etc., etc.  Arguing about that point is
futile, since the computers of the world are geared up to process
relations, tuples, graphs, and related data structures.  There are
many suggestions for going to other kinds of things, such as neural
networks, virtual reality, and quantum computing, but they will not
replace the tuples for a long time.

The big issue for the SUO is how to map the world in all its glory,
pomp, circumstance, and messy details into tuples.

JA&gt;But before the SUO comes to embody such an understanding,
&gt;it will be needful for those who construct or design it
&gt;to arrive at such an understanding themselves, and our
&gt;current discussions around the topics of relations and
&gt;tuples do not, from my perspective, appear to reflect
&gt;any such understanding yet.

I agree that there are many issues on which we have not yet
reached closure.  In particular, I agree with you about the need
for triadic representations.  However, I have stopped pushing
that idea on SUO list because enough bits have been spilled on
this topic already.

My current strategy is to stop wasting time arguing about the
abstractions.  Instead, I am working on answering another challenge:
how do those triads support actual language and reasoning about
representation, causality, purpose, beliefs, desires, intentions,
agents, social interactions, etc.?  There is a lot of very hard work
to do in writing definitions that represent the hundreds of thousands
of word senses in English and other languages.  It would be useful
to show how the theory could represent just a few word senses --
ideally more than one, but even one would be better than none.

JA&gt;Thus, I would like to dedicate this thread, not in the sense
&gt;of "in memoriam", I hope, but in the sense of concerted work,
&gt;to the task of coming to a "solidly underfoot organization"
&gt;of these concepts.

Good luck.  But it is important to emphasize the pragmatic results:
how can the abstract theory lead to better ways of representing,
talking about, and reasoning about the problems that the SUO people
are trying to solve?

The best collaboration has to work both ways:  the people with the
problems have to explain what they need to represent, and the people
with the theories have to show, in detail, how their theories can help
to solve the problems.  And a lot of iterative work with I/O in both
directions will be necessary.

John Sowa

PS:  By the way, thank you for writing in boring, but readable English.
