Dear Ian,

I said below:

&gt; MW: I have a high level model for a 4D viewpoint, a subset of 
&gt; which might be a suitable start point for this. The main 
&gt; issue is that it is in EXPRESS (ISO10303-11) an 
&gt; entity-relationship language, and not KIF, so it would need 
&gt; translation. Further, it is mostly structural at present with 
&gt; relatively few axioms.

Of course I translated part of an earlier version of this into KIF in the
autumn in a paper entitled "Standard Upper Ontology: A Documentation Trial".
I just checked and was disappointed to find this hasn't made the SUO Web
site, but if you do not have it I can forward you a copy. Adam gutted the
document for the KIF content at some point and sent it to the SUO list.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; Dear Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your responses below. Despite voting "no" I do 
&gt; appreciate the work you have done. I'm not usre what else you 
&gt; could have done at this stage. I mostly think the question of 
&gt; accepting the document as a Base Document was somewhat premature.
&gt; 
&gt; See comments below.

&gt; &gt; &gt; WG
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear James,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As one of the more active participants, I think I should vote 
&gt; &gt; &gt; publicly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I vote NO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do think it is suitable as a working paper.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I also feel I should give some reasons.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The overall reason is that I would not use it as a start 
&gt; &gt; &gt; point for anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I am currently doing or about to do. I have only had 
&gt; &gt; &gt; time to give a
&gt; &gt; &gt; brief review of the combined document, however, the following 
&gt; &gt; &gt; major sticking
&gt; &gt; &gt; points exist for me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. n-th Domain is still in there, though I'm pleased to 
&gt; see that its
&gt; &gt; &gt; siblings seem to have been dropped. N-th domain is equivalent 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to writing a
&gt; &gt; &gt; different language with KIF and then using that whilst 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pretending it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; still KIF. Further it is unnecessary, the equivalent 
&gt; &gt; &gt; statements can be made
&gt; &gt; &gt; in perfectly ordinary KIF.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, 'nth-domain' is really just syntactic sugar.  All 
&gt; &gt; formulas involving
&gt; &gt; this predicate can be recast, using the template provided in 
&gt; &gt; the "Structural
&gt; &gt; Ontology" section of the merged ontology document, into 
&gt; &gt; uncontroversially
&gt; &gt; first order language.  I don't see that this is a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Quite, so why not do it?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The ontology has a 3D rather than 4D foundation. I can't 
&gt; &gt; &gt; imagine going
&gt; &gt; &gt; back from 4D to 3D, except to analyse and retrieve useful ideas.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Even if the merged ontology does indeed have a "3D" foundation, this
&gt; &gt; foundation could, it seems to me, be embedded within a "4D" 
&gt; &gt; framework.  If
&gt; &gt; you disagree, could you indicate why you think this is impossible?
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You will have seen that Pat has raised some doubts about 
&gt; the possibility of doing this. The problem arises if 3D and 
&gt; 4D viewpoints are extended subsets of each other. I am more 
&gt; hopeful, in moving from a 3D world to 4D I have not noticed 
&gt; anything I have lost, only things gained, so I am prepared to 
&gt; bet that a 3D viewpoint can be mapped onto a 4D viewpoint. 
&gt; What I am prepared to bet is some effort to try to make the 
&gt; mapping - I believe in experiment as much as analysis for 
&gt; making progress.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This could get quite messy. For instance, what I pick up 
&gt; from Pat is that a 4D object may not be a member of a 3D 
&gt; class, but from a 4D object and its classes, we may be able 
&gt; to infer a 3D object and its classes/properties etc, and 
&gt; vice-versa (within the limits of what can be represented in 
&gt; 3D and/or 4D).
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I have a high level model for a 4D viewpoint, a subset of 
&gt; which might be a suitable start point for this. The main 
&gt; issue is that it is in EXPRESS (ISO10303-11) an 
&gt; entity-relationship language, and not KIF, so it would need 
&gt; translation. Further, it is mostly structural at present with 
&gt; relatively few axioms.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The foundation is John Sowa's lattice of classes, and 
&gt; &gt; whilst I will
&gt; &gt; &gt; defend another mans right to use whatever classes he chooses, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and am happy
&gt; &gt; &gt; to find these classes interesting, for me they do not 
&gt; provide a firm
&gt; &gt; &gt; foundation. The primary reason for this is their basis in Pierce's
&gt; &gt; &gt; Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness, concepts which in trying 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to grasp them,
&gt; &gt; &gt; remind me more of jelly than something I would care to build 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on - each time
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have thought I had them nailed down, they moved on me.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree that Pierce's tripartite distinction is a stumbling 
&gt; &gt; block for its
&gt; &gt; broad acceptance in an engineering context (whatever 
&gt; &gt; philosophical merits it
&gt; &gt; may have).  It is for precisely this reason that I removed 
&gt; &gt; the associated
&gt; &gt; notions (e.g. 'Mediating' versus 'Relative', 'Prehension', 
&gt; &gt; etc.) in the
&gt; &gt; latest version of the merged ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: But then you are left with a bunch of classes without a 
&gt; foundation at all. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: With something I don't understand, I try to get down into 
&gt; subtypes and instances. So from a 4D perspective if we can 
&gt; get down to things that are relatively concrete, these could 
&gt; be mapped to a 4D model, you could then see the superclasses 
&gt; as defined by their subclasses and example members, and thus 
&gt; get a better grip on Firstness, secondness, and thirdness.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Be careful though, what you are then talking about is 
&gt; really multiple ontologies, and how they relate to each 
&gt; other. This would enable people to use the ontology most 
&gt; relevant to their needs, but express the same thing in 
&gt; another ontology, when that was more appropriate. I think 
&gt; these are important things to (try) to do, but I wouldn't 
&gt; want to suggest it was easy.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The axioms on entity and class require that all classes 
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a subtype of
&gt; &gt; &gt; entity. This means that no class can have classes as members. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is very
&gt; &gt; &gt; restrictive.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree that this is a problem, and it is one that Pay Hayes 
&gt; &gt; noted as well.
&gt; &gt; I suggest that we proceed by asking John Sowa to present his 
&gt; &gt; view on why the
&gt; &gt; axioms should be retained.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Did I miss something? I didn't see John propose this. If 
&gt; retained, this would be more restrictive than entity 
&gt; relationship modelling, and it was the restrictions there 
&gt; that lead me to look at logic based approaches in the first place.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. I could create a similar list of questions and concerns as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pat has done
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the details of the ontology. I do not have the time this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; would take at
&gt; &gt; &gt; present - I can't decide whether that is fortunate or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunate, and for
&gt; &gt; &gt; whom.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not necessarily an exhaustive list, but for me it is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; sufficient. 
&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SUO Participants,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Attached is the latest version of Ian Niles'  Merged 
&gt; &gt; Ontology.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. This message is a call for a vote as to whether this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; document should be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approved as a 'Base Document' for IEEE P1600.1 Standard 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Upper Ontology
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Working Group.  Within IEEE, there is no official 
&gt; &gt; &gt; definition of a Base
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Document; however, the definitions below from the IEEE 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Learning Technology
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Standards Committee (our original sponsor) are as good as any.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consensus we have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to decide if we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are going to go down this path or not.  Multiple base 
&gt; &gt; documents are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible, so anyone else is free to submit one.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; improvements to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; document, unless they are major enough for you to vote 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; against focusing work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on this document.  However, such general improvement comments 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are welcome
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be resolved (but not until after completion of this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Base Document
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vote). 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Since we are still in the process of establishing official 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; voting rights,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw 
&gt; &gt; &gt; poll, such that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consensus is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (once voting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rights are established).  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), 
&gt; &gt; NO (comments
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Please send your votes directly to me (to reduce list 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; traffic), though
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you may send them to the entire list if you desire.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. Please vote by Jan 29, 2001. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9. Please send in any questions or comments.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IEEE LTSC Nomenclature of Documents 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working paper: Does not automatically get agenda time. Not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; related to standards words (e.g., liaison reports, the agenda 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself). A
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working paper is any document with a document number or 
&gt; a document
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduced at a meeting (assuming the WG accepts it as a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working paper).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Working papers don't automatically receive agenda time. The 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WG Chair may
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; choose to give higher agenda priority to discussion on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working papers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; received two weeks prior to the meeting. (Members may object 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on papers with less than two weeks notice, but the objection 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is based on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to digest the document, not to obstruct the process; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the objection
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may prevent the paper from get agenda time, but not 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily prevent the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion -- be considerate both ways, the chair will rule.) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base document: Starting point for standards words (it's clear 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the document
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *can* be transformed into standards words). Has no official 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight (not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard). Might not be in standards wording. Might not be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; complete with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respect to the scope and/or final standard. Might be 
&gt; multiple base
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; documents. Automatically allocated agenda time since this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the main
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; product of the WG. Most base documents represent substantial 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work created
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; outside the committee and introduced into the WG. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working draft: The base documents (assuming more than one) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are combined over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time. The combination document now becomes a working draft. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; draft is refined and polished. The working draft is adapted 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the style
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guides. Working drafts may be available to the public. 
&gt; &gt; Automatically
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; allocated agenda time (the rest below all have agenda time). 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base document vs. working draft: There may be multiple base 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; documents that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become the starting points for a standard. There is only one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working draft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a standard (but many revisions, each with its own 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; document number). A
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base document identifies the origin of the work for 
&gt; &gt; several reasons:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; technical, rationale, intellectual property, acknowledgement. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; committee draft: The working draft is now in the style of a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; document substatially represents the intended final standard. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Changes may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; made. There may be several committee drafts. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working draft vs. committee draft: Each revision of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; working draft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represents a batch of edits that the WG accepts. Typically, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is a new
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working draft each meeting while the document is being 
&gt; &gt; &gt; developed, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working drafts may be less frequent. Committee drafts are 
&gt; &gt; important
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; milestones because they represent to the public "this is what 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the final
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard will look like". Working drafts may be available or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public. Committe drafts are public. Working drafts may be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to solicit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public comments. Committee drafts are always used to 
&gt; &gt; solicit public
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comments. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; draft standard: The document is *complete*. There may be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minor editoral
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changes, but no substantive changes are intended. Draft 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standards may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referred to (i.e., incorporated by reference) in *other* 
&gt; &gt; standards. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approved standard: The document is now an official standard. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Summary: Committee members submit working papers. Working 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; papers may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; related to committee work, technical contributions, and 
&gt; &gt; so on. Base
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; documents are working papers approved as a "base document". 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One or more base
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; documents may be part of a standard. When base documents are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; revised they
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become a new working paper but with the automatic agenda 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; item. At some point
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the working papers and/or base documents are combined to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become a working
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; draft. Later on, additional working papers and additional 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; base documents may
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be added to the working draft. Working drafts may be made 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; available for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; public comment. Committee drafts represent the full 
&gt; &gt; intention of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard. Committee drafts are available for public comment 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and are likely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be balloted (comments from voting and non-voting 
&gt; &gt; &gt; members). A draft
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard represents the completed standard in every way 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (wording, style,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layout, etc.) except that it is not official. An approved 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; draft standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; becomes a official standard after a succesful ballot and a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process review.
