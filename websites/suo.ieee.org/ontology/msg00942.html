Hi Pat,

You are right about the theses - I was not trying to provide an exhaustive
list, just clarify which were being used in the discussion. But you are
right to point out the possibility space. I share with you (and others) a
liking for the 4-D (Perdurantist) view - at least for the tasks I am
interested in. However, I think it is always useful to look at other
solutions and the route they take.

The possibility space seem to be:

1. Every occurrent has a continuant of which it is the life.
2. Every continuant has an occurrent which is its life.
3. Every occurrent has participant(s)
4. Every occurrent is constituted by its participant(s).
5. Every continuant participates in some occurrents.
6. Every continuant is constituted by its participations in occurrents.

6 is there for completeness - but I am not aware of anyone strongly
advocating this.
As you indicate there is no compulsion for the Endurantist to accept any of
these.

One could also have restricted forms of the theses - e.g. every (occurrent)
war is constituted by its participants.

One can also look at whether these is a corresponding Perdurantist thesis. I
think that 4 is interesting - and intuitively comfortable. The
spatio-temporal extent of every 'event' is the fusion (sum) of the (relevant
temporal stage of the) participating bodies. This seem to imply that we
divide up events using bodies as our guides. So there is no portion of an
event that does not belong to some participating body.

You wrote:
"isnt a war rather more than just the participants, even if
they do provide the ontological glue which makes in into a single
happening"

It seems to me that this is all a war is - though I am using participates in
its technical sense to include all the bodies/continuants involves - not
just the countries/people as is sometimes meant. I'm not sure what else
there could be - especially if you are a Perdurantist extensionalist?

You also wrote:
&gt;In neither case are
&gt;continuants (bodies) parts of occurrents (events) simpliciter - whether or
&gt;not you are extensionalist.

Really? Seems to me that if one is a 4-d extensionalist (which I am
on odd-numbered days of the month) then there really is no basic
distinction between thing and event, and then your last claim is
false. For example consider my liver (a body, in this terminology)
and the event consisting of my lifetime.  Barring future medical
disasters, the 4-d extension of the former is entirely inside that of
the latter, so an extensionalist would have to say it is part of it.
Just apply the mereotopological notion of 'part' to the relevant
chunks of 4-space; you can't get much more simpliciter than that.

I agree. But more point was different - and could have been expressed more
clearly - as I suspect you have guessed. "In neither case are continuants
(bodies) *always* parts of occurrents (events) simpliciter - whether or not
you are extensionalist." It is, of course entirely possible that the
participates relation will collapse in some cases to part. However, I think
that it is not true that it always will. For example, it is true (I hope)
that your liver participates (overlaps) with your life now. If (heaven
forbid) the future medical disaster occurs, then you liver will not
participate (be part of) your body then. So participates can be translated
into overlaps, where overlaps has part of as a special case.

Regards,
Chris

Hi Chris

&gt;There are two possible theses here (as I mentioned in my earlier attachment
&gt;on ontological architecture <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03131.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03131.html</A> ).
&gt;A strong thesis - that every occurrent has a unique continuant of which it
&gt;is the life. This seems to lead to an ontology with a built-in redundancy,
&gt;and if you think parsimony is a sensible goal, then there is an opportunity
&gt;to perform an ontological reduction.
&gt;A weak thesis - that every occurrent is composed of the continuants that
&gt;participate in it.

I know people who would reject both of these, I think, but would
claim that every continuant has a unique occurrent called its
lifetime. Your strong thesis seems unncessarily strong. As I
understand the occ/cont contrast (from Peter Simons), the basic idea
is the continuant: occurrents are defined as everything else, so the
set of occurrents is distinctly more ramshackle than that of
continuants. There might be very loose, disorganised occurrents (like
a war, say) which can't be identified with a single continuant.
Nicola and others have insisted that the identity conditions for
occurrents must involve reference to continuants which provide a kind
of 'stitching' through time, or else they (the occurrents) would just
kind of dissolve into a temporal mist, but that doesnt require there
to be a single continuant. And even the weak thesis seems a bit
shaky: isnt a war rather more than just the participants, even if
they do provide the ontological glue which makes in into a single
happening?

&gt;I suspect that you are 'becoming comfortable' with the weak thesis, though
&gt;your examples seem to support the strong thesis.
&gt;
&gt;There are attractive examples illustrating both theses.
&gt;However there also plausible commonsense counterexamples to both theses.
Pat
&gt;has mention a flame and ocean wave as counter-examples of the first thesis.
&gt;A flash of light can be seen as a counter-example of the strong thesis.
&gt;
&gt;Secondly - your concerns about part_of are well-founded:
&gt;If you are a Endurantist (and so hold a continuant-occurrent distinction)
&gt;then you regard the inter-categorical relation as participates not part. If
&gt;you are a Perdurantist (and do not hold the distinction - but may recognize
&gt;a related body-event distinction) you can regard the participates relation
&gt;as overlapping or sharing temporal parts. It all depends upon the choice
&gt;that you make in you ontological architecture. In neither case are
&gt;continuants (bodies) parts of occurrents (events) simpliciter - whether or
&gt;not you are extensionalist.

Really? Seems to me that if one is a 4-d extensionalist (which I am
on odd-numbered days of the month) then there really is no basic
distinction between thing and event, and then your last claim is
false. For example consider my liver (a body, in this terminology)
and the event consisting of my lifetime.  Barring future medical
disasters, the 4-d extension of the former is entirely inside that of
the latter, so an extensionalist would have to say it is part of it.
Just apply the mereotopological notion of 'part' to the relevant
chunks of 4-space; you can't get much more simpliciter than that.
