I like this suggestion very much.  We need a mechanism to make explicit the
various assumptions about what an SUO is, based on how it is to be used.
As an example, there is a thread of thought in the group that the SUO
should be used for person to person communication.  This has been debated
but never resolved in any formal way.  There are assumptions about the
representation language for an upper ontology, again without clear and
detailed agreement about how the content is to be used.  The rigor of a
formal requirements statement seems to be just the ticket at this juncture.

Subject:  SUO: Some Procedural Suggestions




Jim, and  all,

Once again I will  jump into the fray with a few comments and suggestions
for how to  proceed.

It seems to me that  SUO has been making progress, yet three central issues
are  unresolved:

1) What are the  objectives for use of the SUO?

2) What are the  requirements for the SUO?

3) What are the  requirements for the language(s) in which the SUO will be
represented?

Before we can decide  what language to use we need to agree on the
requirements for the language. The  requirements for the language depend on
the requirements for the SUO, which  depend on the objectives for the SUO.

Much of the  discussion in SUO seems to involve these issues while trying
to make progress on  theoretical questions related to the SUO itself. There
needs to be a consensus  on these issues before people can agree about the
value of any proposed  candidate for the SUO, or any proposed elements of
an SUO, though efforts such  as Ian Niles' "merged ontology" are valuable
at least as strawmen to help  identify issues.

The objectives of  the SUO are addressed briefly at the SUO website, in
sections on Scope and  Purpose of the project, though questions still arise
about the  objectives.

Likewise the  requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in the
sections on Scope and  Purpose of the project, yet there are questions that
are unresolved about the  requirements. E.g. the Scope discussion says "an
upper ontology is limited to  concepts that are meta, generic, abstract and
philosophical" yet we have  discussions about whether the ontology should
include "semiotic concepts" or  should only include things that "really
exist" in the world.

The SUO  website lists KIF or the simplified version as the proposed
language for the  standard, without giving a discussion of the requirements
for the language. We  have proposals for alternative languages (e.g.
EXPRESS), and ongoing discussions  about some of the requirements for the
language. E.g. does  the language need to include reflection, does it need
to represent semiotic  concepts, does it need to be a programming language?
Which elements of an SUO  should be built into the language, and which
should be expressed using the  language? Does it need to be a higher-order
language or should SUO be expressed  at the level of first order predicate
calculus,  etc.?

Many such questions  have already been addressed at one time or another in
email threads among the  participants. Yet it appears that there is no way
to determine what has been  resolved or agreed about these questions (and
what is still unresolved) without  reviewing all the email correspondence,
which is not  practical.

To address these  issues, I recommend that the SUO participants take a
standard software  engineering approach, and collaborate on development of
concise yet complete  requirements specifications for the SUO and for its
language.

These requirements  specifications should be located on the SUO web site
and should be working  documents that are iteratively developed, starting
with the current statements  of scope and purpose. I'd recommend that these
specifications be presented in a  "requirements outline" format, where each
requirement or issue is very concisely  stated in a single sentence, and
sub-requirements and issues are added as the  group develops them.
Hyperlinks could be used to give more complete  discussions of the
requirements, issues and resolutions, with pointers to the  email
correspondence about them. We may need to have votes about specific
requirements, to resolve their status.

The precise format  of the requirements outline is not important, but it
should be something that is  very concise yet complete. E.g., something
like the indented table of contents  outline for a standard FAQ would be
useful.

Also, email  correspondence could try to follow a standard of having the
specific  requirement or issue identified in the email subject line, in a
standard way, so  that people can easily see which requirements and
issues are being  discussed, find other relevant email, etc.

Finally, it is clear that there  are distinct differences of opinion among
the participants about the answers to  questions related to requirements
for the SUO and its language. Indeed,  questions about requirements are
"inevitably intertwined"* with theoretical  questions about the design and
implementation of the ontology, and with  theoretical questions about
ontology and knowledge representation in  general. On some of these
questions we may not reach consensus, and the SUO  effort may need to
"fork" and explore alternative answers. This would allow  progress to be
made on multiple paths when it is not clear to everyone which is  the best
path to pursue.

Sincerely,

Phil  Jackson
