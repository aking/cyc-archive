Howard,

I am splicing together the residual loose-ends that I can find of this thread.

Howard Pattee wrote (HP):
Jon Awbrey wrote (JA):

JA: You continue to rush on ahead of my more plodding ways,
    and so I find that I have to keep taking your messages
    in several tries to get through their briar patches.

HP: Take your time.  Ignore my old postings.  I haven't begun to read all your
    posts and links either.  Already your comments are reducing the dissonances.

JA: That would definitely be a novel experience for me!

HP: I am not sure how I fit into this discussion.  Jon obviously has enough comments
    to answer without my adding more.  Anyway, here is another view of  inquiry.  I am
    not sure how Jon's discussion of inquiry gets into the observable world of science.

JA: Pragmaticians are &quot;real&quot; thinkers.  They guess that there is a world beyond them,
    that it has properties -- this is, a little Peirce tells me, the authorized sense
    of the word &quot;real&quot;, as it was originally introduced into our culture's discourse.
    My own experience tells me that this &quot;real world&quot; will just keeping on thumping
    me in the head, as it were, until I pay attention to the features thereof, and
    this forces me, all against my initial inclination, to try to catch its drift.
    All the nets that I have to catch it with are made, in the end, of signs and
    the types of signs that we know as affects, concepts, impressions, or mental
    ideas, and so I must, per force aforesaid, contemplate the relations that
    insist, persist, subsist, or systematicaly exist among these arrays of
    so-called &quot;real&quot; objects, signs, and their host of interpretant signs.

JA: Inserting here a passage from &quot;IDS: III&quot; on the use of the term &quot;real&quot;:

| &quot;Inquiry Driven Systems:  An Inquiry Into Inquiry&quot;, 1.3.4.14,
| &quot;Application of OF [Objective Framework]:  Generic Level&quot;
|
| In spite of the apparent duality between these patterns of
| composition, there is a significant asymmetry to be observed
| in the way that the insistent theme of realism interrupts the
| underlying genre.  To understand what this means, it is necessary
| to note that the strain of pragmatic thinking I am using here takes
| its definition of &quot;reality&quot; from the word's original Scholastic sources,
| where the adjective &quot;real&quot; means &quot;having properties&quot;.  Taken in this sense,
| &quot;reality&quot; is necessary but not sufficient to &quot;actuality&quot;, where the word
| &quot;actual&quot; means &quot;existing in act and not merely potentially&quot; (Webster's).
| To reiterate the same thing from the converse direction, actuality is
| sufficient but not necessary to reality.  The distinction between
| the two ideas is further pointed up by the fact that a potential
| can be real, and that its reality can be independent of any
| particular moment in which the power acts.
|
| These &quot;angelic doctrines&quot; would probably remain distant from
| the present concern, were it not for two points of connection:
|
| 1.  Relative to the present genre, the distinction of reality, that can
|     be granted to certain objects of thought and not to others, fulfills an
|     analogous role to the distinction that singles out &quot;sets&quot; among &quot;classes&quot;
|     in modern versions of set theory.  Taking the membership relation &quot;€&quot; as
|     a predecessor relation in a pre-designated hierarchy of classes, a class
|     attains the status of a set, and by dint of this becomes an object of
|     determinate discussion, simply if it has successors.  Pragmatic reality
|     is distinguished from both the medieval and the modern versions, however,
|     by the fact that its reality is always a reality to someone.  This is due
|     to the circumstance that it takes both an abstract property and a concrete
|     interpreter to establish the practical reality of an object.

HP: Agreed, but only if &quot;sign&quot; is broadly defined as every actual interaction the
    environment has with the organism (physical, sensual, instinctive, semiotic, etc.).

JA: Yes, as a slight bit of look-ahead in my mind's parser tells me, you are well aware that
    the &quot;pragmatic theory of signs&quot; (PTOS) voices the word &quot;sign&quot; with just this expanse
    of liberal breadth.  I occasionally use the phrase &quot;data of the senses&quot; (DOTS) to
    remind my self that all the DOTS that we connect in our percepts and concepts
    are also examples of signs in this sense.  But this is not just another case
    of gratuitous generalization.  What gives the word &quot;sign&quot;, in this employment,
    a technical content, neither exploded nor imploded, and its utility as a term
    of art is just what gives all of our other adoptions, borrowings, conversions,
    or &quot;liftings&quot; of ordinary langauge to technical purposes their meaningful use
    to these ends, to wit, a definition of some order, rough or sharp, whether
    logical or pragmatic or hopefully both.

JA: I have started trying to organize my online links.
    There is the beginning of a cumulative accounting
    appended to the end of this note.  Here is one
    quick link on the &quot;Definition Of A Sign&quot;:

JA: <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02034.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02034.html</A>

JA: Doleful experience has taught me that it is best to expand our focus a bit
    to compass &quot;sign relations&quot;, taken as wholes, over and above just isolated
    signs, and taken at least at first in extension as sets of 3-tuples of the
    form &lt;o, s, i&gt;, with o, s, i the &quot;object&quot;, &quot;sign&quot;, &quot;interpretant sign&quot; of
    the &quot;elementary sign relation&quot; (ESR) &lt;o, s, i&gt;.

JA: At this point, I personally find the comparsion with group theory to be compelling.
    A &quot;group&quot; is another sort of set of 3-tuples that is subject to a terse definition,
    and yet the theory of groups encompasses a wealth of imaginative possibilities and
    utilitarian potentials that can scarcely be con-&amp;-sur-veyed in any finite lifetime.

JA: As it happens, one of my many &quot;returns&quot; to mathematics,
    after a time in the wilds of philosophy and psychology,
    was through the slits of &quot;group representation theory&quot;,
    but the tale thereby hanging is too long to pursue now.

JA: True Story.  There was once in a university library that I knew quite intimately
    a volume on &quot;Group Theory&quot; that had been rebound by the library staff and placed
    on the shelves under the cover of &quot;Group Therapy&quot;.  Moral Of The Story (MOTS):
    The theory of signs is far from being the only subject to have this problem
    of 'what'sin'a'name'.

HP: Incidentally, this universal use of &quot;sign&quot; by Peirce is one of the causes he is
    often misunderstood by scientists and mathematicians (as well as normal people)
    who are accustomed to normal usage that implies a non-arbitrary, causal or
    active (verbal, non-displaceable, spatially and temporally) relation to its
    referent (e.g., fever is a sign or signature or signifier of disease).

HP: A symbol usually implies an arbitrary passive (nominal, displaceable) relation
    to its referent.  This is consistent with etymology as well as common usage.
    (I think C.W. Morris develops this view.)

JA: Charles Morris got this fever of signs from Peirce,
    but what he did to remediate it is the subject of
    many a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ..., opinion, if not many
    a knock-down-drag-out among and between analytic
    and pragmatic doctors.  I will try to tiptoe
    past the sleeping dogmas without pausing to
    enumerate their heads ...

JA: But I will need to introduce the technical distinctions and relations, deployed in PTOS,
    of terms like &quot;sign&quot; (the genus), in relation to &quot;icon&quot;, &quot;index&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; (the species):

JA, quoting and correcting JA, outlining and interpreting CSP:

  | For future reference, here is a primer for the
  | classification of signs in Peircean semiotics:
  |
  |.Sign
  |....Icon
  |....Index
  |....Symbol
  |.......Term
  |.......Proposition
  |.......Argument
  |..........Abduction
  |..........Induction
  |..........Deduction
  |
  | Cf. Max Fisch, &quot;Introduction&quot;, page xxxii, in C.S. Peirce,
  |'Writings of Charles S. Peirce: A Chronological Edition',
  |'Volume 1, 1857-1866', Peirce Edition Project,
  | Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN, 1982.
  |
  | By &quot;primer&quot;, of course, you may catch my drift
  | that the whole scheme of classification is set
  | to &quot;blow up&quot; from this point on, but this much
  | will do for a start, &amp; for my present purposes.
  |
  | It needs to be understood that this scheme classifies
  | the aspects of functioning or the modes of being that
  | any sign may have to some degree, and that almost any
  | concrete token of a truly effective sign is likely to
  | have in a significant measure.  So let us not jump to
  | the facile conclusion that this scheme, or any of the
  | many schemes that develop, expand, and refine it, are
  | meant to be taken as mutually exclusive categories of
  | the signs themselves, even if the whole array of them
  | aspires, perhaps, to a certain form of exhaustiveness.
  |
  | My immediate purpose, on the present occasion, is to
  | begin pinning down the slippery concept of a concept,
  | in other words, to provide our notions of a notion
  | with a provisional placement in the semiotic plan.
  |
  | The way I see it (TWISI), a concept is just a sign
  | in the mind, in particular, a symbol, which is the
  | kind of a sign that depends for its interpretation
  | in an especially integral way on the sign relation
  | as a whole, which whole sign relation is typically
  | personified in the hypostasis of an &quot;interpreter&quot;.
  |
  | This means that a concept has a significant portion
  | of its properties accounted for by its standing as
  | a symbol, by the mere fact of its membership among
  | that non-exclusive tribe of signs called &quot;symbols&quot;,
  | which it only partly derives from its mental locus,
  | and this aside from the manifest aspects of an index
  | or the manifold attributes of an icon that it has by
  | dint of being an &quot;affection or impression of the soul&quot;.

HP: For example, in mathematics we have the noun symbols, x, y, etc.
    and the verb signs, +, =, etc.  We speak of the &quot;plus sign&quot; because
    it is an operation (that must be performed where and when indicated),
    and the &quot;symbol, x,&quot; because it stands, passively, wherever and whenever
    we write it, for whatever we choose.  We also speak of a &quot;STOP sign&quot; because
    in this case the symbol &quot;STOP&quot; is functioning as a verb, a non-displaceable
    operation (actually, it stands for an elliptical imperative sentence:
    &quot;You STOP here and now.&quot;).  I won't go into Peirce's other numerous
    eccentric terminologies.

JA: That's okay, I probably will.

HP: As a non-logician, it seems to me Jon is just inquiring
    into Peirce and logical strings and graphs.  If this is
    Peirce's main contribution I can understand why scientists
    do not pay him much attention.  Inquiry to most scientists
    does not really depend on this type of logical analysis,
    but on imagination and observation.  I don't know of any
    cases of discovery in science, or even mathematics, where
    logical analysis played the creative role.  Of course, in
    math proofs require logic, but rarely is logic the source
    of the inquiry.

JA: I am guessing then that you are one of those who does not consider
    this art that we call &quot;computer science&quot; to be a &quot;real&quot; science?

HP: Again, if you don't want to make finer distinctions, then science can mean
    any form of knowledge, just like sign can mean any interaction with an agent.
    I think it is conceptually useful to make a distinction between formal, or
    purely syntactical activities, and activities that require observation or
    measurement. I think most mathematicians and computer theorists strive
    for purely formal systems that can be operated measurement-free and
    semantics-free.  I'm not sure about logicians.  Mostly they try to
    be formalists, but because they often use natural language, they
    cannot prevent tacit semantic biases from slipping in.  I think
    it is an open question whether complete formalism is possible,
    even in mathematics.  I doubt it.  But nevertheless, the ideal
    is worth imagining.

HP: I think for most scientists &quot;inquiry&quot; means exploration
    or looking for something entirely new in our experience.
    After all, modern scientific inquiry did not begin with
    logic but with the extension of our natural senses by
    instruments and by the extension of our natural imagination
    by mathematics.  Modern biology began with the microscope,
    chemistry with the analytic balance and chemical indicators,
    and physics with the telescope, theodolite, and mathematics.

JA: Ah, the &quot;2001: A Space Oddity&quot; picture of science!
    These instruments just fell from the sky one day,
    and science began.  It would explain a lot of
    this cargo cultism that I see about me today,
    but I have another picture of the motion.

HP: I don't appreciate the point of your sarcasm.  What did I actually say that you dispute?
    I did not mean to imply that instruments are sufficient for science, but I think they
    are necessary.  The naked eye sees very little of the universe, large and small.
    As an old instrument-maker myself (I designed and constructed the first compound
    x-ray optics the likes of which are used in the Chandra telescope:

    <A  HREF="http://chandra.harvard.edu/">http://chandra.harvard.edu/</A>

    I can assure you that instruments do not &quot;just fall from the sky&quot;
    (although Chandra will, literally, only too soon.)

HP: Chronometers, galvanometers, spectroscope, mass spectrometers, centrifuges,
    chromatography, radioactive tracers, particle accelerators, and especially
    mathematics, are the essential prostheses for our senses and brains without
    which scientific inquiry would have come to a dead end like scholasticism.

JA: Yes, I came to the university as a post-sputnik era math and physics major,
    and so I heard all the same stories of history, read all the same romantic
    accounts of our noble climb from pre-historical slime (=&lt; 1901), but then
    I made the &quot;experiment&quot; of actually going out and &quot;observing&quot; what was
    actually laid down in some of the old &quot;fossil pits&quot;, and lo and behold
    I discovered that our &quot;ascent&quot; was far more gradual and rule-governed
    than all these romantic novel-ists had been catechizing me to believe.

HP: I agree that too many intelligent students like you received a very bad education.
    I am glad you have learned to observe and inquire for yourself.

HP: The real problem for scientific inquiry is:  How do we know what are we looking for?
    This is an old problem.  Meno asked Socrates, &quot;But how will you look for something
    when you don't in the least know what it is?  How on earth are you going to set up
    something you don't know as the object of your search?  To put it another way, even
    if you come right up against it, how will you know that what you have found is the
    thing you didn't know?&quot;  This is the big question, but Socrates gives one of his
    sillier answers:  &quot;The soul, since it is immortal and has been born many times,
    and has seen all things both here and in the other world, has learned everything
    that there is.&quot;  Therefore, he concludes:  &quot;learning is nothing but recollection.&quot;

JA: Here, now, Howard, you have, in your own inimitable way, a way that I would not even
    dare to attempt to imitate, brought us to the very hub and nub of the Big Question.
    So I will fortify myself with another cup of coffee, and return with anticipation.

HP: I will also temporarily break off here and take a nap.

JA: Yes, logic, by any other name, is known for its dormitive virtues.

I'm back ...

On my application to graduate school the last time around, in Systems Engineering,
I was requested to submit a few written pages by way of an &quot;Interest Statement&quot;.
I probably don't have to tell you what happened next.  Here is an excerpt
from the little essay that issued forth:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~ARCHIVE~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Inquiring Minds,

This selection explains the notion of a &quot;knowledge field&quot; (KF) and
brings us back through the point where we first came in, with the
problematics that are classically illustrated in Plato's 'Meno'.

1.1.2.1  Vector Field &amp; Control System

Dynamically, as in a control system, intelligence is a decision process that
selects an indicator of a tangent vector to follow at a point or a descriptor
of a corresponding operator to apply at a point.  The pointwise indicators
or descriptors can be any relevant signs or symbolic expressions:  names,
code numbers, address pointers, or quoted phrases.  A &quot;vector field&quot; attaches
to each point of phase space a single tangent vector or differential operator.
The &quot;control system&quot; is viewed as a ready generalization of a vector field, in
which whole sets of tangent vectors or differential operators are attached to
each point of phase space.  The &quot;strategy&quot; or &quot;policy problem&quot; of a controller
is to pick out one of these vectors to actualize at each point in accord with
reaching a given target or satisfying a given property.  An individual control
system is specified by information attached to each dynamic point that defines
a subset of the tangent space at that point.  This pointwise defined subset is
called &quot;the indicatrix of permissible velocities&quot; by (Arnold, 1986, ch. 11).

In the usage needed for combining AI and control systems to obtain
autonomous intelligent systems, it is important to recognize that the
pointwise indicators and descriptors must eventually have the character
of symbolic expressions existing in a language of non-trivial complexity.
Relating to this purpose, it does not really matter if their information
is viewed as represented in the states of discrete machines or in the
states of physical systems to which real and complex valued measurements
are attributed.  What makes the system of indications and descriptions
into a language is that its elements obey specific sets of axioms that
come to be recognized as characterizing interesting classes of symbol
systems.  Later on I will indicate one very broad definition of signs 
and symbol systems that I favor.  I find that this conception of signs
and languages equips the discussion of intelligent systems with an
indispensable handle on the levels of complexity that arise in their
description, analysis, and clarification.

1.1.2.2  Fields of Information &amp; Knowledge

Successive extensions of the vector field concept can be achieved by 
generalizing the form of pointwise information defined on a phase space.
A subset of a tangent space at a point can be viewed as a boolean-valued
function there, and as such can be generalized to a probability distribution
that is defined on the tangent space at that point.  This type of probabilistic
vector field or &quot;information field&quot; founds the subject of stochastic differential
geometry and its associated dynamic systems.  An alternate development in this
spirit might embody pointwise information about tangent vectors in the form of
linguistic expressions and ultimately in knowledge bases with the character of
empirical summaries or logical theories attached to each point of a phase space.

It is convenient to bring together under the heading of a &quot;knowledge field&quot; any
form of pointwise information, symbolic or numerical, concrete or theoretical,
that constrains the set of pointwise tangent vectors defined on a phase space.
In computational settings this information can be procedural and declarative
program code augmented by statistical and qualitative data.  In computing
applications a knowledge field acquires an aptly suggestive visual image:
bits and pieces of code and data elements sprinkled on a dynamic surface,
like bread crumbs to be followed through a forest.  The rewards and dangers
of so literally a &quot;distributed&quot; manner of information storage are extremely
well-documented (Hansel &amp; Gretel, n.d.), but there are times when it provides
the only means available.

1.1.2.3  The Trees &amp; The Forest

A sticking point of the whole discussion has just been
reached.  In the idyllic setting of a knowledge field the
question of systematic inquiry takes on the following form:

What piece of code should be followed in order to discover that code?

It is a classic catch, whose pattern was traced out long ago in the paradox
of Plato's 'Meno'.  Discussion of this dialogue and of the task it sets for
AI, cognitive science, education, including the design of intelligent tutoring
systems, can be found in (H. Gardner, 1985), (Chomsky, 1965, '72, '75, '80, '86),
(Fodor, 1975, 1983), (Piattelli-Palmarini, 1980), and in (Collins &amp; Stevens, 1991).
Though it appears to mask a legion of diversions, this text will present itself at
least twice more in the current engagement, both on the horizon and at the gates
of the project to fathom and to build intelligent systems.  Therefore, it is
worth recalling how this inquiry begins.  The interlocutor Meno asks:

| Can you tell me, Socrates, whether virtue can be taught,
| or is acquired by practice, not teaching?  Or if neither
| by practice nor by learning, whether it comes to mankind
| by nature or in some other way?  (Plato, 'Meno', p. 265).

Whether the word &quot;virtue&quot; (arete) is interpreted to mean virtuosity
in some special skill or a more general excellence of conduct, it is
evidently easy, in the understandable rush to &quot;knowledge&quot;, to forget
or to ignore what the primary subject of this dialogue is.  Only when
the difficulties of the original question, whether virtue is teachable,
have been moderated by a tentative analysis does knowledge itself become
a topic of the conversation.  This hypothetical mediation of the problem
takes the following tack:  If virtue were a kind of knowledge, and if
every kind of knowledge could be taught, would it not follow that
virtue could be taught?

For the present purpose, it should be recognized that this &quot;trial factorization&quot;
of a problem space or phenomenal field is an important intellectual act in itself,
one that deserves attention in the effort to understand the competencies that
support intelligent functioning.  It is a good question to ask just what sort
of reasoning processes might be involved in the ability to find such a middle
term, as is served by &quot;knowledge&quot; in the example at hand.  Generally speaking,
interest will reside in a whole system of middle terms, which might be called
a &quot;medium&quot; of the problem domain or the field of phenomena.  This usage makes
plain the circumstance that the very recognition and expression of a problem
or phenomenon is already contingent upon and complicit with a particular set
of hypotheses that will inform the direction of its resolution or explanation.

One of the chief theoretical difficulties that obstructs the unification of
logic and dynamics in the study of intelligent systems can be seen in relation
to this question of how an intelligent agent might generate tentative but plausible
analyses of problems that confront it.  As described here, this requires a capacity
for identifying middle grounds that ameliorate or mollify a problem.  This facile
ability does not render any kind of demonstrative argument to be trusted in the
end and for all time, but is a temporizing measure, a way of locating test media
and of trying cases in the media selected.  It is easy to criticize such practices,
to say that every argument should be finally cast into a deductively canonized form,
harder to figure out how to live in the mean time without using such half-measures
of reasoning.  There is a line of thinking, extending from this reference point
in Plato through a glancing remark by Aristotle to the notice of C.S. Peirce,
which holds that the form of reasoning required to accomplish this feat is
neither inductive nor deductive and reduces to no combination of the two,
but is an independent type.

Aristotle called this form of reasoning &quot;apagogy&quot; ('Prior Analytics', 2.25)
and it was variously translated throughout the Middle Ages as &quot;reduction&quot; or
&quot;abduction&quot;.  The sense of &quot;reduction&quot; here is just that by which one question
or problem is said to reduce to another, as in the AI strategy of goal reduction.
Abductive reasoning is also involved in the initial creation or apt generation of
hypotheses, as in diagnostic reasoning.  Thus, it is natural that abductive reasoning
has periodically become a topic of interest in AI and cognitive modeling, especially
in the effort to build expert systems that simulate and assist diagnosis, whether in
human medicine, auto mechanics, or electronic trouble-shooting.  Recent explorations
in this vein are exemplified by (Peng &amp; Reggia, 1990) and (O'Rorke, 1990).

But there is another reason why the factorization problem presents an especially
acute obstacle to progress in the system-theoretic approach to AI.  When the states
of a system are viewed as a manifold it is usual to imagine that everything factors
nicely into a base manifold and a remainder.  Smooth surfaces come to mind, a single
clear picture of a system that is immanently good for all time.  But this is how an
outside observer might see it, not how it appears to the inquiring system that is
located in a single point and has to discover, starting from there, the most fitting
description of its own space.  The proper division of a state vector into basic and
derivative factors is itself an item of knowledge to be discovered.  It constitutes
a piece of interpretive knowledge that has a large part in determining exactly how
an agent behaves.  The tentative hypotheses that an agent spins out with respect to
this issue will themselves need to be accommodated in a component of free space that
is well under control.  Without a stable theater of action for entertaining hypotheses,
an agent finds it difficult to sustain interest in the kinds of speculative bets that
are required to fund a complex inquiry.

States of information with respect to the placement of this fret or fulcrum can
vary with time.  Indeed, it is a goal of the knowledge directed system to leverage
this chordal node toward optimal possibilities, and this normally requires a continuing
interplay of experimental variations with attunement to the results.  Therefore it seems
necessary to develop a view of manifolds in which the location or depth of the primary
division that is effective in explaining behavior can vary from moment to moment.
The total phenomenal state of a system is its most fundamental reality, but the
way in which these states are connected to make a space, with information that
metes out distances, portrays curvatures, and binds fibers into bundles --
all this is an illusion projected onto the mist of individual states
from items of code in the knowledge component of the current state.

The mathematical and computational tools needed to implement such a perspective
goes beyond the understanding of systems and their spaces that I currently have
in my command.  It is considered bad form for a workman to blame his tools, but
in practical terms there continues to be room for better design.  The languages
and media that are made available do, indeed, make some things easier to see,
to say, and to do than others, whether it is English, Pascal (Wirth, 1976),
or Hopi (Whorf, 1956) that is being spoken.  A persistent attention to this
pragmatic factor in epistemology will be necessary to implement the brands
of knowledge-directed systems whose intelligence can function in real time.
To provide a computational language that can help to clarify these problems
is one of the chief theoretical tasks that I see for myself in the work ahead.

A system moving through a knowledge field would ideally be equipped with
a strategy for discovering the structure of that field to the greatest extent
possible.  That ideal strategy is a piece of knowledge, a segment of code existing
in the knowledge space of every point that has this option within its potential.
Does discovery mark only a different awareness of something that already exists,
a changed attitude toward a piece of knowledge already possessed?  Or can it be
something more substantial?  Are genuine invention and proper extensions of the
shared code possible?  Can intelligent systems acquire pieces of knowledge that
are not already in their possession, or in their potential to know?

If a piece of code is near at hand, within a small neighborhood of a system's place in
a knowledge field, then it is easy to see a relationship between adherence and discovery.
It is possible to picture how crumbs of code could be traced back, accumulated, and gradually
reassembled into whole slices of the desired program.  But what if the required code is more
distant?  If a system is observed in fact to drift toward increasing states of knowledge,
does its disposition toward knowledge as a goal need to be explained by some inherent
attraction of knowledge?  Do potential fields and propagating influences have to be
imagined in order to explain the apparent action at a distance?  Do massive bodies
of knowledge then naturally form, and eventually come to dominate whole knowledge
fields?  Are some bodies of knowledge intrinsically more attractive than others?
Can inquiries get so serious that they start to radiate gravity?

Questions like these are only ways of probing the range of possible systems that
are implied by the definition of a knowledge field.  What abstract possibility best
describes a given concrete system is a separate, empirical question.  With luck, the
human situation will be found among the reasonably learnable universes, but before that
hope can be evaluated a lot remains to be discovered about what, in fact, may be learnable
and reasonable.

Enuff for now ...

HP: It is not the metaphysics of reincarnation that is silly here (I'm in favor of it).
    It is Socrates' lack of understanding of problem identification.  As we are all too
    well aware today, if you don't know what you are looking for, access to an infinite
    database (no matter how well indexed, and whether it is in an immortal soul or in an
    infinitely fast computer) is not a solution.  In fact, the more the data, the worse
    the problem.  You still don't know what you are looking for.  I think Peirce worried
    about this problem too, but I don't think he found an adequate answer.  Jon may have
    another opinion.

HP: There have been two extreme approaches to this problem.
    At one extreme is the assumption of initial total ignorance.
    Then blind search and natural selection is the only hope.
    Of course, this requires many trials and memory of failures
    and successes (i.e., the Darwinian solution:  replication,
    heritable variation, and natural selection, also assumed by
    evolutionary epistemologists, a la Campbell, Popper, et al.).

HP: The other extreme, a physical equivalent of Socrates omniscient soul,
    is a Laplacean omnipotent determinism where free will and ignorance are
    just illusions and have nothing to do with the inexorable course of events.
    Neither of these extremes alone makes much sense in terms of current physics
    and biology.  Today the active controversy in evolution is over finding a suitable
    balance between chance and determinism, that is, between Darwinian blind search and
    selection and non-selective self-organizing (dynamic) processes.

HP: I think there are two misconceptions of the search problem.
    The first is that the search space it too large.  The main
    criticism of the creationists, intelligent design theists,
    and even the self-organizing anti-Darwinians, is that the
    search space for the totally ignorant is so large that
    successful blind search is too improbable.  But the
    evidence is clear that in the course of evolution
    organisms have greatly increased their searchable
    domains by adding more sensors and motor controls;
    and as I pointed out above, science also depends for
    its progress on greatly increasing its searchable domains
    by instrumentation.  Enlarging the searchable domain is not
    the problem, it is part of the answer to evolution and learning.
    What would be the evolutionary future of organisms if their inquiries
    were restricted to a fixed set of sensors (or a fixed logic)?

HP: The second misconception is that &quot;blind&quot; applies to the entire search process.
    But &quot;blind&quot; applies only to a simple initial event in a highly organized living
    system that has adapted to a highly ordered environment.  This is a genetic form
    or analog of intelligence.  Similarly, there is at some level in every creative
    idea a blind search, but usually in the context of highly developed problem domain.

HP: I think the most significant change in attitudes towards this balance between
    determinism and chance in the last 20 years has been the loss of dominance of
    logic-based, hard-programmed problem-solving, as in GOFAI (good old fashioned AI)
    and the renewed appreciation of the power of biological analogs like neural nets
    and genetic algorithms to discover solutions and integrate behaviors.

HP: Most important, however, has been the realization that blind search
    and selection requires strong, open-ended interactions with a rich,
    highly-ordered (i.e., descriptively compressible) environment (as has
    been partially simulated by environmentally &quot;embedded autonomous robots&quot;)
    What is still missing in these robots is the open-ended ability to construct
    new sensors.  It appears that only with this unrestricted &quot;sensing&quot; of a rich,
    ordered environment does a balanced coupling of self-organization and blind search
    and natural selection become effective.

HP: Here are a few references on these points:

    Brooks, R., &quot;Intelligence without reason.&quot;  In 12th Int. Conf. on AI, Morgan Kauffman, 1991.

    Open Court, 1974.

    and effectors.&quot;  In Artificial Life II, Langton, et al, eds., Addison-Wesley, 1992.

    Dawkins, R., &quot;The evolution of evolution.&quot; Artificial life I, Langton, ed.,
    Addison-Wesley, 1989, p.201.

HP: This is one view of inquiry.  I suspect I am missing something about Jon's view.
