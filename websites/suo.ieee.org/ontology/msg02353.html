Strand 3.  Embedded Tables &amp; Extended Relations

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

JA:  There were a few issues about "embedded", "indexed", "keyed",
     or "ordered" relational tables that were initially raised in
     the present frame, and so I will try to address them now, at
     least until the running accumulation of bits grows too large.

JA:  This filiation is offspring to your comment that,
     with regard to your putative method of reduction:

     | MW:  Where I come from this method would
     |      be informally known as reification.

JA:  Having seen more of your elaboration of what you are
     actually doing, I begin to see this more as a matter
     of two kinds of embedding that you are carrying out
     on the given relation, and one of these brands of
     embedding, extension, or extenuation does exhibit
     a relation to the operation that is classically
     known as "hypostatic abstraction", or else as
     "reification".  But all of these operations
     act to increase the arity of the relation,
     so I really do not see how they help the
     case that you want to establish.  I have
     sorted out these questions for separate
     discussion in this note.

JA:  Concreteness in the beginning is hardly misplaced,
     so let us consider a discreetly simple example of
     a relational database, just to pick one at random
     from off the grainy strand beneath our feet, here:

JA:  Relation L(&amp;) = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x &amp; y = z}.

     o-----o-----o---------o
     |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
     o-----o-----o---------o
     |  0  |  0  |    0    |
     |  0  |  1  |    0    |
     |  1  |  0  |    0    |
     |  1  |  1  |    1    |
     o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  There are many different ways to embed a k-adic relational table
     in a more spacious and sumptious table, that is, one that enjoys
     either more rows or more columns or both, and with whatever form
     of extenutaion is chosen to extend the relation thus represented
     either to larger samples of its initial cartesian product domain,
     or else to relations of augmented audacity, arete, or valoration.

JA:  But you have already instanced for me the two most common types
     of embedding or extension, and so it is meet that we take these
     up first.  Let us just contemplate their basic forms all in one
     place, and leave off discussing the details to later in the day.

JA:  Extension 1.  Abstract Hypostasy, Reflective Entitlement.

     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    t    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  0  |  0  |    0    |
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  0  |  1  |    0    |
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  1  |  0  |    0    |
     | "L(&amp;)"  |  1  |  1  |    1    |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o

MW:  I don't follow this.

No, you precede it.  That is to say, you have already
invoked by implication an example of this particular
type of construction -- which to my way of thinking
is more like a genuine "reification" of a relation
than the alternative construction, which might be
said to reify each of the tuples independently,
I guess, if you really had to stretch a point --
anyway, you did something tantamount to this
when you gave names to the relational tables
for L0 and L1, back on the strand where we
were discussing your purported reduction.
I repeat the development as we left it:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~INTRUSION~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

JA:  Here begins your putative translation of L0 &amp; L1
     into 2-adic form.  If I understand you correctly,
     for i = 0, 1, for j = 1, 2, 3, 4, and for r, s, t
     in B, the following sort of schema:

     |   (L&lt;i&gt;-row L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt;)
     |   (x L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; r)
     |   (y L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; s)
     |   (z L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; t)

     is intended to say that:

     |   L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is a row in L&lt;i&gt;
     |   and the x position in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is r
     |   and the y position in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is s
     |   and the z position in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is t.

JA:  No doubt you will regard it as "tria-some" of me
     to keep reminding you that each and every one of
     those tokens of your truth-functional connective
     "and" is an invocation of a 3-adic relation, and
     that the mere magical practice of muttering them
     under one's breath does not a single bit of good
     to cancel what your moving finger omits to write,
     nor serve to wish away the adamant computational
     reality of the hard, logical, &amp; unyielding facts.

JA:  But I believe that all of that, "banal truism" that
     it may indeed reflect, has now become but the least
     of your problems, due to all these "brave new words"
     that you have added to make up the translated text.

JA:  Let me now accord you the benefit of a certain doubt,
     and presume that your schema is to be read like this:

     |   L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is a row in L&lt;i&gt;
     |   and the-x-position-in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is r
     |   and the-y-position-in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is s
     |   and the-z-position-in L&lt;i&gt;-row&lt;j&gt; is t.

     Here, the hyphenated phrases:

     |   the-x-position-in,
     |   the-y-position-in,
     |   the-x-position-in,

     can be read as the names of three 2-adic relations,
     in particular, functions, that can be written just
     a little more concisely and conventionally in this
     rather more standard -- standard to many -- manner:

     |   Proj&lt;k&gt; : T x U -&gt; B, for k = 1, 2, 3,

     respectively.  Here, rather than making up yet another
     new series of names, I am leaving it to the context to
     mark the fact that these Proj's are a suitable sort of
     "extended projections", which take the name of a Table
     in the set T and the number of a Row in the set U, and
     yield the value in the indicated column k, k = 1, 2, 3.

JA:  Well, these are fine and dandy brands of operation,
     but there are a couple of things that they are not:

     1.  They are not less than or equal to 2-adic in their arity.
     2.  They do not translate the content of the original tables.

JA:  Let me now establish these two claims.

     1.  That these "extended or generalized projections",
         Proj&lt;k&gt; : T x U -&gt; B, in this case for k = 1, 2, 3,
         with T being a domain of tables or else their names,
         with U being a domain of row numbers, of a proper sort,
         and where k is a column number, of an appropriate kind,
         go beyond being 2-adic in their arities or valencies --
         I believe this to be clear on the face of it, and so
         perhaps the only question is whether any person has
         perpetrated an impertinence by bringing them into
         the fray, but it was you who invited them to the
         party -- all I did nothing more outré than more
         formally to introduce them, quite as I earlier
         promised that I should, and so I will simply
         have to leave it to you to answer for their
         conduct and their bearing on the affairs
         at stake.

     2.  Let us recall that we have all agreed, at least, so long as we continue
         on our present extensional course, that a relation is a "set" of tuples,
         and by a set to say we end the cardinal account and the thousand numbed
         shocks that a keyed-up table is heir to,- 'tis a summarization devoutly
         to be wish'd.  To set! perchance to forget: -- AI, there's the rub that
         erases all the numb and getting number identifiers that shuffle off our
         more tabular coil.

         Where was I -- halfway gone on vacation, that's where! --
         but miles to go, for a' that ...

JA:  The message here is just what I tried to advise you about
     from the very beginnings of my entry into this exposition,
     namely, that indexed, keyed, ordered, or sequenced tables
     are not legitimate ways of addressing this problem, among
     other things, because they convert a set of tuples into a
     list of tuples or a sequence of tuples, which is a rather
     distinct mathematical object or data structure, no matter
     how one chooses to look at it.

In the examples of L0 and L1, you were using both types
of extension at once, in effect, as if to create these
two relational tables:

|   Extension of Relation L0.
|   L0 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 0 mod 2}.
|
|   o---------o-----o-----o-----o-----o
|   |    t    |  u  |  x  |  y  |  z  |
|   o---------o-----o-----o-----o-----o
|   |  "L0"   |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
|   |  "L0"   |  2  |  0  |  1  |  1  |
|   |  "L0"   |  3  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
|   |  "L0"   |  4  |  1  |  1  |  0  |
|   o---------o-----o-----o-----o-----o

|   Extension of Relation L1.
|   Relation L1 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 1 mod 2}.
|
|   o---------o-----o-----o-----o-----o
|   |    t    |  u  |  x  |  y  |  z  |
|   o---------o-----o-----o-----o-----o
|   |  "L1"   |  1  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
|   |  "L1"   |  2  |  0  |  1  |  0  |
|   |  "L1"   |  3  |  1  |  0  |  0  |
|   |  "L1"   |  4  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
|   o---------o-----o-----o-----o-----o

The names of the tables are kept in quotes,
so nobody will think that we mean to embed
copies of the entire relational tables at
the locations where they are being cited.
Some folks would otherwise think that.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~NOISURTNI~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

JA:  Extension 2.  Indexing, Keying, Ordering, Sequencing.

     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    n    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    1    |  0  |  0  |    0    |
     |    2    |  0  |  1  |    0    |
     |    3    |  1  |  0  |    0    |
     |    4    |  1  |  1  |    1    |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  Some of the names, of course, are not yet standard.

MW:  In the interests of clarity, this can be seen as an
     intermediate step in the transformation I am making.

MW:  Having introduced the index (the reification step)
     then each of the components of each row is related
     to that index.  This gives you a basis for creating
     a relation for each column, so:

MW:  n  = {1,2,3,4}

     x = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,0&gt;, &lt;3,1&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}

     y = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,1&gt;, &lt;3,0&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}

     z = {&lt;1,0&gt;, &lt;2,0&gt;, &lt;3,0&gt;, &lt;4,1&gt;}

MW:  I fail to see why you think x, y, z are not relations.
     I have swopped 1 tradic relation for 3 dyadic relations
     plus a set.

JA:  Unhuh, and are these three 2-adic relations
     just hanging out there, blowing in the wind,
     as if they were to wash up on the shores of
     your certainty, each one a detached message,
     all dispersed in welters of many-splintered
     brands and colors of bottles, that the wine
     darks seas of the world give up to you, and
     you, on receipt of this gift, how would you
     even know that each message had any bearing
     on the meaning of the others, if not by way
     of some clue that you can persieve or purse
     seine or just plain abdeuce to be contained
     therein, read between the letters and lines?

MW:  Not at all, they are linked by the objects
     they contain (though it would be sensible not
     to use 1,2,3,4 as the index as you have done
     since at least 1 is also used to represent
     a different object in the matrix).

JA:  And are these characters, in their pedigree,
     any kind'o'kin to the gang'o'four you hinge
     them on, or do they hang but separately, as
     nothing but instances of one dummy variable
     after'n'other?

MW:  Very colourful, but you lost me.

MW:  It is relatively straight forward to do the
     transformation in each direction, so they
     are equivalent.

JA:  Not so.

JA:  You must remember this:
     A set is still a set,
     as the index goes by.

JA:  Consider an "indexed 3-adic relation",
     which is really this 4-adic relation:

     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    n    |  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o
     |    1    |  1  |  1  |    1    |
     |    2    |  1  |  0  |    0    |
     |    3    |  0  |  1  |    0    |
     |    4    |  0  |  0  |    0    |
     o---------o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  This is a distinct 4-adic relation that might
     well arise in any number of applications from
     what is fundamentally the same 3-adic relation.
     Indeed, there are 4! = 24 distinct such 4-adics
     that may easily arise in one setting or another
     out of the same 3-adic relation that we had in
     the beginning.  

MW:  I don't follow this move.  To me 1,2,3,4 are (or should be)
     unique object identifiers in the Universe of Discourse
     (1 isn't here so there is a problem).

Here's another experiment for you.  Go visit your Local Data Group,
and this time tell them that due to the adoption of the world-wide
"Universal Row Locator" (URL) protocols, all of the rows in all of
the relational data tables in all of your company's wholly onerous
sudsydairies will have to be given unique identifiers, after which
all of these Brave New URL's will have to be checked against those
being used by anybody in any table anywhere else in the world just
to be sure that there are absolutely no coincidences.  And, oh, by
the way, while they are at it, somebody had really better think up
a new name to replace this name for the "URL" Protocols themselves,
because, after all, that name is already taken.

JA:  So the mapping is not 1 to 1, but 1 to 24, and this
     does not make for any kind of invertible transformation,
     nor any kind of equivalence between formal objects.

JA:  You have come to the very threshold of teridentity, my friend.

MW:  Save me, save me!!!!
