&gt; &gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have visited your "neck of the webs" several times,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I tend to get lost in it because the frame system
&gt; &gt; &gt; does not let me leave a suitable trail of "bread crumbs" --
&gt; &gt; &gt; The sight of all those pyramids gave me a start at first --
&gt; &gt; &gt; I tend to think "yet another hierarchy" (YAH) when I see
&gt; &gt; &gt; contemplative edifices like that -- especially when I read
&gt; &gt; &gt; further that their "foundations" are on "top", but still,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am attracted to almost anything that tries to get the
&gt; &gt; &gt; "ground" off the "plane", so I persisted.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is the trail that I followed, such as I can record:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Note:  My fairly up-to-date NetScraper cannot read the pages
&gt; &gt; &gt; that are displayed by the "EDMvisualExpress WEB publisher".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  There is a ZIP file you can download with an HTML version
&gt; &gt; of the model.  Have you tried that?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  I am currently working with others on an update to that model
&gt; &gt; which should both simplify and enhance its capability.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, bactrack, and continue ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://www.iso18876.org/">http://www.iso18876.org/</A>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://www.iso18876.org/iso18876/index.html">http://www.iso18876.org/iso18876/index.html</A>
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Yep this is home for the integration architecture stuff.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And finally I get to here:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; | Mattheew West,
&gt; &gt; &gt; | "SO/WD 18876-1 Integration of industrial data
&gt; &gt; &gt; | for exchange, access, and sharing --
&gt; &gt; &gt; | Part 1:  Architecture overview and description"
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this the right place?  At least one of them?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Yes.  Another one to try to find is the SC4 Data Architecture
&gt; &gt; Preliminary Work Item page, where you should be able to find links
&gt; &gt; to "Some notes on the nature of things" and the EXIST language,
&gt; &gt; amongst other things.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is some interesting looking stuff here,
&gt; &gt; &gt; especially the pictures, but I am presently
&gt; &gt; &gt; obstructed in the reading of it by the fact
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I no longer know who in this group uses
&gt; &gt; &gt; words like "class", "union", "intersection",
&gt; &gt; &gt; and so on, in the ways that I am used to use
&gt; &gt; &gt; them and who is not -- maybe you are, I just
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot be sure anymore.  So this would take
&gt; &gt; &gt; some clarification if I was to try to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; any deeper into the architecture of it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Class, a set to which we attach some significance.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, good.  I believe that this admirable notion of
&gt; "a collection to which we attach some significance",

MW: I agree with the unstated correction.

&gt; under any other name, is one that we definitely need
&gt; to keep in mind, and to which we ought to pay rather
&gt; a bit more of additional and concentrated attention.
&gt; 
&gt; But, just by way of allowing us to keep on talking
&gt; to logicians and to mathematicians -- you know how
&gt; they are! -- and by way of avoiding the inevitable
&gt; confusion that is bound to follow from using these
&gt; terms at odds with the way that they already do --
&gt; we must be flexible since they obviously cannot --
&gt; let me just suggest that we look around for another
&gt; way to describe our sense of the significant object.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not yet sure if this would work -- we will just
&gt; have to see -- but it may be feasible to forge a not
&gt; too confounding and too entangling link with the not
&gt; unrelated topic of "natural kinds" if we contemplate
&gt; using the word "kind" to describe the brand of class,
&gt; the type of set, or the cast of a class in such role
&gt; as you appear to have in mind here.  Let us try fora
&gt; bit and see, may we, just as a kind of an experiment?
&gt; 
&gt; If that brand of compromise does not work out, then
&gt; we may have to seek out an altogether new neologism --
&gt; if you will excuse my tautologism, and I think that
&gt; you know how much I would hate to have to do that!? --
&gt; for example, in the latest cast of my 'dissipation'
&gt; I have been using the phrase "indexed set" to speak
&gt; of a reasonable facsimile of this very notion, that
&gt; is to say, one that portrays a verisimilar ilk tuit.

MW: It won't (work out). Sooner or later we will find
someone who uses "kind" in some other special way.

My usual approach is to use a qualifier to distinguish 
different meanings. So here we might use "logical class"
and "general class" (or some such).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Union, the usual set theory definition.  The set whose 
&gt; members are
&gt; &gt; a member of one set, and or the other that you are making 
&gt; the union of.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Intersection, the set whose members are members of 
&gt; both sets that are
&gt; &gt; being intersected.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have time to provide a little exposition
&gt; &gt; &gt; on what you mean by the "derivation" dimension?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  a set/class whose membership can be defined in terms of
&gt; &gt; other sets and perhaps particular objects.  An easy example
&gt; &gt; is a class that is defined in terms of the intersection of
&gt; &gt; two other classes, e.g. red cars.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks In Prospect,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
