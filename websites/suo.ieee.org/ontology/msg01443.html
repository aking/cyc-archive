"John F. Sowa" &lt;sowa@bestweb.net&gt;:
&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Under what I understand the Whiteheadain process position (a form of
&gt; &gt;mereological extensionalism), when we apply the names 'statue' and 'clay' to
&gt;
&gt; &gt;a particular spatio-temporal extent - we say that this spatio-temporal
&gt; &gt;extent - this particular instance of a "recurring event type" - is both a
&gt; &gt;statue and clay. I happen to think this makes sense.

Statue = clay makes a kind of sense, in 3-d or 4-d; but it goes 
further than that. Imagine the clay being fired in the kiln, and then 
it is both statue and clay and firing; the thing is identical to the 
event. Many people find that much harder to swallow.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;NB - the example is not about the general terms 'clay' and 'statue' - but
&gt; &gt;about a particular clay statue.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, that is the point of view that Whitehead would take,
&gt;it is the point of view that Peirce would take, and it is
&gt;also the point of view that Aristotle would take.  I don't
&gt;know anybody, except perhaps Nicola, who would seriously
&gt;consider any other position.

I really doubt that Aristotle thought about 4-d, but others than 
Nicola would include at least Peter Simons and Barry Smith, to name 
two living colleagues. In fact I think that the endurantist view is 
much more common than the perdurantist one. It seems to be the line 
that people find most immediately compelling, probably since it fits 
very naturally with normal ways of talking. I recall causing a huge 
row on the PSL discussion group a few years ago by claiming that 
there was no real difference beteween a process and an object. (I 
used the example of a ripening tomato, and showed that it fitted the 
PSL process criteria, and was chastised for causing silly 
time-wasting debates, since it was just obvious to all normal people 
that a tomato was NOT a process.)

&gt; &gt;I am not sure how you saying you want people to take a Whiteheadian view
&gt; &gt;differs from Pat and Matthew saying they think people should have a '4-D'
&gt; &gt;view. in both cases, you leave the Endurantist view out in the cold. I agree
&gt;
&gt; &gt;this makes life simpler for you (and me), but it seems a bit hard on the
&gt; &gt;Endurantist.

You know, why don't we all just say, to hell with endurantists? They 
cause no end of trouble. We can run rings around them in any 
technical debate, and in any case they are mostly nerdy academics who 
will never make serious $$ in their entire pathetic scholarly lives, 
so who needs them? The IEEE doesn't even know the difference.
.....

&gt;Nobody has ever asked me to pass a "continuant".  They ask me
&gt;to pass "a statue".  And if I ask them, you mean this lump
&gt;of clay?  They would say "yes".

And if you then smash it, grind it under your foot, sweep it up and 
pass them the pile of clay, will they be happy? (Sorry, I couldn't 
resist asking.)

Pat

PS Another famous example, by the way, to illuminate the limitations 
of common sense, is to ask someone to take an empty, clean, cup; spit 
into it; then drink the liquid in the cup. People find the idea 
revolting: why?
