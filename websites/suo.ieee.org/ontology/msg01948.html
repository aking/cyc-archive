John, Mary,

Morning eyes tell me that a number of statements that I made --
sentences I wrote?  paragraphs I wrote?  @@@aaarrrggghhh!!!  --
of late up late are more likely to cause a blur than a sign
with any species of generativity in anybody's mind, so here
is my try at a restatement, a rewrite, a re-whatever.

Mary, I am including you in this because it was the question
that you asked about CP 4.549 that brought the neighboring
passage from CP 4.539 back into my mind.  Let me know if
you found the Lady Welby selections as I will have time
later today to copy them out if you cannot find them.

Obscurity 1

&gt; I would have to say that this propositional expression,
&gt; say, "e", denotes a function e : X -&gt; B, with the type
&gt; of e being left indefinite for the present moment, not
&gt; yet run time, nor even compile time, but only IOU time.
&gt; This semes to suggest that the type of the proposition
&gt; to be e-nunciated is a co-notation that e-fects itself
&gt; not in the mediate but only in the ultimate denotation.
&gt; I belive that Peirce would fairly call that a "symbol".

I am, as usual, back in the saddle of my favorite hobby horse,
pretty near in the "logical equine class" of an old saw horse,
to wit, the one that I illustrate here:

This means that I take a proposition-name like "g", that names a proposition,
and a proposition-expression like "((p(q))(q(s))((pq(rs))))", that expresses
a proposition, to be just so many species of signs that adumbrate, denote,
express, indicate, name, or whatever, a species of formal object that we
rangers and scouts may all of us call a "proposition", thus conforming
to the "way out here" way of speaking that got imposed on us by those
brutally civilizing folks who settled our accounts when the frontier
that we opened up came to be claimed as their own deepest interior.

By the way, I rather consistently, if just a bit doggedly,
view the proposition-graph of roughly the following shape,
that gets itself construed in dynamic data-structure form
when the above proposition-string gets parsed into memory,
as yet another brand of sign that denotes the proposition:

|    r o   o s     o rs
|      |   |       |
|    p o   o q     o pq
|       \ /        |
|        o---------o
|        |
|        |
|        @

It is, of course, far more efficient to carry out all
of the needed transformations on the pointer-structure
rather than on the text string, so it is convenient for
practical purposes to recognize the resulting parse-graphs,
much like the function of diagrams in mathematical thinking,
as a theoretically respectable species, family, clan of signs.

So, just the way I see things, and was able to teach a computer to do so,
a name like "g", an expression like "((p(q))(q(s))((pq(rs))))", and a graph
like the one shown above are all just as capable, given a suitable interpreter
to bring them to life, of being the signs of this sort of more or less abstract,
formal, ideal, logical, mathematical object that most folks these days insist on
calling a "proposition", but that we could always resort to calling a certain type
of function, if push(down) comes to shove(up).

So far, so good, but not so far, as yet,
into the heart of this primal obscurity.

In the bit that I said about "compile time, run time"
I was trying to be accommodating to your sense of things,
and find some way to make sense of a more refined partition
of what is, for me, the ultimate logical object domain, namely,
the two layer universe of discourse that consists of the points
of type B^k and the functions of type B^k -&gt; B, for suitable k,
that I usually signify as "(B^k, B^k-&gt;B)" or even just as "[B^k]".
In this context, I can recognize the fact that this type of typing
is near-maximally abstract, and so I was trying to interpret some
of what you said as a potential reference to the concrete typing
of point spaces and function spaces, say, in which one would be
sensibly justified in distinguishing among various applications
of the "Splendor" of the form "((p(q))(q(s))((pq(rs))))" to
different concrete domains, say, for example, like these:

1.  p = paitrick, q = quail,   r = rooster,   s = sandpiper.
2.  p = particle, q = quantum, r = radiation, s = static.
3.  p = person,   q = quorum,  r = rule,      s = standard.

Thus, the diverse universes of discourse that are severally
compacted under the ccommon name "[p, q, r, s]" each affords
its own distinctive application for the pre-eminent truth of
the abstract proposition of the from ((p(q))(q(s))((pq(rs)))).
Still, it semes to me that the most important thing to know
about this proposition is that it is always true in whatever
universe of discourse, and so the corresponding painting of
the cells is one that paints each cell indifferently, dare I
say "institutionally", the very same color.  But that is just
saying that ((p(q))(q(s))((pq(rs)))) = 1, where one is free to
read this 1 in any one of the following ways, among many others:

a.  1 : B.
b.  1 : B^4 -&gt; B.
b.  1 : {&lt;p, q, r, s&gt;} -&gt; B.

So what I meant by all of that, if I can either remember or make it up afresh,
is that the concrete type that gets associated with a particular application
of a theorem is one of those refined qualities that belongs to the domain of
application and not so much to the theorem itself.  Or something like that.

I was going to move on to the next obscurity,
but I need to take a vitamin before I do.

Out To Lunch,

Obscurity 2

&gt; | Imagine that one picks out a finite collection of one's
&gt; | favorite propositions for describing an object domain X.
&gt; | The propositions are optimally chosen to be "independent"
&gt; | of each other, that is, "orthogonal" in a logical sense,
&gt; | and are commonly dubbed as one's "basic propositions" or
&gt; | singled out by referring to them as "coordinate projections"
&gt; | of the form x&lt;j&gt; : X -&gt; B, for j = 1 to k.  I usually picture
&gt; | these as the k "circles" of a venn diagram for the universe X.
&gt; | If a given system of basic propositions is moderately adequate
&gt; | to the demands of describing, more or less approximately, every
&gt; | other region of a "relatively arbitrary" shape that one needs to
&gt; | cover in the universe X, then one finds it basically convenient
&gt; | to "factor" any "arbitrary" proposition f : X -&gt; B through the
&gt; | "cartesian power space" B^k, as in the following diagram:
&gt; |
&gt; |                          f
&gt; |                    X o------&gt;o B
&gt; |                       \     ^
&gt; |  c = &lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;k&gt;&gt; \   / f'
&gt; |                         v /
&gt; |                          o
&gt; |                         B^k
&gt; |
&gt; | This says that f(x)  =  f'(c(x))  =  f'(x&lt;1&gt;(x), ..., x&lt;k&gt;(x)), where
&gt; | c(x)  =  the "code" of x  =  the bit-list &lt;x&lt;1&gt;(x), ..., x&lt;n&gt;(x)&gt; in B^k
&gt; | is the binary coding of the element x in X, and where
&gt; | f' is the  "derived mapping" from codes to B.
&gt; |
&gt; | Given this sort of set-up, we can proceed to work with
&gt; | derived propositions f' : B^k -&gt; B, using truth tables
&gt; | or something equivalent.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the point, you ask?  Well, I think of the vertex X as being
&gt; the point where the otherwise pure logic gets applied, and this is
&gt; a species of referential meaning that can vary from application to
&gt; application, a "run time parameter", so to speak.  But the logical
&gt; functions themselves, enjoying types like f' : B^k -&gt; B,  I cannot
&gt; see any way to classify these with any more pretense of refinement
&gt; than to sort them into "logical equivalence classes" (LEC's) based
&gt; on, what else, logical equivalence.  And that puts all theorems in
&gt; the same pot, all absurdities in another, and all contingencies to
&gt; gather with birds of variegate and sundry like-continged feathers.

Obscurity 3

&gt; A truth value is just an element of B, treated as a logical value.
&gt; 
&gt; A propositional expression (a sign thing) is the expression of
&gt; a proposition (an abstract or formal object), which by itself
&gt; gets its abstract or formal meaning by being subject to the
&gt; classical laws of logic, or some other axiom system, but
&gt; since I am a concrete-minded person I constantly check
&gt; its putative properties against one or another simple
&gt; sorts of standard models, for example, functions of
&gt; concrete type X -&gt; B, or of abstract type B^k -&gt; B,
&gt; for a suitable X or k, or the corresponding shapes
&gt; of geometric regions in some universe of discourse
&gt; to whose detail within cells we remain indifferent.
&gt; In short, the sentence denotes a proposition that
&gt; can be interpreted as a function of type B^k -&gt; B,
&gt; but the rangey B at the end is not the B all end all,
&gt; and it is certainly not the denotation of the sentence.
