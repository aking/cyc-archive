Martin,
     .    Thanks for this further clarification.

     .    Further responses interspersed below, prefaced "GH&gt;     ".



     .    Incidentally, I should say that I agree absolutely with
Matthew's:
*    assumption of "naive realism"; and that
*    if (SUO-)KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it; but with the
rider that
*    SUO-KIF is progressively extended to accommodate such conceptual
areas.

MK&gt;&gt; If I remember correctly this was John Sowa's suggestion supported by
Matthew.  I support it too.

     .    This is how language necessarily developed, and is a common
sense approach to the task.

 &lt;&lt;Mac Word 3.0&gt;&gt;


Note from Graham Horn wrote with comments from Martin King inserted.
Martin, John, etc.,
.              This looks like solid progress.
MK&gt; Delighted you think so
.    The ideas of having "generic relationship concept" ("relationship
type"
in normal data modelling parlance), and "relationship instance" (just
"relationship" in normal data modelling parlance) make good sense, and fit
in well with the normal data modelling terminology many people use. It
does,
however, mean that the traditional "entity - relationship diagram (ERD)"
now
becomes an "entity - relationship type diagram".

MK&gt;  I believe the most natural interpretation of most ERD diagramming
conventions each graphic element coresponds with something at the type
level.  This a typical context in which this is so obvious, that nobody
bothers to qualify the word relationship (or the word entity) with the word
type.  So ERD always has meant "entity type - relationship type diagram",
but we did not bother to say so, and I suggest can still leave it implied
by
the context..

GH&gt;  I understand perfectly where you are coming from. However, It is
pretty well exactly this sort of assumed obviousness that led to this
thread. What we need to come up with for the SUO standard, as with any
international standard, is language that says EVERYTHING explicitly (or
refers the reader to another standard, or possibly other reference
document,
that does).

MK&gt;&gt; I agree a formal SUO must not use a term to mean two different things.
Therefore if we choose to define Relationship as an SUO term, we must
choose a particular meaning for it.  I would like this meaning to be "in
the real world".  In the Enterprise Ontology NL version, we actually wrote
sentences with the word Relationship which I interpret as statements about
relationship instances, but (by what I call sleight of hand), these
sentences by implication define the properties of the relationship type.
If I had the time at this moment, I would look up the KIF version of EO to
see what it looks like in that.

The whole point of a standard is that someone of normal
intelligence can read and understand and apply it reliably.

MK&gt;&gt; Yes, but most established ways of being as explicit as is necessary to
achieve formality actually make it much more difficult to read and
understand!

GH&gt;  This is why I asked for proposed wordings for these definitions
below, in my previous e-mail. I didn't want to propose them myself, as I am
not an expert on the logical language perspective, as your reply
demonstrates.

.    The third item looks to me like "the set of all instances of a
relationship having the nominated "generic relationship concept". I take it
this is what is proposed for "relation".
MK&gt; Yes and no.  Yes because it is at the population level.  No because the
most natural interpretation of Relation as used by Codd, Sowa, etc. is that
it refers to representation rather than the thing in the real world being
represented.  Matthew rightly identified that I had left this important
distinction out of my earlier note.  To make this as clear as possible I
have to use tables, and as these are likely to be distorted in message
text,
I attach them as a Word document.(See attached file: A domain of
discourse.doc)

GH&gt;  The concept that Jon Awbrey has made much of, of the triadic
relation(ship?) between object, mental concept of object, and symbol for
object, which seems to be what you are referring to here, makes a lot of
sense. It shouldn't be too difficult to get some simple description to
accommodate this.

MK&gt;&gt; I don't think what I have said is incompatible with this approach
(which I understand to come from Pierce and is support by John Sowa as well
as Jon).  I did not attempt to introduce the triadic concept for brevity,
and because I think the "naive realism" approach actually avoids having to
introduce it.

GH&gt;  I have looked at your tables below, and feel they need some
refinement and/or elaboration to give precise meaning. For example, in a
database like this one would normally have a table of customers,
representing the entity "customer", with information about them, such as
address, contact number, etc. One could have another table of suppliers,
representing the entity "supplier", similarly with information about them,
such as address, contact number, etc. Neither table necessarily contains
relationships. One would probably have a relationship of type (say)
"commerce" or "consumer complaint" between these two entities.

GH&gt;  If the relationship were "one-to-many", one would have one of the
columns present in both tables, so as to enable identification of which
supplier related to which customer. That column could list court case
reference numbers in a consumer claims tribunal.

GH&gt;  If the relationship were "many-to-many" , one would require a link
table containing at least one of the columns from each of the supplier and
customer tables, so as to enable identification in each row of which
supplier related to which customer. Other columns in this link table would
provide other information about the particular relationship between the
supplier and customer in each row. The link table may be (much) smaller or
(much) larger than either of the two tables joined by the relationship.

MK&gt;&gt;  Most of what you describe in these three paragraphs is exactly what I
do.  I don't believe where I would differ is germane to the present
discussion, so will leave it.

GH&gt;  When one takes this sort of situation into account, perhaps you can
see why the distinctions between "relationship" and "relation" are not
nearly so clear from what you have said so far. They aren't even true for
one-to-many relationships.

MK&gt;&gt;  Then I have to say some more to try to make it clearer.  The
distinction I was trying to make was to always use Relation to mean a
representation (of whatever) at the population level, and always to use
Relationship to mean a thing in the real world at the type or instance
level.  You may have correctly inferred that I may expect to be able to use
a Relation to represent the population of Relationships of a particular
type.  If you inferred that I expect every population of Relationships of a
particular type to be represented by a Relation that exists solely for that
purpose, or that I expect every Relation to represent a population of
Relationships of a particular type, I did not say or intend either.  In
fact, I expect:
1. sometimes to use a table (Relation) to represent the population of
Entities of a particular type.
2. sometimes to represent a population of Relationships of a particular
type (e.g. one-to-many) by a column in a table (Relation) representing the
population of a Entities of a particular type.
3. sometines to use a dedicated Relation to represent the population of a
Relationship of a particular type (e.g. "many-to-many").

MK&gt;&gt;  I hope this has described the distinction I make in more precise
detail.  I fear it has suffered from precisely the point I made several
paragraphs above, viz. that being more explicit risks ease of reading and
understanding!!!

GH&gt;  I suspect a lot of work will be needed to get such items in the
terminology defined in clear and unambiguous ways. Meanwhile, those of us
who don't have the background covering those meanings remain at a
significant disadvantage in trying to come to grips with key aspects of the
logic being valuably added to the SUO. It also makes it difficult for us to
explain the things we see as currently inadequate in it.

GH&gt;  Whatever the outcome, by the time the SUO gets to be a draft
standard, it would be highly preferable that any diagrammatic tables and/or
examples be also backed up by simple sentences with clear meanings
explaining the situation. The tables and/or examples should be back-up
material rather than the primary means of explication. I am certainly
prepared to provide suggestions for improving the clarity of proposals (or
else exemplifying the susceptibilities for misinterpretation by people with
different backgrounds).

MK&gt;&gt; I agree tables and examples probably have to be only back-up.  I fully
support aiming for the simplest possible sentences with clear meanings, but
fear the the simplest possible may be rather numerous and not very
simple!!!  In the meantime, I hope some tables and diagrams may help rather
than hinder.

.    If I am understanding this correctly, then the "generic relationship
concept" (or "relationship type") will be the same as the "generic relation
concept" (or "relation type"). Is this intended?
.    Can anyone:
*    come up with improved (clearer &amp; more succinct) wordings for the
definitions? and
*    provide examples with -arity = 1 and -arity &gt; 3?

.    I ask this because I believe we should have good solid simple and
unambiguous definitions that leave nothing to be puzzled over or guessed
at.
.    I would prefer that the SUO terminology is compatible with data
modelling paradigm as much as possible. I say this in view of the amount of
database development undertaken these days, using such ordinary "Office"
software products as MS Access and Lotus Approach, which most people have
on
their work and home computers.
.    This also seems appropriate to me since the SUO scope includes: "This
standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable computers to
utilize it for applications such as data interoperability, information
search and retrieval, .......".
.    The purpose is also heavily data centric, as can be seen below.



===========================================
Revised Scope as at 25 Nov '00 (Jim, are these the latest?):
This standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable computers to
utilize it for applications such as data interoperability, information
search and retrieval, automated inferencing, and natural language
processing. An ontology is similar to a dictionary or glossary, but with
greater detail and structure that enables computers to process its content.
An ontology consists of a set of concepts, axioms, and relationships that
describe a domain of interest. An upper ontology is limited to concepts
that
are meta-, generic, abstract and philosophical, and therefore are general
enough to address (at a high level) a broad range of domain areas. Concepts
specific to given domains will not be included; however, this standard will
provide a structure and a set of general concepts upon which domain
ontologies (e.g. medical, financial, engineering, etc.) could be
constructed.
Purpose: (Why the standard needs to be developed and who will benefit.)
A.   AUTOMATED REASONING: The standard will be suitable for automated
logical inference to support knowledge-based reasoning applications.
B.   INTER-OPERABILITY: The standard will provide a basis for achieving
Inter-Operability among various software and database applications.
1)   Application developers can define new data elements in terms of a
common ontology, and thereby gain some degree of interoperability with
other
conformant systems.
2)   Applications based on domain-specific ontologies that are compliant
with this standard will be able to interoperate (to some degree) by virtue
of the shared common terms and definitions.
3)   The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange format whereby
owners of existing applications will be able to map existing data elements
just once to a common ontology. This provides a degree of interoperability
with other applications whose representations conform to SUO.  This entails
the SUO being able to be mapped to more restricted forms such as XML,
database schema, or object oriented schema.
C: APPLICATION AREAS
1)   E-commerce applications from different domains that need to
interoperate at both the data and semantic levels.
2)   Educational applications in which students learn concepts and
relationships directly from, or expressed in terms of, a common ontology.
This will also enable a standard record of learning to be kept.
3)   Natural language understanding tasks in which a knowledge based
reasoning system uses the ontology to disambiguate among likely
interpretations of natural language statements.

A domain of discourse

The first table attempts to clarify six concepts respecting distinctions
between Representation and Real World and between type, instance and
population.

     Representation Real World
Type 1. The definition of a table including its columns and meaning    2.
The concept of customer
Instance  3. A row in a table 4. A particular customer of a
particular trader
Population     5. A table of rows and columns with values    6. A
population of customers of one or more traders



A table of terms for referring to the domain of discourse.  Each term in
the
table below, which is congruent with the one above, should be interpreted
as
referring to the content of the corresponding cell in the table above.


     1. ? 2. Relationship [type]
     3. Tuple  4. Relationship [instance]
     5. Relation    6. ?



I believe this use of Tuple and Relation is consistent with Ted Codd, John
Sowa, and John Velman.  I believe the use of relationship is consistent
with
natural language.

I would welcome suggestions for terms to replace the question marks, though
I cannot think of any strong candidates in spite of many years of
experience
of discussion of this issue.

The problem is the risk of confusion, when one of the terms is used to
refer
to either of the concepts with question marks.  In my experience this can
usually be avoided by rephrasing the statement to use other  terms so the
distinctions are respected.

Subject:  RE: SUO: RE: Re: More KIF-ified Ontology Content




I strongly support what John Sowa has to say here.
I will just add a reply to Matthew that in my mind my words describing the
three concepts were based on the naive realism assumption to refer to the
real world as far as is possible.  I can see how they can be interpreted as
referring to representations of the real world, but I recommend avoiding
this.  I would also point out that John Velman's response to my
contribution, although in some sense was a useful paraphrase of my words,
in
fact has moved strongly to referring to the representation rather than the
real world.  I show extracts of both below for comparison.
Bottom line (in NL at least, but I think SUO/KIF too)) is try to write as
if
it is the real world is the referent, even the way you have to write it is
predicated on a particular style of representation.  This may sound like a
"cop out", but for me it is more a "sleight of hand" that works.
Yours, Martin
MK words

&gt; 1. A generic relationship concept (e.g. Customer), sometimes
&gt; called relationship type
&gt;
&gt; 2. A specific instance of a relationship concept (e.g. Martin
&gt; King is a customer of Singapore Airlines)
&gt;
&gt; 3. A population of relationship instances (e.g. all customers
&gt; of Singapore Airlines), close to the concept of class
&gt;
JV words
A relation of arity n, n&gt;0,  is symbolized as predicate with n arguments.
The extension of a relation of arity 1 is the set of things in the domain
of
quantification for which the predicate is true.  The  extension of a
relation of arity n&gt;1 is the subset of the n-fold Cartesian product of the
domain of quantification for which the predicate is true.
A relationship is an instance of a relation.    E.g.,  married(X,Y)
describes a relation. married(Bill, Hillary) describes a relationship.

Subject:  RE: SUO: RE: Re: More KIF-ified Ontology Content





Matthew, Mike, et al.,
That is a very serious and very difficult question:
&gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we
&gt;call what it is in the real world that they refer to?

As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box of metaphysical
problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and realists can talk together
quite
happily as long as they use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can
also work together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and other
formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C, Java, etc.
But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they refer to in the
real world?" all hell breaks loose.
You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?  what is
reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?
Suggestion:
1.   These philosophical issues, despite their perennial interest, have
never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?) satisfaction.  Of one thing we
can be absolutely certain is that they will not be solved on this mailing
list.
2.   Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the purpose of
the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive realism" that says that the
world exists, and most of the words we use in ordinary language refer to
something, but let's not worry too much about what it is.
3.   For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt the
position that KIF is the official language to be used for everything that
can be officially expressed by the SUO.  If KIF can't express it, we don't
talk about it.

I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out" that
doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the same cop out
that
Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his Tractatus:  "Everything that
can be said can be said clearly, and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we
must be silent."
For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some extra
prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in the SUO] can be
said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot speak [in KIF], thereof we
must
be silent.
This is not an answer to the question of what do relations really refer to.
It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the only kind of cop out that will
allow us to get some work done.
John Sowa
