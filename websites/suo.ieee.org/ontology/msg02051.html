Dear Jon,

&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; | Extension.  (Latin 'ex' (= out) + 'tendere' (= to stretch).
&gt; |
&gt; | Physical space, considered as a single concrete continuum, as
&gt; | contrasted with the abstract conceptual space of mathematics.
&gt; | The distinction between extension and "space" in the abstract
&gt; | sense is clearly drawn by Descartes (1596-1650) in the
&gt; | 'Principles of Philosophy', Part 2, Principles 4-15.
&gt; |
&gt; | -- Ledger Wood, in Runes, page 105.
&gt; |
&gt; | One of the two attributes (q.v.) of God which, according to
&gt; | Spinoza, are accessible to the human intellect ('Ethica', 2).
&gt; | While the attribution of thought ('cogitatio', q.v.) to God
&gt; | was a medieval commonplace, the attribution of extension to
&gt; | God was, in the tradition, highly heretical.  Spinoza, however,
&gt; | was at great pains to show ('Ibid', 2, 14-18) that unless such
&gt; | attribution was made, all theories of God's causality were
&gt; | rendered either nonsensical or explicitly contradictory.
&gt; |
&gt; | -- William S. Weedon, in Runes, page 105.
&gt; |
&gt; | Extension.  See 'Intension and Extension'.  [Maybe Later.]

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want to put a label on me, then I think extensionalist
&gt; &gt; &gt; is probably your best bet. What I mean by this is taking as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; identity criteria for things, that any two things with the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; extension are the same thing. (It might be more proper to say
&gt; &gt; &gt; that there are not two (or more) things with the same extension).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The world then divides neatly into two basic sorts, sets
&gt; &gt; &gt; (including relations) and individuals (or particulars if
&gt; &gt; &gt; you prefer) where individuals are things that have an
&gt; &gt; &gt; extension in space time, and sets are things that
&gt; &gt; &gt; have members.
&gt; 
&gt; The terms "individual" and "particular" are not synonyms in 
&gt; classical logic.
&gt; A "particular" is that of which we can have enough 
&gt; information to say we know.
&gt; An "individual" is that of which we can only imagine having 
&gt; the power to grasp.

MW: Interesting. I can't say I had noticed that kind of 
precision here. Nor do I intend it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That rules out the empty set.  Also, I'm not sure it's wise 
&gt; to equivocate
&gt; &gt; on "extension" as you do:  the extension of an individual 
&gt; for you is (I take it)
&gt; &gt; something like a 4D chunk of space-time, while the 
&gt; extension of a set is the set
&gt; &gt; of its members (i.e., the set itself).  Granted, for you, 
&gt; both types of extension
&gt; &gt; are used to individuate objects of the relevant sort, but 
&gt; to avoid confusion perhaps
&gt; &gt; it's better to talk instead about, e.g., the 
&gt; spatio-temporal *extent* or *boundaries*
&gt; &gt; (or the like) of an individual, rather than its extension.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing to note about this position is that any piece of
&gt; &gt; &gt; space time is an individual, just as any collection of things
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a set.
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure exactly, but Matthew appears to be using the term "extension"
&gt; along the lines of a fairly established tradition, much in the manner
&gt; that Descates did, not that's its any recommendation to a Peircean,
&gt; but I think, on balance, that this is probably one of life's little
&gt; ambiguities and/or equivocations with which we are just plain stuck.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; To say this, you need to make sure that your underlying set theory
&gt; &gt; doesn't yield the existence of proper classes, which are collections
&gt; &gt; that are *not* sets.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; POSSIBLE WORLDS
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the key challenges for any viewpoint is how to model what
&gt; &gt; &gt; could be (past present and future), as well as what is/has been.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is done using a "possible worlds" approach, or more properly
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible universes, in which spatio-temporal parts can be shared
&gt; &gt; &gt; between different possible universes.  So my life up to today
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be part of any possible future I might have.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A consequence of this (I believe) is that modal logic
&gt; &gt; &gt; is not required.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's true -- one can express the usual semantics of modal 
&gt; languages
&gt; &gt; in a nonmodal language by quantifying directly over possible worlds
&gt; &gt; and possible individuals.
&gt; 
&gt; Something about a man, a plan, and green fan?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I am not) the key constructs in KIF are:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - constants
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - variables (and more generally lambda calculus)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Nope, there is no variety of lambda calculus in KIF.
&gt; &gt; (And I am puzzled why you think the lambda calculus
&gt; &gt; is a generalization of the notion of a variable.)
&gt; 
&gt; Lambda Calculus was devised to embody a rigorous theory for the
&gt; previously informal notions about variables as substitution sites
&gt; in expressions, that is, a theory of abstraction and application
&gt; of formulae.  

MW: My interprestation from this was that one way or another if you
had variables, you were using Lambda Calculus.

&gt; Any other formal theory of the same subject matter,
&gt; like Combinator Calculus, no matter what you may call it, will
&gt; have to deal with pretty much the same issues, consciously and
&gt; deliberately, or otherwise.  What else are variables for?
&gt; 
&gt; Have to break away --
&gt; 
&gt; Many Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - predication
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - relation
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - some basic elements of logic
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, this list (including the two elements above) sort of mooshes
&gt; &gt; together syntactic, semantic, and logical issues. The 
&gt; syntax, semantics,
&gt; &gt; and logic of KIF should be clearly expressed in the KIF 
&gt; spec forthcoming
&gt; &gt; Real Soon Now from the KIF working group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The question is how do you choose to use these.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The only thing that is certain is that if you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are not consistent you will store up trouble
&gt; &gt; &gt; for yourself.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not much content there that one couldn't deduce a priori!  :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The choices I make are:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - classes and individuals map to constants
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I.e., both classes (sets?) and individuals are
&gt; &gt; in the domain of quantification (and, I take it,
&gt; &gt; your quantification theory is first-order).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - predication is used for set membership.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You mean you model predication in terms of set membership
&gt; &gt; in the usual way?  Ok.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - how one individual stands to another is modelled by relation
&gt; &gt; &gt;    instances
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You mean you model one thing x standing in relation R to 
&gt; another thing y
&gt; &gt; by including the pair &lt;x,y&gt; in the set that represents (or, 
&gt; is identical
&gt; &gt; with) R (again, in the usual way)?  Ok.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;    note: only binary relations are used.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems bizarre to me to limit oneself in principle to 
&gt; binary relations.
&gt; &gt; Giving, for example, is a very natural 3-place relation.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;    This is principally to minimise structural constraints
&gt; &gt; &gt;    where all places in a relation must be filled,
&gt; &gt; &gt;    when some are not known.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This makes no sense to me whatever.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  - lambda calculus is used for defining constraints.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are two major varieties of lambda calculus -- typed 
&gt; and untyped --
&gt; &gt; and I don't see that either is needed, or even usable, for ontology.
&gt; &gt; The typed lambda calculus is basically just omega-order logic (i.e.,
&gt; &gt; roughly, there are in its intended semantics objects of every finite
&gt; &gt; order, and, in its language, variables that range over each order),
&gt; &gt; which takes us far beyond the expressiveness of first-order logic,
&gt; &gt; as well as the somewhat more expressive (proposed) extension of KIF
&gt; &gt; attained by the addition of row variables.  I had thought you wanted
&gt; &gt; to use a first-order framework.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The untyped lambda calculus (developed in by Church and 
&gt; Kleene in the 30s)
&gt; &gt; is an approach to computability theory (though, notably, 
&gt; has also been used
&gt; &gt; more recently in the semantics of natural language as the 
&gt; basis of a theory
&gt; &gt; of properties and relations).  The untyped calculus, while 
&gt; powerful and flexible,
&gt; &gt; is also mathematically very complex, and I haven't seen 
&gt; anything in ontology that
&gt; &gt; requires it.  Perhaps if you said what a "constraint" is.  
&gt; Are you simply talking
&gt; &gt; about the ability to define a class or relation by means of 
&gt; some condition like
&gt; &gt; "x is red and x is an apple"?  That only requires a 
&gt; reasonable class theory.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;     In general these indicate how a member of one class 
&gt; must stand in
&gt; &gt; &gt;     respect to a member of another class.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't see any connection between this statement and the 
&gt; lambda calculus.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; note:
&gt; &gt; &gt; relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are only 
&gt; allowed when the
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature of the constraint they define is defined by a 
&gt; lambda expression.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Relations don't define anything;  they are just (for you) 
&gt; sets of ordered pairs.
&gt; &gt; And it is looking more and more like a constraint is just a 
&gt; condition like the
&gt; &gt; one above.  I think you should leave "lambda" out of it!
&gt; &gt;
