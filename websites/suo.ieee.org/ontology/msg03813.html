Lest we get totally lost in the devilish details,
I think that it might be a good idea to remember
what I observed once before about the main theme
of this whole part of Peirce's discussion:

At this point in his discussion, Peirce is relating the nature of
inference, inquiry, and information to the character of the signs
that are invoked in support of the overall process in question,
a process that he is presently describing as &quot;symbolization&quot;.

The links among the types of signs -- icons, indices, symbols --
the aspects of semiosis -- connotation, denotation, information --
and the types of inference -- abduction, induction, deduction --
are parts of a bigger picture that we should try to keep in view.

Outline of Peirce's Examples:

1.a.  Disjunctive term &quot;man or horse or kangaroo or whale&quot;.

1.b.  Disjunctive term &quot;neat or swine or sheep or deer&quot;.

2.    Conjunctive term &quot;spherical bright fragrant juicy tropical fruit&quot;.

| Yet there are combinations of words and combinations of conceptions
| which are not strictly speaking symbols.  These are of two kinds
| of which I will give you instances.  We have first cases like:
|
| 'man and horse and kangaroo and whale',
|
| and secondly, cases like:
|
| 'spherical bright fragrant juicy tropical fruit'.
|
| (CSP, CE 1, 468-469).

Returning to our present examples, the unmentioned elements of the
universe of discourse X are the potential objects of !O!, and the
sign domain !S! will contain all of the terms that we want to put
on the sign relational Tables.  What are the interpretant signs?
Well, in public discursions we cannot literally cut and paste our
mental signs into texts, so we are stuck with using the same sorts
of signs that we ordinarily assign to the sign domain !S! as proxies
for these concepts, or &quot;mental symbols&quot;, and so this surrogation will
constitute the customary practice in formal, public discussions.  But
the nice thing about the &quot;formal&quot; point of view, in other words, the
outlook that looks out for the forms of things above all, is that we
can be relatively sure that there is an approximate isomorph of the
one-foot-in-the-psyche sort of sign relation that can found among
the wholly unsubsidiary public domains.  So nothing much is lost,
formally speaking, if we forget about the possible distincture
in essence between a sign in the mind and a sign on the wall.

Given that we are now working with sign relations
of the form L c !O!x!S!x!I! = !O!x!S!x!S!, that is,
where the !S! = !I! is the common syntactic domain,
we can picture the situation in the following frame:

|                             |   &quot;horse&quot;                   |
|                             |   &quot;kangaroo&quot;                |
|                             |   &quot;whale&quot;                   |

That is to say, in the beginning there is nothing but words,
and the objective side of the universe is all form and void.

JD: So now, we are ready to restate and comment on
    some Peirce excerpts you mentioned in your mails.

Example 1.a.  &quot;man or horse or kangaroo or whale&quot;.

| The first of these terms has no comprehension which is
| adequate to the limitation of the extension.  In fact,
| men, horses, kangaroos, and whales have no attributes
| in common which are not possessed by the entire class
| of mammals.  For this reason, this disjunctive term,
| 'man and horse and kangaroo and whale', is of no use
| whatever.  For suppose it is the subject of a sentence;
| suppose we know that men and horses and kangaroos and
| whales have some common character.  Since they have no
| common character which does not belong to the whole class
| of mammals, it is plain that 'mammals' may be substituted
| for this term.  Suppose it is the predicate of a sentence,
| and that we know that something is either a man or a horse
| or a kangaroo or a whale;  then, the person who has found
| out this, knows more about this thing than that it is a
| mammal;  he therefore knows which of these four it is for
| these four have nothing in common except what belongs to
| all other mammals.  Hence in this case the particular
| one may be substituted for the disjunctive term.
| A disjunctive term, then, -- one which aggregates
| the extension of several symbols, -- may always be
| replaced by a simple term.  (CSP, CE 1, 468-469).

Suppose that one &quot;attribute in common&quot; or &quot;common character&quot;
that comes to mind for men, horses, kangaroos, and whales
is the descriptor &quot;sucks when young&quot; (SWY).  Then we have
the following beginnings of a sign relational set-up:

Syntactic domain, !S!  =  {s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4, u, v, w}.

s_1  =  &quot;man&quot;
s_2  =  &quot;horse&quot;
s_3  =  &quot;kangaroo&quot;
s_4  =  &quot;whale&quot;

u    =  &quot;man or horse or kangaroo or whale&quot;
v    =  &quot;sucks when young&quot;
w    =  &quot;mammal&quot;

Still nothing happening on the objective side of the world.
Our first inkling of a connection to the &quot;world of matter&quot;
comes with the notions of denotation and Peirce's &quot;sphere&quot;.

| It is important to distinguish between the two functions of a word:
| 1st to denote something -- to stand for something, and 2nd to mean
| something -- or as Mr. Mill phrases it -- to 'connote' something.
|
| What it denotes is called its 'Sphere'.
| What it connotes is called its 'Content'.
| Thus the 'sphere' of the word 'man' is for
| me every man I know;  and for each of you it
| is every man you know.  The 'content' of 'man'
| is all that we know of all men, as being two-
| legged, having souls, having language, &amp;c., &amp;c.
| It is plain that both the 'sphere' and the
| 'content' admit of more and less.  ...
|
| Now the sphere considered as a quantity is called the Extension;
| and the content considered as quantity is called the Comprehension.
| Extension and Comprehension are also termed Breadth and Depth.  So that
| a wider term is one which has a greater extension;  a narrower one is
| one which has a less extension.  A higher term is one which has a
| less Comprehension and a lower one has more.
|
| The narrower term is said to be contained under the wider one;
| and the higher term to be contained in the lower one.
|
| We have then:
|
| o-----------------------------o-----------------------------o
| |                             |                             |
| |  What is 'denoted'          |  What is 'connoted'         |
| |                             |                             |
| |  Sphere                     |  Content                    |
| |                             |                             |
| |  Extension                  |  Comprehension              |
| |                             |                             |
| |           ( wider           |         ( lower             |
| |  Breadth  &lt;                 |  Depth  &lt;                   |
| |           ( narrower        |         ( higher            |
| |                             |                             |
| |  What is contained 'under'  |  What is contained 'in'     |
| |                             |                             |
| o-----------------------------o-----------------------------o
|
| The principle of explicatory or deductive reasoning then is that:
|
| Every part of a word's Content belongs to
| every part of its Sphere,
|
| or:
|
| Whatever is contained 'in' a word belongs to
| whatever is contained under it.

Okay, that assembles the pieces of the puzzle that I wanted to examine,
but right at this moment in time I think I need a nap to clear my head.
