SUO SIG:

My reasons for carrying out -- in rather excruciating detail! --
that redaction of a "stilted" (Space&amp;Time Ltd) or "truncated"
Turing Machine (that computes the parity mapping p : B* -&gt; B)
into what I call the "Reflective Extension of Logical Graphs" --
that is to say, Peirce's Alpha Graphs for propositional logic --
or "RefLog", for short, was only to try to impress on you the
fact that this particular syntax for propositional expression
is efficient enough to represent a rather complex proposition
in a relatively compact form, moreover, in a style whose next
stage of parsing into graph-theoretic data structures affords
a species of representations in computer memory that is quite
easy to process, to store, and to transform in all of the due
ways that one needs to do with it.

That is the part of this project that I know fairly well.
You might just find -- if you try some time? -- that the
need to represent, as efficiently as possible, the types
of logical situations that we commonly call "partitions",
or "logical equivalence classes" (LEC's), is rather rife
throughout the realms over which our ontological studies
range, and therefor I am so bold as to believe that this
form of expression, along with its associated algorithms,
all of which I labored to implement during the otherwise
dull-as-disco decade of the 1980's, might just be of use
for the sake of the present enterprise.  And when I note
that some folks are writing out the sorts of expressions
for partitions that I initially tried and then abandoned
more than twenty years ago, and that they appear to have
no awareness of what it means that the number of clauses
needed to represent a partition among k logical features
is growing like O(k^2), which is no relation to being Ok,
well, I just want to exclaim that "All Is Vanity!" and I
even beguine to wish that I had not missed out on all of
that dancin'.

Oh well, the past is prolog --
Capitalize on it how ye may.

I will now begin to trot out a number of steps
that are far more gingerly and dodgy in nature.
Most likely, or not, I will need to back-track
from time to time and maybe even between times.
There is no other way to do it, but to beguine.

So let this rumba begin!
Bonfire after the dance!

This is the edge of what I know, at least, it is
one of the edges, a place where everything appears
sharper and clearer, and yet just beyond which it all
becomes just a half-bit too hazy and tantalizing to bear.
It is for me another one of those personal boundaries where
the finite that I am comes to meet the infinite that I am not.
And in this meeting I find that the Fables and Parables of Turing
are especially apt to be instructive about the nature of the juncture.

I have already invited you to help me to shape this edge --
I believe that it would have some utility for all of us! --
and I will not withdraw it just because I run into one
or two or three or a finite number who would prefer
to abrade, or to blunt, or to dent, or to dull it.

You are probably wondering,
if you are one who wonders:

Where Is This Differential?

And that is what I will try to transmit,
the bit that I currently have in my wit,
or at any rate, the one that I can find
or invent any fashion or method for its
proportionate sharing, in the hope that
another one or two or three or a finite
number may have the residual bits of it.

I have alluded to the Alpha Level of Peirce's Logical Graphs,
which, for the sake of a brief life, I think that I will now
dub "PerLog".  The reason that I cannot, with total accuracy,
subsume this under the names of "Conceptual Graphs", or even
"Existental Graphs" is that Peirce's actual system of formal
graphical structures is so abstract that the interpretations
in logic for all of its basic structures, except for the one
fixed point of negation, that is, "(X)" mapping into "Not X",
are not yet determined in the ways that we would customarily
expect when we decrypt them as "Entitative" or "Existential".

There are several extensions of PerLog that I have developed,
merely by applying to their form of construction a conjoined
couple of "Esthetic Injunctions" that I distilled, condensed,
and refined from out of the whole body of Peirce's full work.

These founding principles, or "Esthetic Imperatives", pervading Peirce's
logical work, and perhaps present throughout his entire philosophy, are:

1.  Try to reduce the number of primitive notions.
2.  Try to vary what has been held to be constant.

I used to imagine that I had extracted yet a third devoir,
but it slipped from my mind one morning, on the threshold
of a dream, and has never returned to my waking awareness,
though I suspect that it's bearing is kin to the devotion
that we Peirceans call the "Pragmatic Maxim" (PM), and so
perhaps it shall come back to me as I near to the Evening.

Until Later,

Jon Awbrey
