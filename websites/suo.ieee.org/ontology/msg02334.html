| Then he kicked the log to pieces.  There he found
| the chipmunk and flattened him out, and there, too,
| to his horror his discovered his penis all gnawed up.
| "Oh, my, of what a wonderful organ he has deprived me!
| But why do I speak thus?  I will make objects out of the
| pieces for human beings to use."  Then he took the end of
| his penis, the part that has no foreskin, and declared,
| "This is what human beings will call the lily-of-the-lake."
| This he threw in a lake near by.  Then he took the other
| pieces declaring in turn:  "This the people will call
| potatoes;  this the people will call turnips;  this the
| people will call artichokes;  this the people will call
| ground-beans;  this the people will call dog-teeth;
| this the people will call sharp-claws;  this the
| people will call rice."  All these pieces he threw
| into the water.  Finally he took the end of his
| penis and declared, "This the people will call
| the pond-lily."  He was referring to the square
| part of the end of his penis.
|
| What was left of his penis was not very long.
| When, at last, he started off again, he left
| behind him the box in which he had until then
| kept his penis coiled up.
|
| And this is the reason our penis has its present shape.
| It is because of these happenings that the penis is short.
| Had the chipmunk not gnawed off Trickster's penis our penis
| would have the appearance that Trickster's had first had.
| It was so large that he had to carry it on his back.
| Now it would not have been good had our penis
| remained like that and the chipmunk was
| created for the precise purpose of
| performing this particular act.
| Thus it is said.
