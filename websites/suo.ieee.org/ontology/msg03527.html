1.3.10.10  The Cactus Language:  Stylistics

| As a result, we can hardly conceive of how many possibilities there are
| for what we call objective reality.  Our sharp quills of knowledge are so
| narrow and so concentrated in particular directions that with science there
| are myriads of totally different real worlds, each one accessible from the
| next simply by slight alterations -- shifts of gaze -- of every particular
| discipline and subspecialty.

This Subsection highlights an issue of &quot;style&quot; that arises in describing
a formal language.  In broad terms, I use the word &quot;style&quot; to refer to a
loosely specified class of formal systems, typically ones that have a set
of distinctive features in common.  For instance, a style of proof system
usually dictates one or more rules of inference that are acknowledged as
conforming to that style.  In the present context, the word &quot;style&quot; is a
natural choice to characterize the varieties of formal grammars, or any
other sorts of formal systems that can be contemplated for deriving the
sentences of a formal language.

In looking at what seems like an incidental issue, the discussion arrives
at a critical point.  The question is:  What decides the issue of style?
Taking a given language as the object of discussion, what factors enter
into and determine the choice of a style for its presentation, that is,
a particular way of arranging and selecting the materials that come to
be involved in a description, a grammar, or a theory of the language?
To what degree is the determination accidental, empirical, pragmatic,
rhetorical, or stylistic, and to what extent is the choice essential,
logical, and necessary?  For that matter, what determines the order
of signs in a word, a sentence, a text, or a discussion?  All of
the corresponding parallel questions about the character of this
choice can be posed with regard to the constituent part as well
as with regard to the main constitution of the formal language.

In order to answer this sort of question, at any level of articulation,
one has to inquire into the type of distinction that it invokes, between
arrangements and orders that are essential, logical, and necessary and
orders and arrangements that are accidental, rhetorical, and stylistic.
As a rough guide to its comprehension, a &quot;logical order&quot;, if it resides
in the subject at all, can be approached by considering all of the ways
of saying the same things, in all of the languages that are capable of
saying roughly the same things about that subject.  Of course, the &quot;all&quot;
that appears in this rule of thumb has to be interpreted as a fittingly
qualified sort of universal.  For all practical purposes, it simply means
&quot;all of the ways that a person can think of&quot; and &quot;all of the languages
that a person can conceive of&quot;, with all things being relative to the
particular moment of investigation.  For all of these reasons, the rule
must stand as little more than a rough idea of how to approach its object.

If it is demonstrated that a given formal language can be presented in
any one of several styles of formal grammar, then the choice of a format
is accidental, optional, and stylistic to the very extent that it is free.
But if it can be shown that a particular language cannot be successfully
presented in a particular style of grammar, then the issue of style is
no longer free and rhetorical, but becomes to that very degree essential,
necessary, and obligatory, in other words, a question of the objective
logical order that can be found to reside in the object language.

As a rough illustration of the difference between logical and rhetorical
orders, consider the kinds of order that are expressed and exhibited in
the following conjunction of implications:

&quot;X =&gt; Y  and  Y =&gt; Z&quot;.

Here, there is a happy conformity between the logical content and the
rhetorical form, indeed, to such a degree that one hardly notices the
difference between them.  The rhetorical form is given by the order
of sentences in the two implications and the order of implications
in the conjunction.  The logical content is given by the order of
 propositions in the extended implicational sequence:

X  =&lt;  Y  =&lt;  Z.

To see the difference between form and content, or manner and matter,
it is enough to observe a few of the ways that the expression can be
varied without changing its meaning, for example:

&quot;Z &lt;= Y  and  Y &lt;= X&quot;.

Any style of declarative programming, also called &quot;logic programming&quot;,
depends on a capacity, as embodied in a programming language or other
formal system, to describe the relation between problems and solutions
in logical terms.  A recurring problem in building this capacity is in
bridging the gap between ostensibly non-logical orders and the logical
orders that are used to describe and to represent them.  For instance,
to mention just a couple of the most pressing cases, and the ones that
are currently proving to be the most resistant to a complete analysis,
one has the orders of dynamic evolution and rhetorical transition that
manifest themselves in the process of inquiry and in the communication
of its results.

This patch of the ongoing discussion is concerned with describing a
particular variety of formal languages, whose typical representative
is the painted cactus language !L! = !C!(!P!).  It is the intention of
this work to interpret this language for propositional logic, and thus
to use it as a sentential calculus, an order of reasoning that forms an
active ingredient and a significant component of all logical reasoning.
To describe this language, the standard devices of formal grammars and
formal language theory are more than adequate, but this only raises the
next question:  What sorts of devices are exactly adequate, and fit the
task to a &quot;T&quot;?  The ultimate desire is to turn the tables on the order
of description, and so begins a process of eversion that evolves to the
point of asking:  To what extent can the language capture the essential
features and laws of its own grammar and describe the active principles
of its own generation?  In other words:  How well can the language be
described by using the language itself to do so?

In order to speak to these questions, I have to express what a grammar says
about a language in terms of what a language can say on its own.  In effect,
it is necessary to analyze the kinds of meaningful statements that grammars
are capable of making about languages in general and to relate them to the
kinds of meaningful statements that the syntactic &quot;sentences&quot; of the cactus
language might be interpreted as making about the very same topics.  So far
in the present discussion, the sentences of the cactus language do not make
any meaningful statements at all, much less any meaningful statements about
languages and their constitutions.  As of yet, these sentences subsist in the
form of purely abstract, formal, and uninterpreted combinatorial constructions.

Before the capacity of a language to describe itself can be evaluated,
the missing link to meaning has to be supplied for each of its strings.
This calls for a dimension of semantics and a notion of interpretation,
topics that are taken up for the case of the cactus language !C!(!P!)
in Subsection 1.3.10.12.  Once a plausible semantics is prescribed for
this language it will be possible to return to these questions and to
address them in a meaningful way.

The prominent issue at this point is the distinct placements of formal
languages and formal grammars with respect to the question of meaning.
The sentences of a formal language are merely the abstract strings of
abstract signs that happen to belong to a certain set.  They do not by
themselves make any meaningful statements at all, not without mounting
a separate effort of interpretation, but the rules of a formal grammar
make meaningful statements about a formal language, to the extent that
they say what strings belong to it and what strings do not.  Thus, the
formal grammar, a formalism that appears to be even more skeletal than
the formal language, still has bits and pieces of meaning attached to it.
In a sense, the question of meaning is factored into two parts, structure
and value, leaving the aspect of value reduced in complexity and subtlety
to the simple question of belonging.  Whether this single bit of meaningful
value is enough to encompass all of the dimensions of meaning that we require,
and whether it can be compounded to cover the complexity that actually exists
in the realm of meaning -- these are questions for an extended future inquiry.
