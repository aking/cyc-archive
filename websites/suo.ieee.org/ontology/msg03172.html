I continue with my consideration of Peirce's theory of information.
For convenience of reference and review, I repeat here the earlier
material on his notion of determination, which is key to unlocking
everything from the definition of a sign relation to his teachings
about the integral relationships among inference, information, and
inquiry itself.

| Now that I have proved sufficiently that everything
| comes to pass according to determinate reasons, there
| cannot be any more difficulty over these principles
| of God's foreknowledge.  Although these determinations
| do not compel, they cannot but be certain, and they
| foreshadow what shall happen.
|
| It is true that God sees all at once the whole sequence
| of this universe, when he chooses it, and that thus he
| has no need of the connexion of effects and causes in
| order to foresee these effects.  But since his wisdom
| causes him to choose a sequence in perfect connexion,
| he cannot but see one part of the sequence in the other.
| 
| It is one of the rules of my system of general harmony,
| 'that the present is big with the future', and that he
| who sees all sees in that which is that which shall be.
|
| What is more, I have proved conclusively that God sees in
| each portion of the universe the whole universe, owing to
| the perfect connexion of things.  He is infinitely more
| discerning than Pythagoras, who judged the height of
| Hercules by the size of his footprint.  There must
| therefore be no doubt that effects follow their
| causes determinately, in spite of contingency
| and even of freedom, which nevertheless exist
| together with certainty or determination.

| Earlier this century in 'The Open Universe: An Argument for Indeterminism',
| Karl Popper wrote, &quot;Common sense inclines, on the one hand, to assert that
| every event is caused by some preceding events, so that every event can be
| explained or predicted. ...  On the other hand, ... common sense attributes
| to mature and sane human persons ... the ability to choose freely between
| alternative possibilities of acting.&quot;  This &quot;dilemma of determinism&quot;, as
| William James called it, is closely related to the meaning of time.  Is the
| future given, or is it under perpetual construction?  A profound dilemma for
| all of mankind, as time is the fundamental dimension of our existence.

| Of triadic Being the multitude of forms
| is so terrific that I have usually shrunk
| from the task of enumerating them;  and for
| the present purpose such an enumeration would
| be worse than superfluous:  it would be a great
| inconvenience.  In another paper, I intend to
| give the formal definition of a sign, which I
| have worked out by arduous and long labour.
| I will omit the explanation of it here.
| Suffice it to say that a sign endeavors
| to represent, in part at least, an Object,
| which is therefore in a sense the cause, or
| determinant, of the sign even if the sign
| represents its object falsely.  But to say
| that it represents its Object implies that
| it affects a mind, and so affects it as,
| in some respect, to determine in that mind
| something that is mediately due to the Object.
| That determination of which the immediate cause,
| or determinant, is the Sign, and of which the
| mediate cause is the Object may be termed the
| 'Interpretant' ...

| That whatever action is brute, unintelligent, and unconcerned
| with the result of it is purely dyadic is either demonstrable
| or is too evident to be demonstrable.  But in case that dyadic
| action is merely a member of a triadic action, then so far from
| its furnishing the least shade of presumption that all the action
| in the physical universe is dyadic, on the contrary, the entire and
| triadic action justifies a guess that there may be other and more marked
| examples in the universe of the triadic pattern.  No sooner is the guess
| made than instances swarm upon us amply verifying it, and refuting the
| agnostic position;  while others present new problems for our study.
| With the refutation of agnosticism, the agnostic is shown to be
| a superficial neophyte in philosophy, entitled at most to
| an occasional audience on special points, yet infinitely
| more respectable than those who seek to bolster up what
| is really true by sophistical arguments -- the traitors
| to truth that they are ...

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| Accurate writers have apparently made a distinction
| between the 'definite' and the 'determinate'.  A subject
| is 'determinate' in respect to any character which inheres
| in it or is (universally and affirmatively) predicated of
| it, as well as in respect to the negative of such character,
| these being the very same respect.  In all other respects it
| is 'indeterminate'.  The 'definite' shall be defined presently.
|
| A sign (under which designation I place every kind of thought,
| and not alone external signs), that is in any respect objectively
| indeterminate (i.e., whose object is undetermined by the sign itself)
| is objectively 'general' in so far as it extends to the interpreter
| the privilege of carrying its determination further.  'Example':
| &quot;Man is mortal.&quot;  To the question, What man? the reply is that the
| proposition explicitly leaves it to you to apply its assertion to
| what man or men you will.
|
| A sign that is objectively indeterminate in any respect
| is objectively 'vague' in so far as it reserves further
| determination to be made in some other conceivable sign,
| or at least does not appoint the interpreter as its deputy
| in this office.  'Example':  &quot;A man whom I could mention seems
| to be a little conceited.&quot;  The 'suggestion' here is that the
| man in view is the person addressed;  but the utterer does not
| authorize such an interpretation or 'any' other application of
| what she says.  She can still say, if she likes, that she does
| 'not' mean the person addressed.  Every utterance naturally
| leaves the right of further exposition in the utterer;  and
| therefore, in so far as a sign is indeterminate, it is vague,
| unless it is expressly or by a well-understood convention
| rendered general.
|
| Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 5.447

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Note 6

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| Perhaps a more scientific pair of definitions would be
| that anything is 'general' in so far as the principle of
| the excluded middle does not apply to it and is 'vague'
| in so far as the principle of contradiction does not
| apply to it.
|
| Thus, although it is true that &quot;Any proposition
| you please, 'once you have determined its identity',
| is either true or false&quot;;  yet 'so long as it remains
| indeterminate and so without identity', it need neither
| be true that any proposition you please is true, nor that
| any proposition you please is false.
|
| So likewise, while it is false that &quot;A proposition 'whose
| identity I have determined' is both true and false&quot;, yet
| until it is determinate, it may be true that a proposition
| is true and that a proposition is false.

Note 7

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| These remarks require supplementation.  Determination, in general, is not
| defined at all;  and the attempt at defining the determination of a subject
| with respect to a character only covers (or seems only to cover) explicit
| propositional determination.  The incidental remark [5.447] to the effect
| that words whose meaning should be determinate would leave &quot;no latitude of
| interpretation&quot; is more satisfactory, since the context makes it plain that
| there must be no such latitude either for the interpreter or for the utterer.
| The explicitness of the words would leave the utterer no room for explanation
| of his meaning.  This definition has the advantage of being applicable to a
| command, to a purpose, to a medieval substantial form;  in short to anything
| capable of indeterminacy.  (That everything indeterminate is of the nature
| of a sign can be proved inductively by imagining and analyzing instances of
| the surdest description.  Thus, the indetermination of an event which should
| happen by pure chance without cause, 'sua sponte', as the Romans mythologically
| said, 'spontanément' in French (as if what was done of one's own motion were sure
| to be irrational), does not belong to the event -- say, an explosion -- 'per se',
| or as an explosion.  Neither is it by virtue of any real relation:  it is by
| virtue of a relation of reason.  Now what is true by virtue of a relation of
| reason is representative, that is, is of the nature of a sign.  A similar
| consideration applies to the indiscriminate shots and blows of a Kentucky
| free fight.)  Even a future event can only be determinate in so far as it
| is a consequent.  Now the concept of a consequent is a logical concept.
| It is derived from the concept of the conclusion of an argument.  But an
| argument is a sign of the truth of its conclusion;  its conclusion is the
| rational 'interpretation' of the sign.  This is in the spirit of the Kantian
| doctrine that metaphysical concepts are logical concepts applied somewhat
| differently from their logical application.  The difference, however, is
| not really as great as Kant represents it to be, and as he was obliged to
| represent it to be, owing to his mistaking the logical and metaphysical
| correspondents in almost every case.

Note 8

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| Another advantage of this definition is that it saves us
| from the blunder of thinking that a sign is indeterminate
| simply because there is much to which it makes no reference;
| that, for example, to say, &quot;C.S. Peirce wrote this article&quot;,
| is indeterminate because it does not say what the color of
| the ink used was, who made the ink, how old the father of
| the ink-maker when his son was born, nor what the aspect
| of the planets was when that father was born.  By making
| the definition turn upon the interpretation, all that is
| cut off.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| At the same time, it is tolerably evident that the definition,
| as it stands, is not sufficiently explicit, and further, that
| at the present stage of our inquiry cannot be made altogether
| satisfactory.  For what is the interpretation alluded to?
| To answer that convincingly would be either to establish
| or to refute the doctrine of pragmaticism.
|
| Still some explanations may be made.  Every sign has a single object,
| though this single object may be a single set or a single continuum
| of objects.  No general description can identify an object.  But the
| common sense of the interpreter of the sign will assure him that the
| object must be one of a limited collection of objects.  [Long example].
|
| [And so] the latitude of interpretation which constitutes the
| indeterminacy of a sign must be understood as a latitude which
| might affect the achievement of a purpose.  For two signs whose
| meanings are for all possible purposes equivalent are absolutely
| equivalent.  This, to be sure, is rank pragmaticism;  for a purpose
| is an affection of action.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| The October remarks [i.e. those in the above paper] made the
| proper distinction between the two kinds of indeterminacy, viz.:
| indefiniteness and generality, of which the former consists in
| the sign's not sufficiently expressing itself to allow of an
| indubitable determinate interpretation, while the [latter]
| turns over to the interpreter the right to complete the
| determination as he please.
|
| It seems a strange thing, when one comes to ponder over it, that a sign
| should leave its interpreter to supply a part of its meaning;  but the
| explanation of the phenomenon lies in the fact that the entire universe --
| not merely the universe of existents, but all that wider universe,
| embracing the universe of existents as a part, the universe which
| we are all accustomed to refer to as &quot;the truth&quot; -- that all this
| universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively
| of signs.  Let us note this in passing as having a bearing upon the
| question of pragmaticism.
|
| The October remarks, with a view to brevity, omitted to mention that
| both indefiniteness and generality might primarily affect either the
| logical breadth or the logical depth of the sign to which it belongs.
| It now becomes pertinent to notice this.  When we speak of the depth,
| or signification, of a sign we are resorting to hypostatic abstraction,
| that process whereby we regard a thought as a thing, make an interpretant
| sign the object of a sign.  It has been a butt of ridicule since Molière's
| dying week, and the depth of a writer on philosophy can conveniently be
| sounded by his disposition to make fun of the basis of voluntary inhibition,
| which is the chief characteristic of mankind.  For cautious thinkers will
| not be in haste to deride a kind of thinking that is evidently founded
| upon observation -- namely, upon observation of a sign.  At any rate,
| whenever we speak of a predicate we are representing a thought as
| a thing, as a 'substantia', since the concepts of 'substance' and
| 'subject' are one, its concomitants only being different in the two
| cases.  It is needful to remark this in the present connexion, because,
| were it not for hypostatic abstraction, there could be no generality of
| a predicate, since a sign which should make its interpreter its deputy to
| determine its signification at his pleasure would not signify anything,
| unless 'nothing' be its significate.
|
| Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 5.448, note 1

Note 11

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| Concepts, or terms, are, in logic, conceived to have
| 'subjective parts', being the narrower terms into which
| they are divisible, and 'definitive parts', which are the
| higher terms of which their definitions or descriptions are
| composed:  these relationships constitute &quot;quantity&quot;.
|
| This double way of regarding a class-term as a whole of parts
| is remarked by Aristotle in several places (e.g., 'Metaphysics',
| D. xxv. 1023 b22).  It was familiar to logicians of every age.
| ... and it really seems to have been Kant who made these ideas
| pervade logic and who first expressly called them quantities.
| But the idea was old.  Archbishop Thomson, W.D. Wilson, and
| C.S. Peirce endeavor to make out a third quantity of terms.
| The last calls his third quantity &quot;information&quot;, and defines
| it as the &quot;sum of synthetical propositions in which the symbol
| is subject or predicate&quot;, antecedent or consequent.  The word
| &quot;symbol&quot; is here employed because this logician regards the
| quantities as belonging to propositions and to arguments,
| as well as to terms.
|
| A distinction of 'extensive' and 'comprehensive distinctness' is
| due to Scotus ('Opus Oxon.', I. ii. 3):  namely, the usual effect
| upon a term of an increase of information will be either to increase
| its breadth without without diminishing its depth, or to increase its
| depth without diminishing its breadth.  But the effect may be to show
| that the subjects to which the term was already known to be applicable
| include the entire breadth of another another term which had not been
| known to be so included.  In that case, the first term has gained in
| 'extensive distinctness'.  Or the effect may be to teach that the
| marks already known to be predicable of the term include the
| entire depth of another term not previously known to be so
| included, thus increasing the 'comprehensive distinctness'
| of the former term.
|
| The passage of thought from a broader to a narrower concept
| without change of information, and consequently with increase
| of depth, is called 'descent';  the reverse passage, 'ascent'.
|
| For various purposes, we often imagine our information to be less than
| it is.  When this has the effect of diminishing the breadth of a term
| without increasing its depth, the change is called 'restriction';
| just as when, by an increase of real information, a term gains
| breadth without losing depth, it is said to gain extension.
| This is, for example, a common effect of 'induction'.
| In such case, the effect is called generalization.
|
| A decrease of supposed information may have the effect
| of diminishing the depth of a term without increasing its
| information.  This is often called 'abstraction';  but it is
| far better to call it 'prescission';  for the word 'abstraction'
| is wanted as the designation of an even far more important procedure,
| whereby a transitive element of thought is made substantive, as in the
| grammatical change of an adjective into an abstract noun.  This may be
| called the principal engine of mathematical thought.
|
| When an increase of real information has the effect of increasing the
| depth of a term without diminishing the breadth, the proper word for the
| process is 'amplification'.  In ordinary language, we are inaccurately said
| to 'specify', instead of to 'amplify', when we add to information in this way.
| The logical operation of forming a hypothesis often has this effect, which may,
| in such case, be called 'supposition'.  Almost any increase of depth may be called
| 'determination'.

| Determine.
|
| The 'termination' is an ending, and a 'term' is
| a period (that comes to an end).  'Terminal' was
| first (and still may be) an adjective;  The Latin
| noun 'terminus' has come directly into English:
| Latin 'terminare, terminat-', to end;  'terminus',
| boundary.  From the limit itself, as in 'term' of
| office or imprisonment, 'term' grew to mean the
| limiting conditions (the 'terms' of an agreement);
| hence, the 'defining' (Latin 'finis', end;  compare
| 'finance') of the idea, as in a 'term' of reproach;
| 'terminology'.  To 'determine' is to set down limits
| or bounds to something, as when you 'determine' to
| perform a task, or as 'determinism' pictures limits
| set to man's freedom.  'Predetermined' follows this
| sense;  but 'extermination' comes later.  Otherwise,
| existence would be 'interminable'.

| Taking it for granted, then, that the inner and outer worlds are
| superposed throughout, without possibility of separation, let us
| now proceed to another point.  There is a third world, besides the
| inner and the outer;  and all three are coëxtensive and contain every
| experience.  Suppose that we have an experience.  That experience has
| three determinations -- three different references to a substratum or
| substrata, lying behind it and determining it.  In the first place,
| it is a determination of an object external to ourselves -- we feel
| that it is so because it is extended in space.  Thereby it is in the
| external world.  In the second place, it is a determination of our own
| soul, it is 'our' experience;  we feel that it is so because it lasts in
| time.  Were it a flash of sensation, there for less than an instant, and
| then utterly gone from memory, we should not have time to think it ours.
| But while it lasts, and we reflect upon it, it enters into the internal
| world.  We have now considered that experience as a determination of the
| modifying object and of the modified soul;  now, I say, it may be and is
| naturally regarded as also a determination of an idea of the Universal
| mind;  a preëxistent, archetypal Idea.  Arithmetic, the law of number,
| 'was' before anything to be numbered or any mind to number had been
| created.  It 'was' though it did not 'exist'.  It was not 'a fact'
| nor a thought, but it was an unuttered word.  'En arche en o logos'.
| We feel an experience to be a determination of such an archetypal
| Logos, by virtue of its // 'depth of tone' / logical intension //,
| and thereby it is in the 'logical world'.
|
| Note the great difference between this view and Hegel's.
| Hegel says, logic is the science of the pure idea.  I should
| describe it as the science of the laws of experience in virtue
| of its being a determination of the idea, or in other words as
| the formal science of the logical world.
|
| In this point of view, efforts to ascertain precisely how the
| intellect works in thinking, -- that is to say investigation
| of internal characterictics -- is no more to the purpose which
| logical writers as such, however vaguely have in view, than
| would be the investigation of external characteristics.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| But not to follow this subject too far, we have
| now established three species of representations:
| 'copies', 'signs', and 'symbols';  of the last of
| which only logic treats.  A second approximation to
| a definition of it then will be, the science of symbols
| in general and as such.  But this definition is still
| too broad;  this might, indeed, form the definition of
| a certain science which would be a branch of Semiotic
| or the general science of representations which might
| be called Symbolistic, and of this logic would be
| a species.  But logic only considers symbols
| from a particular point of view.
|
| A symbol in general and as such has three relations.
| The first is its relation to the pure Idea or Logos
| and this (from the analogy of the grammatical terms
| for the pronouns I, It, Thou) I call its relation
| of the first person, since it is its relation to
| its own essence.  The second is its relation to
| the Consciousness as being thinkable, or to any
| language as being translatable, which I call its
| relation to the second person, since it refers to
| its power of appealing to a mind.  The third is its
| relation to its object, which I call its relation to
| the third person or It.  Every symbol is subject to
| three distinct systems of formal law as conditions
| of its taking up these three relations.  If it
| violates either one of these three codes, the
| condition of its having either of the three
| relations, it ceases to be a symbol and makes
| 'nonsense'.  Nonsense is that which has a certain
| resemblance to a symbol without being a symbol.  But
| since it simulates the symbolic character it is usually
| only one of the three codes which it violates;  at any rate,
| flagrantly.  Hence there should be at least three different kinds
| of nonsense.  And accordingly we remark that that we call nonsense
| meaningless, absurd, or quibbling, in different cases.  If a symbol
| violates the conditions of its being a determination of the pure
| Idea or logos, it may be so nearly a determination thereof as
| to be perfectly intelligible.  If for instance instead
| of 'I am' one should say 'I is'.
| 'I is' is in itself meaningless,
| it violates the conditions of its
| relation to the form it is meant
| to embody.  Thus we see that the
| conditions of the relation of the
| first person are the laws of grammar.
|
| I will now take another example.  I know my opinion is false, still I hold it.
| This is grammatical, but the difficulty is that it violates the conditions
| of its having an object.  Observe that this is precisely the difficulty.
| It not only cannot be a determination of this or that object, but it
| cannot be a determination of any object, whatever.  This is the
| whole difficulty.  I say that, I receive contradictories into
| one opinion or symbolical representation;  now this implies
| that it is a symbol of nothing.  Here is another example:
| This very proposition is false.  This is a proposition to
| which the law of excluded middle namely that every symbol
| must be false or true, does not apply.  For if it is false it
| is thereby true.  And if not false it is thereby not true.  Now
| why does not this law apply to this proposition.  Simply because it
| does itself state that it has no object.  It talks of itself and only
| of itself and has no external relation whatever.  These examples show
| that logical laws only hold good, as conditions of a symbol's having
| an object.  The fact that it has often been called the science of
| truth confirms this view.
|
| I define logic therefore as the science of the conditions
| which enable symbols in general to refer to objects.
|
| At the same time 'symbolistic' in general gives a trivium consisting of
| Universal Grammar, Logic, and Universal Rhetoric, using this last term to
| signify the science of the formal conditions of intelligibility of symbols.

| The consideration of this imperfect datum leads us to make
| a fundamental observation;  namely, that the problem how we
| can make an induction is one and the same with the problem how
| we can make any general statement, with reason;  for there is
| no way left in which such a statement can originate except from
| induction or pure fiction.  Hereby, we strike down at once all
| attempts at solving the problem as involve the supposition of
| a major premiss as a datum.  Such explanations merely show
| that we can arrive at one general statement by deduction
| from another, while they leave the real question,
| untouched.  The peculiar merit of Aristotle's
| theory is that after the objectionable portion
| of it is swept away and after it has thereby been
| left utterly powerless to account for any certainty
| or even probability in the inference from induction,
| we still retain these 'forms' which show what the
| 'actual process' is.
|
| And what is this process?  We have in the apodictic conclusion,
| some most extraordinary observation, as for example that a great
| number of animals -- namely neat and deer, feed only upon vegetables.
| This proposition, be it remarked, need not have had any generality;  if
| the animals observed instead of being all 'neat' had been so very various
| that we knew not what to say of them except that they were 'herbivora' and
| 'cloven-footed', the effect would have been to render the argument simply
| irresistable.  In addition to this datum, we have another;  namely that
| these same animals are all cloven-footed.  Now it would not be so very
| strange that all cloven-footed animals should be herbivora;  animals
| of a particular structure very likely may use a particular food.
| But if this be indeed so, then all the marvel of the conclusion
| is explained away.  So in order to avoid a marvel which must in
| some form be accepted, we are led to believe what is easy to
| believe though it is entirely uncertain.

| There is a large class of reasonings which are neither deductive nor inductive.
| I mean the inference of a cause from its effect or reasoning to a physical hypothesis.
| I call this reasoning 'à posteriori'.  If I reason that certain conduct is wise because
| it has a character which belongs 'only' to wise things, I reason 'à priori'.  If I think
| it is wise because it once turned out to be wise, that is if I infer that it is wise on
| this occasion because it was wise on that occasion, I reason inductively.  But if
| I think it is wise because a wise man does it, I then make the pure hypothesis
| that he does it because he is wise, and I reason 'à posteriori'.  The form
| this reasoning assumes, is that of an inference of a minor premiss in
| any of the figures.  The following is an example.
|
|    Light gives certain fringes.       |    Ether waves give certain fringes.
|    Ether waves gives these fringes.   |    Light is ether waves.
| .: Light is ether waves.              | .: Light gives these fringes.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| We come now to the question, what is the 'rationale' of these three kinds
| of reasoning.  And first let us understand precisely what we intend by this.
| It is clear then that it is none of our business to inquire in what manner we
| think when we reason, for we have already seen that logic is wholly separate
| from psychology.  What we seek is an explicit statement of the logical ground
| of these different kinds of inference.  This logical ground will have two parts,
| 1st the ground of possibility and 2nd the ground of proceedure.  The ground of
| possibility is the special property of symbols upon which every inference of
| a certain kind rests.  The ground of proceedure is the property of symbols
| which makes a certain inference possible from certain premisses.  The
| ground of possibility must be both discovered and demonstrated, fully.
| The ground of proceedure must be exhibited in outline, but it is not
| requisite to fill up all the details of this subject, especially
| as that would lead us too far into the technicalities of logic.
|
| As the three kinds of reasoning are entirely distinct, each must have
| a different ground of possibility;  and the principle of each kind must
| be proved by that same kind of inference for it would be absurd to attempt
| to rest it on a weaker kind of inference and to rest it on one as strong as
| itself would be simply to reduce it to that other kind of reasoning.  Moreover,
| these principles must be logical principles because we do not seek any other
| ground now, than a logical ground.  As logical principles, they will not
| relate to the symbol in itself or in its relation to equivalent symbols
| but wholly in its relation to what it symbolizes.  In other words
| it will relate to the symbolization of objects.

| Now all symbolization is of three objects, at once;  the first is a possible thing,
| the second is a possible form, the third is a possible symbol.  It will be objected
| that the two latter are not properly objects.  We have hitherto regarded the symbol
| as 'standing for' the thing, as a concrete determination of its form, and addressing
| a symbol;  and it is true that it is only by referring to a possible thing that a
| symbol has an objective relation, it is only by bearing in it a form that it has
| any subjective relation, and it is only by equaling another symbol that it has any
| tuistical relation.  But this objective relation once given to a symbol is at once
| applicable to all to which it necessarily refers;  and this is shown by the fact
| of our regarding every symbol as 'connotative' as well as 'denotative', and by our
| regarding one word as standing for another whenever we endeavor to clear up a little
| obscurity of meaning.  And the reason that this is so is that the possible symbol and
| the possible form to which a symbol is related each relate also to that thing which
| is its immediate object.  Things, forms, and symbols, therefore, are symbolized in
| every symbolization.  And this being so, it is natural to suppose that our three
| principles of inference which we know already refer to some three objects of
| symbolization, refer to these.
|
| That such really is the case admits of proof.  For the principle of inference 'à priori'
| must be established 'à priori';  that is by reasoning analytically from determinant to
| determinate, in other words from definition.  But this can only be applied to an object
| whose characteristics depend upon its definition.  Now of most things the definition
| depends upon the character, the definition of a symbol alone determines its character.
| Hence the principle of inference 'à priori' must relate to symbols.  The principle of
| inference 'à posteriori' must be established 'à posteriori', that is by reasoning from
| determinate to determinant.  This is only applicable to that which is determined by what
| it determines;  in other words, to that which is only subject to the truth and falsehood
| which affects its determinant and which in itself is mere 'zero'.  But this is only true
| of pure forms.  Hence the principle of inference 'à posteriori' must relate to pure form.
| The principle of inductive inference must be established inductively;  that is by reasoning
| from parts to whole.  This is only applicable to that whose whole is given in the sum of the
| parts;  and this is only the case with things.  Hence the principle of inductive inference
| must relate to things.

Logic As Semiotic

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Note 1

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| Logic, in its general sense, is, as I believe I have shown, only another name for
|'semiotic' ([Greek: semeiotike]), the quasi-necessary, or formal, doctrine of signs.
| By describing the doctrine as &quot;quasi-necessary&quot;, or formal, I mean that we observe the
| characters of such signs as we know, and from such an observation, by a process which
| I will not object to naming Abstraction, we are led to statements, eminently fallible,
| and therefore in one sense by no means necessary, as to what 'must be' the characters
| of all signs used by a &quot;scientific&quot; intelligence, that is to say, by an intelligence
| capable of learning by experience.  As to that process of abstraction, it is itself
| a sort of observation.  The faculty which I call abstractive observation is one which
| ordinary people perfectly recognize, but for which the theories of philosophers sometimes
| hardly leave room.  It is a familiar experience to every human being to wish for something
| quite beyond his present means, and to follow that wish by the question, &quot;Should I wish for
| that thing just the same, if I had ample means to gratify it?&quot;  To answer that question, he
| searches his heart, and in doing so makes what I term an abstractive observation.  He makes
| in his imagination a sort of skeleton diagram, or outline sketch, of himself, considers what
| modifications the hypothetical state of things would require to be made in that picture, and
| then examines it, that is, 'observes' what he has imagined, to see whether the same ardent
| desire is there to be discerned.  By such a process, which is at bottom very much like
| mathematical reasoning, we can reach conclusions as to what 'would be' true of signs
| in all cases, so long as the intelligence using them was scientific.  (CP 2.227).

| Logic is an analysis of forms not a study of the mind.
| It tells 'why' an inference follows not 'how' it arises
| in the mind.  It is the business therefore of the logician
| to break up complicated inferences from numerous premisses
| into the simplest possible parts and not to leave them
| as they are.
