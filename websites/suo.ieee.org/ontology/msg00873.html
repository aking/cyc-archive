Dear Martin,

See comments below.

PS. I appreciate the clarifying role you are taking. It is valuable.

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Matthew,  many thanks for your reply, and your gradings 
&gt; are too, too
&gt; kind!!
&gt; 
&gt; At long last I feel I am getting a clear idea of your overall approach
&gt; (though I should warn that is not the same thing as agreeing with it).

MW: You should have seen the hard time I gave the people trying to persuade
me about 4D.

&gt; This has come through a reading your document  "Some Notes on 
&gt; the Nature of
&gt; Things", and the reply below.
&gt; 
&gt; I have one questions on the text of the document, and some 
&gt; comments below.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. You say in the document "[the temporal relationship approach] does
&gt; eventually cause problems."  If you could give me any 
&gt; specific examples of
&gt; problems this would be very helpful.

MW: The thing to bear in mind is that a temporal relationship represents one
of the following:

 - a state of one object that is a member of a class (classification)
 - the states of two objects that are related timelessly (composition,
connection)
 - the state of one object that is also a state of another object
(installation, assignment to position)

The problems are 2 fold.

 - the different patterns that temporal associations hide can lead to a
misunderstanding of what is really going on (they all seem to be the same
when they are not)
 - when the states that are hidden in the associations become of interest in
their own right, independent of the association they are part of, then there
is data duplication, which may not be recognised.

The first caused us in practice quite a lot of trouble in misunderstanding
the nature of many things. The second was more of a nuisance, but was an
indication that something was wrong - conceptual models really shouldn't
have redundancy.
&gt; 
&gt; I am just sending this to you, but have no objection to future wider
&gt; publication.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; MW: In a 4D world, as I recall, I said that there exists a 
&gt; set for every
&gt; possible combination of things (including sets). The good 
&gt; news is that we
&gt; don't have to be interested in them. The ones we are 
&gt; interested in have
&gt; some
&gt; significance and we give them a name and generally call them 
&gt; classes. These
&gt; are abstract objects and do not exist in (i.e. are 
&gt; independent of) space
&gt; time, but do exist in some sense. Relationships (actual or 
&gt; otherwise) are
&gt; the same. For every pair (triple, etc) of objects there is a 
&gt; relationship.
&gt; It is an abstract object, in that its existance is 
&gt; independent of space
&gt; time. Again the good news is that we don't have to be 
&gt; interested in many of
&gt; them. Those that we are interested in we put into relations 
&gt; (actual or not
&gt; as may be) i.e. we classify them. I rely here in part on the fact that
&gt; relations can be derived from sets.
&gt; 
&gt; MK&gt; Fine.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Now that is an exposition of the background. The 
&gt; important question is
&gt; what does that mean when I want to say, perhaps, that something was
&gt; purchased, say our lawnmower?
&gt; 
&gt; MW: There is an activity which we can denote by the constant a. A is a
&gt; member of the class Purchase, which is a subtype of activity. 
&gt; At the start
&gt; of the activity there is a spatio-temporal extent b that is 
&gt; classified as a
&gt; whole lawnmower (whole here indicates the spatio-temporal 
&gt; extent that is
&gt; the
&gt; lawnmower for the whole of its life). More particularly there 
&gt; is a state of
&gt; this that is owned by a matching state of the person or 
&gt; company that owns
&gt; the lawnmower, in this case Carter's. There is a timeless ownership
&gt; relationship between these two spatio-temporal extents (all the time
&gt; elements are in the states that are related, so the 
&gt; relationship is always
&gt; true and timeless). The purchase activity causes the 
&gt; termination of the
&gt; state of the lawnmower that was owned by Carter's, and the 
&gt; start of the
&gt; state of the lawnmower that is owned by me. The event(s) are 
&gt; the temporal
&gt; boundary of the states and are at a point in time. Whether 
&gt; there is a gap
&gt; between the ownership states is arbitrary.
&gt; 
&gt; MK&gt; If I understand this correctly you are saying there is:
&gt; 1. an STE (spatio-temporal extent) which is the whole of the 
&gt; life of the
&gt; mower
&gt; 2. an STE of the mower that is its state that is owned by Carters
&gt; 3. an STE of the mower that is its state that is owned by Matthew
&gt; 4. an STE of Carter's that is the whole of the life of the business
&gt; 5. an STE of Carter's that is the state that owns the mower
&gt; 6. an STE of Matthew that is the whole of your life
&gt; 7. an STE of Matthew that is the state that owns the mower
&gt; Suppose you also owned a spade, and the period for which you 
&gt; own the spade
&gt; overlaps with, but is different from, the period for which you own the
&gt; mower then
&gt; 8. an STE of the spade which is the whole life of the spade
&gt; 9. an STE of the spade that is its state that is owned by Matthew
&gt; 10. an STE of Matthew that is the state that owns the spade
&gt; There are timeless relationships between STE's 2&amp;5, 3&amp;7, and 
&gt; between 9&amp;10
&gt; and the periods within each pair are identical.
&gt; The period of 10 overlaps that of 7 but is not identical
&gt; Have I got the STE's right?  If so, how do you handle the 
&gt; timestamps that
&gt; define the STE's and ensure their mutual integrity?  What 
&gt; does this model
&gt; offer that comparable temporal relationships could not? How 
&gt; do I interpret
&gt; STE 6 (the whole life of Matthew) and the two (in general N) 
&gt; STE's that are
&gt; states of Matthew at a time when they overlap?
&gt; 
&gt; MW: What you will notice is that what I am describing here is 
&gt; somewhat more
&gt; precise than what is normally represented. This is why I say that a 4D
&gt; ontology is well placed to define and interrelate other 
&gt; ontologies, which
&gt; is
&gt; where my primary interest lies.
&gt; 
&gt; MK&gt; Absolutely in sympathy with this interest and the best 
&gt; way we can find
&gt; to achieve it.
&gt;
