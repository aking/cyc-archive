Jim,
I think that most , if not all, of the CYC upper ontology has been declared
to
be available without charge.  

JS: Yes, but it still has copyright restrictions.  

Some portion of it (I think the parts that enable
it to work with CYC lower ontologies) is still private.  I know they reserve
the
right to change the ontology without notice.

Asking for a copyright for all future versions in all possible media seems
excessive.  

JS: The "all future versions"  refers to versions of SUO, not the submitted
document.  The copyright release would be only on the version of the
document sumitted, not its future versions.

A letter  from CYC stating that IEEE may use this (whatever they
choose to make public) without payment seems reasonable.  I would suggest to
Doug that the terms of the release prohibit SUO / IEEE / ISO etc. from
charging
for use of the SUO ontology or any ontologies that are derived from CYC in
whole
or in part. 

JS: We have agreement from IEEE that SUO will be free, but there's no way of
telling what else might follow or be based on SUO, so I don't know how we
could make such an agreement.  Actually, IEEE doesn't charge for use of its
standards, it charges for copies.  In talking to Doug, I think the fact that
SUO will be free is adequate for him.

 The prohibition for requiring payment for use should also include
administrative fees or development expenses, membership dues, etc. 

JS: Same as above.

 Further the
release should not be transferable to other organizations or companies
(profit
ot non-profit).  CYC may chose to do so in the future, but not IEEE.

Agree.  I think this goes without saying, but it can be spelled out if
needed.

Jim

&gt;         A 'copyright release' is not giving away the copyright, it's just
&gt; allowing someone else to  modify it, copyright the new version, and
&gt; distribute it. Cyc would still retain their original copyright.
&gt;
&gt;          I talked to Doug Lenat and he seemed very open to submitting his
&gt; Cyc Upper Ontology to SUO (with a signed copyright release letter), but he
&gt; hasn't sent in the signed letter.
&gt;
&gt;         Companies (including Microsoft) do this all the time, so let's not
&gt; assume we know what Cyc would determine to be in their business interests.
&gt;
&gt;         Below is the template for a copyright release letter.

&gt; &gt;; b) going
&gt; &gt;with CYC, if a suitable copyright release letter can be obtained.
&gt;
&gt; Forget that option. Doug is not about to give away his company for
&gt; the good of the world, and neither should he feel any obligation to,
&gt; after the work he and about 50 others have put into it for over a
&gt; decade. This would be like asking Bill Gates to make Windows 2000
&gt; into freeware.
