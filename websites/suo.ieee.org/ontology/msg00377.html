I endorse Pat Hayes' vote:

&gt;I vote NO.

&gt;Comments: I don't mean to denigrate Niles' hard work, but it is 
&gt;ridiculously premature to adopt this (or anything else like this) as 
&gt;a base document. This document doesnt even come close to the 
&gt;requirement for a base document given in the accompanying text.

I agree with Pat that Niles has done some hard work in putting
together the work of several other people whose efforts have
been merged (including some of my own).  But the act of
translating those independent collections of axioms into a
common notation does not cause them to be integrated.

Pat continues:

&gt;It has no overall coherent ontological model; it represents a melange 
&gt;of conflicting and incommensurate views on many basic ontological issues.

I agree with the first line above, but I disagree with the
second line that those collections are "conflicting".  On the
contrary, they are consistent with one another for the very
simple reason that they are unrelated to one another.  Whether
they become "conflicting and incommensurate" would depend on
how they are used together.  But the really hard work involves
determining how or when they could or should be used together. 

I agree with the general tenor of Pat's further criticisms,
but there is much more to be said about the details of the
issues involved:

&gt;Its axioms have no global coherence (for example: the 
&gt;intended meaning of the quantifiers varies from one place to another 
&gt;in the document; later axioms do not conform to the categories 
&gt;introduced in the earlier axioms; many, if not most, of the major 
&gt;classifications depend on questionable and controversial philosphical 
&gt;presuppositions.) It fails to address many of the basic ontological 
&gt;issues that ned to be got clear before we can put any ontology to 
&gt;practical use (how to represent time and change, how to deal with 
&gt;alternative courses of reality, for example. ) Moreover, it is clear 
&gt;that the more 'pieces' are added to it, the more these problems are 
&gt;going to get worse rather than better.
&gt;
&gt;This methodology is fundamentally flawed. There is no way to achieve 
&gt;a coherent ontology by 'merging' axioms from incommensurate 
&gt;ontological perspectives in this simplistic way. It is rather like 
&gt;trying to create a large piece of software by just adjoining pieces 
&gt;of code written by different authors in different computer languages, 
&gt;and expecting it to magically work.
&gt;
&gt;Apart from the general issues of a lack of a coherent methodology, I 
&gt;have many particular problems with much of the actual content of the 
&gt;document. As it stands, the ontology it outlines would be unworkable 
&gt;for me for almost any practical purpose, even if it were globally 
&gt;coherent. But this is not the right place to go into details.

I believe that Pat and I agree on one fundamental point:
much more work is needed on the foundations and methodology.
