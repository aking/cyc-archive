&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; Those are useful questions to ask:
&gt;
&gt; [Jon Awbrey wrote:]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here's a chance for me to ask some of my favorite questions again:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  a.  What forms of reasoning are involved in the decision of a DBA
&gt; &gt;         to create, modify, remove a concept from the conceptual base?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     b.  Can these putative forms of reasoning
&gt; &gt;         be computationally formalized?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  a.  What entropic pressures or informational tensions
&gt; &gt;         determine a decision to introduce, modify, delete
&gt; &gt;         concepts, symbols, terms to/in/from the manifold
&gt; &gt;         of those already present in the system?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     b.  Can these pressures or tensions be localized and measured?
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest that you work on them.

John,

Been there, still doing that, after all these years.

More to come, so stay tuned to this channel ...

David,

Now that you have had time to cook up your own story,
I will try fill in some more details of what I think
that I had in mind here, as I seem to recall that we
discussed a similar set of topics way back last year,
regarding the issue of a "Maintainable Body" for SUO.

PC:  Yes, I think that being able to define *all* of the
     specialized concepts anyone might want to use should be
     the goal of the SUO, otherwise its function of enabling
     interoperability would be compromised.  Mike Uschold is
     correct, of course, that at any given point it is likely
     that someone may discover that the existing inventory
     of concepts is inadequate to express something in
     a particular field.

PC:  When that happens:  (1) It should be brought to the attention
     of the maintaining body so that the deficiency can be corrected, ...

Jon Awbrey wrote:

JA:  Wouldn't it be better to deliver a "maintainable body", in other words,
     to build in a bit of automation for this task -- measures of structural
     distress, means of structural amendment, and so on -- to help with the
     almost inevitable reconstruction, re-instruction, and restructuring of
     the ontology, whether major, middle, or minor in scope or in level?

David Whitten wrote:

DW:  Jon, I think this is a great idea. I would love to see
     a suggestion of which predicates and other types of
     statements (object level and meta level) you think
     would facilitate recognizing these problems and
     producing a maintainable body.  I must confess,
     the ways I would try to attain the goals you
     have expressed are outside my understanding
     of the scope and purpose of the SUO as has
     been discussed on the group.  I would write
     a program that generated a report on elements
     in the ontology that were problematic.  How do
     you see the ontology providing this information
     which seems to be highly self-reflective of the
     ontology as a whole?

Now, that business about the "manifold", as in the
unification thereof via the catalysis of a concept,
is meant to keep reminding myself of the idea that
Peirce in his adolescence borrowed from Kant, that
matured over time into the whole theory of inquiry.
This brings back to mind a long discussion that I
had with several denizens of the Peirce List last
year, and I think it might help to splice it here:

Arien Malec wrote:

AM:  When Chomsky questioned whether for Peirce inductive procedures provide
     only post hoc guidance to abduction (note that I'm moving to a paraphrase
     of selected quotations from a paper I haven't read), I suspect he is asking
     whether the familiar sort of induction (generalization from sample to whole)
     plays a part in abduction, or whether that sort of reasoning is post hoc.

Jon Awbrey wrote:

JA:  Can you tell me which statements that Chomsky made are the ones that you
     interpret to say that he questions "whether for Peirce inductive procedures
     provide only post hoc guidance to abduction"?  I either missed them or read
     them in another way.

Cathy Legg wrote:

CL:  I guess I'm having trouble getting my head around how
     induction could play this this sort of role, given that
     abductions arise when a phenomenon appears surprising and
     irregular.  Would this be a possible example -- I'm waiting
     for my morning bus and it doesn't arrive:  surprise.  I then
     think -- in the past sometimes my bus hasn't arrived when it's
     a public holiday I've forgotten about:  this case should be the
     same (induction), I then form the hypothesis that it is a public
     holiday (abduction).

Jon Awbrey wrote:

JA:  Here is my analysis of your "Missing the Bus"
     problem, to the extent that it can be represented
     within the constraints of "propositional models"
     or "sentential logic".

JA:  C = Current situation, that is, your current situation under
     the circumstances of the problem in question, represented by
     a "circle" in a venn diagram.  This is just a cheap propositional
     gimmick for covering, to some extent, the indexical characterisitics
     of the situation in question without resorting to using variables
     that range over domains of "individual situations".

JA:  Next, consider the alternative possibilities:

     Proposition X  =  [C =&gt; A]
                    =  [In the Current situation, the bus Arrives]

     Proposition Y  =  [C =&gt; ~A]
                    =  [In the Current situation, the bus does Not Arrive]

JA:  As it happens, X is your expectation, while Y is your observation.
     This difference between your expectation and your observation is
     what you affectively experience as a surprise.

JA:  Let me stress this.  The observed fact is Y, but what renders it
     surprising is its difference from X, and this occurs on the point
     of detaching its consequent.

JA:  Incidentally, it is this "differential" aspect of inquiry
     that led me, starting about a decade ago, to begin to develop
     a "differential logic", extending "propositional calculus" in
     almost precisely the same way that differential calculus extends
     analytic geometry.

JA:  But let us get back to your situation.

JA:  The way that induction enters this situation
     is as a component of previous cycles of inquiry
     that led to the formation of a rule, even if it is
     only a "probable approximate rule", more or less to
     the following effect:

     Proposition K  =  [B =&gt; A]
                    =  [In the Best case scenario, the bus Arrives]

JA:  It does not affect the analysis at all if you have in mind another
     sort of descriptor than "best", say, "normal", "ordinary", or so on,
     so long as you acknowledge the conducive function or the mediating role
     of any middle term like B.

JA:  When you get to the bus stop, you are actually in a somewhat confused,
     indeterminate, uncertain, or vague state of mind, in the sense that
     you have probably not even stopped to ask yourself the question:

JA:  Question Q  =  [Is it really true that J?]

     where:

     Proposition J  =  [C =&gt; B]
                    =  [The Current situation is a Best case scenario]

JA:  Consequently, you have walked, or ran, as is frequently the case,
     right into your current situation, operating under the influence
     of something like the following form of automatic deduction:

      Case J:  C =&gt; B
      Rule K:  B =&gt; A
     -----------------
      Fact X:  C =&gt; A

JA:  And this is just where we came in, with the discrepancy between
     the expected fact X : C =&gt; A and the observed fact Y : C =&gt; ~A.

JA:  The surprise that you meet with, instead of the bus, might lead you
     question all sorts of things.  Any number of speculations might come
     to mind.  Among the more rational possibilities, the surprise might
     cause you to inquire into any and all of the premisses that fed into
     the above deduction, if not the axioms of the logic that you happen
     to be employing at the time.

JA:  But let us suppose that you focus on the case C =&gt; B, as it is most
     frequently the case that is the cause of the problem, and therefore,
     in accord with a higher order induction in the inquiry into inquiry,
     it is most frequently the case that rational people consider first.

JA:  And so, after reflecting on the situation, and eliciting certain features
     of how your habitual reasoning processes fed into it, quasi modo intuitio,
     you decide to vary the description of the case, in this case, from saying
     that C =&gt; B to asking whether it might not be true that C =&gt; ~B, that is,
     asking yourself, "Can it be that the current situation is not actually the
     best (modal, normal, ordinary, usual, ...) case, and that this is the cause
     of my expectation being disappointed?"

JA:  Oops!  I've run out of time for today, so I will have to look at the
     rest later, but I think that the foregoing is the gist of how I see
     the process of inquiry working its way out in situations like these.
