JA:  Please define "Join".
     It 'is' required to support 'your' view.

MW:  Au contraire it is required to support your view.

MW:  I will be truly surprised if a man of your considerable knowledge
     is not completely aware of what an SQL inner join is.  If not I am
     inclined to suggest that you consult an SQL manual, or perhaps the
     SQL3 standard (if that is still the latest version) and look it up.
     If you do know I suggest you say where you are going instead of
     playing games.  It would really be nice to get to the point here.

Matthew,

What is important here?

You have put forth a claim that all k-adic relations
can be defined in terms of at most 2-adic relations.

This, if true, would be important for almost too many reasons
to mention, ranging from achieving maximum clarity and optimal
efficiency in everything from our basic conceptual frameworks
to our computational implementations of relational databases
and logical knowledge bases.  If it is not true, then there
are many reasons why we need to know that, too, as it bears
on the question of a "mininally adequate resource base" for
supporting all of these tasks and more.

Aside from the content of the specific claim that you have made,
of a sort that is commonly recognized in all formal disciplines
to require of its proposer either a detailed definition or an
explicit proof, there is a way in which it can serve us as an
object example, of how and how not to carry on the activities
of analysis, clarification, construction, definition, proof,
and so on -- kind of like a test case to cut our teeth on,
to see whether we really know how to do these things in
such a way that we can eventually settle on clear ends.

So, all in all, I think that it is kind of important,
and I believe that clarity and effectiveness in all
of the components that I have just mentioned above
are topics of major import to the task of building
a SUO, and so I will continue to import them.

As to the present moment in our discussions,
I am afraid that ball remains in your court.
You have made a claim and you must defend it
or give it up -- I did not make up the rules.
I said that I would help you formalize it if
it could be formalized -- laying your hand
on this or that good book and swearing that
it's the truth may indeed be a common brand
of formalization, but it is not the species
that it is accepted in this court of inquiry,
and until you say where in what good book it
says so, no public forum can begin to examine
your evidence.  I am perfectly aware of what
logical operations are logically involved in
the construction of all sorts of joins, and
I have been since the days when I grad-assed
as a data archivist and statistical programmer,
which is why I do not say the things you say,
but it is you who cannot see the AND's at
the bottom of these nests, and so I have
been trying to magnify them for you,
because you still seem to me like
an honest entomologist.

There are, indeed, even larger reasons why this point is important,
and specifically with regard to the problems of intercommunication
and interoperation, which, as you can well appreciate, are not any
kinds of new problems that have just appeared on the human horizon,
but have, in effect if not in essence, been with us since we began
to be human.  And folks like me who have spent a lifetime not just
speculating on these problems from our armchairs but who have come
up against the obstinate resilience and the obstructive resistance
of these barriers to just about everything that we try to do, well,
we take these problems deadpan seriously -- humor, to those in the
know, is just a symptom of how deadly serious we know it, at heart,
to be -- and some of us even fancy that we may have learned one or
two things from the knocks that we have taken, although, of course,
it could be nothing more than the final stages of punch-drunkeness.

Jon Awbrey
