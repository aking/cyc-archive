Jean-Marc,

I am recouping the content of your earlier note on this subject,
as I have been meaning to get back to it for quite some time,
as this was a topic of great mystery to me at the time that
Sue and I wrote our Inquiry paper.  I used to have all of
my bookmarks -- you remember, the little slips of paper
that we used to insert in materially realized books,
but, of course, that is just another form of matter,
neither essentially nor substantially distinct from
the e-lectures that we are batting about the e-there
here? -- all in place, with parallel passages marked
in Aristotle and in Peirce, but now all that work is
a shambles of scrambled eggs of intentions that have
been permuted almost irreversibly through four moves
of our glassy menagerie.  Where was I? -- oh yes! --
back to entelechy.  Permute me to free associate for
a while, and collect a few bits of raw source matter,
since this is my usual "method" when I do not know
where I am going or where I ought to be headed.

Jean-Marc Orliaguet wrote (31 Mar 2001 18:29:13 +0200):

JM:  You are mentioning Aristotle's "entelechy" in your article
     "Interpretation as Action:  The Risk of Inquiry".

JA:  For the sake of re-orientation, let me quote a piece of the
     context where the concept of entelechy came up in our paper:

| Peirce gave the following definition of a sign in
| his 1902 "Application to the Carnegie Institution":
|
| | Logic is 'formal semiotic'.  A sign is something, 'A',
| | which brings something, 'B', its 'interpretant' sign,
| | determined or created by it, into the same sort of
| | correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with
| | something, 'C', its 'object', as that in which
| | itself stands to 'C'.  This definition no more
| | involves any reference to human thought than
| | does the definition of a line as the place
| | within which a particle lies during
| | a lapse of time.
| |
| | Peirce, NE 4, 54.
|
| There are two important features to note in this portrayal
| of the role of signs in logic.  First, Peirce's goal is to
| differentiate the formal and the material aspects of thought
| and inquiry.  This attempt is motivated by his interest in
| a certain question:  "What is the relation of matter and form
| in the actuality of the mind ('entelechy') and is their synthesis
| a 'third something' or not?"  This helps us understand how Peirce
| can be concerned with developing a formal characterization of
| signs and sign processes without being just another "formalist".
| His interest is partly due to the influence of Aristotle, whose
| dictum that "soul is form" is given in the following text:
|
| | So the soul ('psyche') must be substance ('ousia') in the sense
| | of being the form ('eidos') of a natural body ('soma'), which
| | potentially ('dynamei') has life.  And substance in this sense
| | is actuality ('entelecheia').
| |
| | Aristotle, 'De Anima', II.i. 412a20.

I can tell you that the original version of our paper cited
the whole section of Aristotle's 'On the Soul' that led up
to this quotation, but most of that had to be edited out
for reasons of space.  I have continued to explore this
topic in my dissertation, so let me give you a link to
the sort of development that we had in mind at the time,
which I am hoping I can come to understand someday soon,
as the way that Aristotle introduces "matter" and "form"
may strike one as rather counter-intuitive at first sight.
Here is how I treat it in a recent draft of my dissertation:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~FORMAL~MATTER~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Due to the importance of Aristotle's account for every
discussion that follows it, not to mention for the many
that follow it without knowing it, and because the issues
that it raises arise repeatedly throughout this work, I am
going to cite an extended extract from the relevant text
(Aristotle, 'Peri Psyche', 2.1), breaking up the argument
into a number of individual premisses, stages, and examples.

Aristotle wrote:

a.  The theories of the soul (psyche)
    handed down by our predecessors have
    been sufficiently discussed;  now let
    us start afresh, as it were, and try to
    determine (diorisai) what the soul is,
    and what definition (logos) of it will
    be most comprehensive (koinotatos).

b.  We describe one class of existing things as
    substance (ousia), and this we subdivide into
    three:  (1) matter (hyle), which in itself is
    not an individual thing, (2) shape (morphe) or
    form (eidos), in virtue of which individuality
    is directly attributed, and (3) the compound
    of the two.

c.  Matter is potentiality (dynamis), while form is
    realization or actuality (entelecheia), and the
    word actuality is used in two senses, illustrated
    by the possession of knowledge (episteme) and the
    exercise of it (theorein).

d.  Bodies (somata) seem to be pre-eminently
    substances, and most particularly those
    which are of natural origin (physica),
    for these are the sources (archai)
    from which the rest are derived.

e.  But of natural bodies some have life (zoe)
    and some have not;  by life we mean the
    capacity for self-sustenance, growth,
    and decay.

f.  Every natural body (soma physikon), then,
    which possesses life must be substance, and
    substance of the compound type (synthete).

g.  But since it is a body of a definite kind, viz.,
    having life, the body (soma) cannot be soul (psyche),
    for the body is not something predicated of a subject,
    but rather is itself to be regarded as a subject,
    i.e., as matter.

h.  So the soul must be substance in the sense of being
    the form of a natural body, which potentially has life.
    And substance in this sense is actuality.

i.  The soul, then, is the actuality of the kind of body we
    have described.  But actuality has two senses, analogous
    to the possession of knowledge and the exercise of it.

j.  Clearly (phaneron), actuality in our present sense
    is analogous to the possession of knowledge;  for both
    sleep (hypnos) and waking (egregorsis) depend upon the
    presence of the soul, and waking is analogous to the
    exercise of knowledge, sleep to its possession (echein)
    but not its exercise (energein).

k.  Now in one and the same person the
    possession of knowledge comes first.

l.  The soul may therefore be defined as the first actuality
    of a natural body potentially possessing life;  and such
    will be any body which possesses organs (organikon).

m.  The parts of plants are organs too, though very
    simple ones:  e.g., the leaf protects the pericarp,
    and the pericarp protects the seed;  the roots are
    analogous to the mouth, for both these absorb food.

n.  If then one is to find a definition which will apply
    to every soul, it will be "the first actuality of
    a natural body possessed of organs".

o.  So one need no more ask (zetein) whether body and
    soul are one than whether the wax (keros) and the
    impression (schema) it receives are one, or in
    general whether the matter of each thing is
    the same as that of which it is the matter;
    for admitting that the terms unity and being
    are used in many senses, the paramount (kyrios)
    sense is that of actuality.

p.  We have, then, given a general definition
    of what the soul is:  it is substance in
    the sense of formula (logos), i.e., the
    essence of such-and-such a body.

q.  Suppose that an implement (organon), e.g. an axe,
    were a natural body;  the substance of the axe
    would be that which makes it an axe, and this
    would be its soul;  suppose this removed, and
    it would no longer be an axe, except equivocally.
    As it is, it remains an axe, because it is not of
    this kind of body that the soul is the essence or
    formula, but only of a certain kind of natural body
    which has in itself a principle of movement and rest.

r.  We must, however, investigate our definition
    in relation to the parts of the body.

s.  If the eye were a living creature, its soul would be
    its vision;  for this is the substance in the sense
    of formula of the eye.  But the eye is the matter
    of vision, and if vision fails there is no eye,
    except in an equivocal sense, as for instance
    a stone or painted eye.

t.  Now we must apply what we have found true of the part
    to the whole living body.  For the same relation must
    hold good of the whole of sensation to the whole sentient
    body qua sentient as obtains between their respective parts.

u.  That which has the capacity to live is not the body
    which has lost its soul, but that which possesses
    its soul;  so seed and fruit are potentially bodies
    of this kind.

v.  The waking state is actuality in the same sense
    as the cutting of the axe or the seeing of the eye,
    while the soul is actuality in the same sense as the
    faculty of the eye for seeing, or of the implement for
    doing its work.

w.  The body is that which exists potentially;  but just as
    the pupil and the faculty of seeing make an eye, so in
    the other case the soul and body make a living creature.

x.  It is quite clear, then, that neither the soul nor
    certain parts of it, if it has parts, can be separated
    from the body;  for in some cases the actuality belongs
    to the parts themselves.  Not but what there is nothing
    to prevent some parts being separated, because they are
    not actualities of any body.

y.  It is also uncertain (adelon) whether the soul as an
    actuality bears the same relation to the body as the
    sailor (ploter) to the ship (ploion).

z.  This must suffice as an attempt to determine
    in rough outline the nature of the soul.

Here is a study aid to assist with the reading of
the text.  What I think is especially relevant to
our purposes -- aside from the content of these
fundamental categories or "basemental concepts"
that echo in the everyday constitutions of our
minds and still support, if a bit contingently,
the greater parts of our thinking even today --
is the method that Aristotle uses, working through
analogy and prototype, or the well-chosen example,
to articulate, build, construe, derive, and apply,
in a recursive process, his system of abstractions.

So consider the following "Alignments of Capacities"
as you read Aristotle's text:

---------------------------------------------------
       Matter       |            Form
---------------------------------------------------
    Potentiality    |          Actuality
    Receptivity     |  Possession  |   Exercise
       Life         |    Sleep     |    Waking
       Wax          |          Impression
       Axe          |    Edge      |   Cutting
       Eye          |   Vision     |    Seeing
       Body         |            Soul
---------------------------------------------------
       Ship?        |           Sailor?

JM:  How do you see the relation between entelechy and
     Peirce's succession of interpretants in semiosis?

JM:  I found this quote in "New Elements", EP2 ['Essential Peirce', Volume 2]:

JA:  I corrected a few typos and inserted single quotes for italics.

     | Of the two great tasks of humanity, 'Theory' and 'Practice', the former sets out
     | from a sign of a real object with which it is 'acquainted', passing from this,
     | as its 'matter', to successive interpretants embodying more and more fully
     | its 'form', wishing ultimately to reach a direct 'perception' of the
     | entelechy;  while the latter, setting out from a sign signifying
     | a character of which it 'has an idea', passes from this, as
     | its 'form', to successive interpretants realizing more and
     | more precisely its 'matter', hoping ultimately to be able
     | to make a direct 'effort', producing the entelechy.
     |
     | CSP, "New Elements", EP2, p.304.

JM:  Which I understand this way:

     - "matter" corresponds to the real object (the "Truth" of Being)

     - "form" is the object not in its entire being but as formally represented
        by the sign (the sign signifies, denotes the object in its characters only)

     - entelechy is reached when "being and being represented are the same"
       (synthesis of form and matter)

JM:  But The question is: what sort of determinism do we have here:

     - one-way determinism:  form determines matter (or the opposite ...)

     - or is it truely a dialectical process and the only thing that is determined
       is the fact that in the end the process (succession of interpretants) tends
       towards reaching the entelechy?

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Jean-Marc Orliaguet wrote (31 May 2001 11:02:25 +0200):

JM:  In "Sketch of Dichotomic Mathematics" (NEM), which I quote from the Web
     since I don't have the book here with me, Peirce writes in substance:

     | The nature of signs:  sign and related notions,
     | especially form, law, habit and entelechy;
     | sign as having its being in the power,
     | not act, of determining matter;
     | sign as entelechy.
     |
     | [emph. mine]

Is this just notes?  I am having trouble finding this exactly in NE 4.

I find, for example:

| It is to be observed that a sign has its being
| in the 'power' to bring about a determination
| of a Matter to a Form, not in an 'act' of
| bringing it about.  (CSP, NE 4, 300).

 
JM:  In the same text, Peirce argues that signs are not entirely 'form', and not
     entirely 'matter' either.  The being of a sign is to connect form and matter,
     i.e. to give form to, or to determine matter.  The impression that I get is
     that you confine signs to their form only, and forget the 'matter' side of signs.

Hardly!  The "physical symbol system hypothesis" (PSSH) --
"yet another not quite acknowledged borrowing" (YANQAB) from Peirce,
has been a cornerstone of AI and a staple of my thought from the start.

I have to break here,
return tuit later on,

Jon Awbrey

JM:  Peirce wrote it in "New Elements":  signs exist in replicas,
     i.e. in concrete things that represent.  But their being is not
     the being of these replicas since a replica in itself has no generality.
     To reduce signs to concrete things is therefore a bit of a nonsense, unless
     one writes "a concrete thing that represents", i.e. a being whose nature is
     also relational.  The idea is really difficult to grasp because one is used
     to think about either form or matter, but one seldom conceives the being of
     something as entelechy.  And what else is entelechy?

JM:  Now to get back to the subject, the formal definition in L75 is about the
     formal aspect of signs only, purely relational, i.e. how signs take part
     in the triadic relation, every reference to matter is removed.  But the
     other side of the story is that the power of signs is to inform matter
     in semiosis (energetic interpretants., etc. ...), in order to determine
     minds in reference to the sign's object.  Otherwise if signs could not
     determine matter, there would be no sign action at all.  This is why
     I insist on asking:  what is 'matter' when 'form' determines 'matter'
     in semiosis?  what else except mind can be determined, informed in
     reference to something else, ... sunflowers?

Jon Awbrey wrote (26 May 2001 22:56:24 -0400):

JA:  Let us leave the surly bonds of sumo russellers behind --
     and not just because I suspect their matches are fixed --
     but because their contentment with presocratic manners
     of thinking will never hear a word of Plato, Aristotle,
     much less of Peirce.  And I have just been enlightened
     why all of my warnings about icebergs were in vain, as
     that vehicle was not designed to fly the standard of a
     research vessel, nor any kind of a seagoing craft, but
     only the party banners of a museum ship, anchored in a
     drydock in the middle of a desert in Arizona.  Clearly,
     all talk of icebergs about, much less of risky inquiry,
     is doomed to sound just as absurd as the piped-in surf
     on their shore.

JA:  Now, the broader questions that I keep hearing in your
     remarks strike my ears as questions about the relation
     of experience and reason, matter and form, descriptive
     and normative sciences.  And I just can't imagine what
     I ever said that made you think that when I write "and"
     that my secret meaning is "versus".  But it appears to
     me that the whole problem turns on the interpretations
     of words like "accidental", "essential", "independent",
     and of that peculiar usage that I have noted before in
     which a mathematical writer will often use the functor
     "non" as a generalizing operator, almost as if it were
     to mean "not of necessity", for instance, the way that
     mathematicians apply "non-associative" or "non-linear".

JA:  This, to me, is the secret key to understanding what Peirce
     may have meant by a "non-psychological conception of logic".
     For if "non" is meant to generalize the domain, then it but
     widens the circle of interest from human psychology to what
     is more generic, and does not draw off to a separate corner.
     It does not say that a descriptive science of "how we think"
     does not busy itself with an important part of the material
     from which the forms of logic are typically abstracted, but
     only that it can enjoy but a species interest when comes to
     constituting the necessary nature of this normative science.

JA:  OK, I feel like I am saying things that ought to be obvious,
     so I will stop until the occasion when I discover otherwise.
