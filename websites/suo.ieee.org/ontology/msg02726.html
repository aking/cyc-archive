Jean-Marc,

Because this conversation is on (or over) the verge
of degenreating into a quibble among people who think
they know Peirce best, I feel a constant need to remind
even myself of what its general relevance might be, and
so I will make yet another continuing try at explaining
what I think it is, and maybe even to abstract away from
the re:finer details of the Peirce interpretation gambit.
So permit me to back up a bit, and to take the long view.

I do not know how your life has been -- as for myself, I never had to
go looking for problems, they always found me well enough on their own.
So what makes a thing be a "pragma", descriptively speaking, via an old
word for an "object" of one's own affair, business, concern, or interest,
is just a given -- there it is!  and there it is, again!  These pragmata,
in their species of (1) "premonitions", (2) "problems", (3) "surprises",
just as I personally draft to classify them, do call out for some response
on our part -- apart from the circumstance that they just keep on happening,
that is part of what makes them be "what's a pragmata" -- still, these acts,
correspondingly (1) "innominate", (2) "plan of action", (3) "explanation",
all come later, logically speaking, if not really in their temporal order.

Okay, so first there were the pragmata that presented themselves to me
in my life, all unbidden, and then there was the response that ensued,
as I would subsequently go looking for the corresponding correlate of
an address, answer, apparatus, approach, approximation that might fit.
For me, this is where Peirce came in, while I was looking for whatever
help that I could find, largely because he was one of the few writers
that I encountered in my searches who had even bothered to write about
anything like the issues with which I was beset, at least, in any terms
that I could understand or recognize as addressing the same perplexities.

Now you appear to be afflicted with a typical sort of myopia.
From what I have seen, it appears to be especially acute and
prevalent among intensional thinkers -- which is, by the way,
precisely one of the reasons why I am pursuing my extensional
remedies -- but I gather that it cannot be a genetic disorder
of that ilk, since Peirce hinself was adequately, if fallibly,
if not perfectly capable of deploying intensional methodology
to great effect.  So my working hypothesis for the present is
that it is rather more like an "occupational disease" (OD) of
the overly intensional worker.  The definitive sign among all
of its symptoms semes to be that the patient has a very great
difficulty lifting the mind's eye above the level of the lone
k-tuple of elementary relation that happens to be fixed right
in front of the mind's face.  Now, if you were so unfortunate
as to be the uniquely gifted sufferer of this condition, then
I should be bound to discuss it with you privately, but alas!
you are scarily any regent in your land of myopia but one who
has fallen under a widespread rule.  Thus it will continue to
serve the cause of general logical health if I continue in my
practice to treat the "less-mind" condition in public theatre.
Indeed, you should not feel so bad about this, because I have
observed many a one who knows adequately, if fallibly, if not
perfectly clearly how to e-nuniciate the phrase "Relations be
sets", but who, fora that, cannot e-numerate its consequences.
Namely, for starters, that the relation is not in the k-tuple,
the k-tuple is in the relation.  Until they can see that, and
see what it means, all the words in the web will not site 'em.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Jon,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Peirce's "mind-less" formal definitions are only
&gt; &gt; &gt; partially true because too abstract if they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to explain anything at all in practice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is dichotomous thinking.  The very way that you use
&gt; &gt; the term "mind-less" implies that a thing whose qualities
&gt; &gt; are independent of mind must therefore be exclusive of mind.
&gt; 
&gt; I meant by mind-less:  with no explicit reference to a mind.
&gt; The L75 definition of a sign is mind-less in the way that the
&gt; definition of a line is particle-less ("A definition of a sign
&gt; will be given which not more refers to human thought than does
&gt; the definition of a line as the place with a particle occupies,
&gt; part by part, during a lapse of time.")  But is there anything
&gt; new here really?

No, nothing remains but the fit reading of what is writ.
The reason, so I guess, why the geometric case is adduced,
is to call to mind the relation of mathematics to physics,
and thereby hangs both the point and the line of it.

&gt; &gt; Besides, definitions do not explain.  Explanations explain.

&gt; I know.  Formal definitions do not explain, but formal models do.

That is a function of their use.  It is not automatic writ.
So we have to examine the logic of abduction to clarify it.

&gt; However formal models directly derived from formal definitions
&gt; do not explain more than the definition themselves if they do
&gt; not add anything to it.

It is in their use, in their application, that we add a bit to them.

&gt; &gt; I keep saying what Peirce and the whole classical and scholastic
&gt; &gt; tradition before him kept saying, that logic and psychology are
&gt; &gt; independent sciences -- the same thing would go for any other
&gt; &gt; transverse pair of normative and descriptive sciences -- and
&gt; &gt; you just seem to keep hearing the words "mutually repellant"
&gt; &gt; instead of "independent".  I do not get this.  Independent
&gt; &gt; sciences can even cover the very same context of phenomena,
&gt; &gt; without thereby tripping over or getting in each other's way.

&gt; &gt;       Dimension Of Mind

&gt; &gt; &gt; The formal definition from L75 only describes the sign
&gt; &gt; &gt; as one of the correlates of a triadic relation, i.e.
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sign as a being for an other.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do not talk this way.  You just think this way.
&gt; &gt; I have said over [and over]* that the significance
&gt; &gt; of this particular definition is the way that it most
&gt; &gt; clearly defines the whole sign relation as the primary
&gt; &gt; subject of the definition, a relation in extension being
&gt; &gt; a set of triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;, etc, etc, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But a sign has in fact two beings:
&gt; &gt; &gt; its being for an other (the object)
&gt; &gt; &gt; and its own being.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And every father is a son, except possibly for the boundary
&gt; &gt; conditions at the beginning and the end of time.  So what?
&gt; 
&gt; Well it is what I thought:  you are reducing the sign to the "sign relation" ...

!?!?!?

&gt; and everything get so relative that you do not know where to begin.

The sign relation, a set of triples, is over and above
each of its triples and all of their component members.
We get nowhere by fixating on ISO-lated domain members
and trying to chase their pedigrees through the aviary.

The whole sign relation is the whole forma model of the moment,
and it is applied as a whole to capture an aspect of the whole
complex phenomenon of interest at the moment.  I keep writing
this.  It is just your OD of intensional myopia that prevents
you from being able to read what's written, and thus to think
what it means.

&gt; If the sign is destroyed, the sign relation is destroyed,
&gt; but conversely if the sign relation is destroyed a part
&gt; of the being of the sign subsists because its being is
&gt; twofold, what is left is a potential sign or an object
&gt; of experience that is not a sign of anything (being a
&gt; representative does not mean only being a representative.)

Again, you utterly confound the model with the object.
There's a double meaning in that, to wit, the modeling
relation itself is a "higher order" (HO) sign relation,
in particular, an iconic one.  That's a different story,
a very interesting one -- if we ever get past this primer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not an isolated entity because it belongs to a genuine triad,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but nevertheless its entire being is not completely swallowed by
&gt; &gt; &gt; the triadic relation either.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The entire being?  This is absolute essentialism again.
&gt; &gt; Being a sign at a particular moment is only one aspect
&gt; &gt; or the hypothetical "totality" of being of any entity.
&gt; &gt; Being a sign is a role of a being, not its essence.
&gt; &gt; Doesn't anybody just read anymore?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The nature of the sign is to exist in replicas (Cf. New Elements).

Yes, everybody uses all the words they know from time to time.  So?
I even use the words "essence" and "essential".  Do you imagine that
I mean exactly what others mean by them?  I suggest you imagine again.
But this is just your myopia again, beset in a textual contxt, always
trying to make sense of points of light without forming whole pictures.

&gt; In the first place, a sign is not a real thing.

Exactly.  Signhood is an abstract role.

&gt; It is of such a nature as to exist in replicas.

Exactly.  Abstractions are embodied in those concrete representatives
from which we imagine them to have been abstracted in the first place.

&gt; Look down a printed page, and every 'the' you see is the same word,
&gt; every 'e' the same letter.  A real thing does not so exist in replica.
&gt; The being of a sign is merely being represented.  Now really being and
&gt; being represented are very different.
&gt; 
&gt; What is usually call the "sign" is only the replica of it,
&gt; by forgetting that signs are more than their replica.
&gt; But what is a sign without replica?

An abstract role.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If the three elements (S, O, I) are of the nature of a sign, ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This becomes non-sense at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, being of the nature of a sign does not mean to be a sign.
&gt; The nature of a sign -- as an element of a genuine triadic relation --
&gt; is the same as the nature of the object and of the interpretant.
&gt; In the Lowell Lectures:

| 537.  Now in genuine Thirdness, the first, the second, and the third
| are all three of the nature of thirds, or thought, while in respect to
| one another they are first, second, and third.  The first is thought in
| its capacity as mere possibility;  that is, mere mind capable of thinking,
| or a mere vague idea.  The second is thought playing the role of a Secondness,
| or event.  That is, it is of the general nature of experience or information.
| The third is thought in its role as governing Secondness.  It brings the
| information into the mind, or determines the idea and gives it body.
| It is informing thought, or cognition.  But take away the
| psychological or accidental human element, and in this
| genuine Thirdness we see the operation of a sign.

Do you even read the stuff you quote?

Here's the thing:  Since I have read and understood the more
complete and explicit definitions of a sign relation, I can
recognize everything here as a particulat explication of it.
I just do not get the sense that you can easily do the reverse.

&gt; So in relation to the triad as a whole, they are of the same nature,
&gt; of the nature of thought, but respective to each other and according
&gt; to their role in the relation they have distinctive modes of being,
&gt; their nature is both different and identical at the same time
&gt; depending on how you look at it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; in that they take part in a triadic relation (Peirce writes
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the Lowell Lectures that they are of the nature of "thirds" ),
&gt; &gt; &gt; likewise, they have their own being, the interpretant has its own
&gt; &gt; &gt; being, the sign has its own being and the object has its own being.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All God's Chillun Got Their Own Being ...
&gt; &gt; That has little to do with being signs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So if you start from a formal definition that only refer
&gt; &gt; &gt; to a triadic relation and believe that you can explain ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's not an explanation --
&gt; &gt; It's only a description --
&gt; &gt; Please!  No wagering!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything from there, where each element is reduced to its mode of
&gt; &gt; &gt; being respective to the other correlates, then you are missing half
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the picture.  In asking "what is a sign?", do not simply answer
&gt; &gt; &gt; the question by saying how a sign enters in relation with the other
&gt; &gt; &gt; correlates, but ask yourself also what a sign in actu really is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; what is "an object of direct experience" like? and the object of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sign:  what is a "fragment of history" like? and finally what
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the interpretant, what is the determination of a mind?  Or you
&gt; &gt; &gt; have only walked half the road.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I do not think that you get what formal models are for.
&gt; &gt; They are not intent to exhaust the being or even meant
&gt; &gt; to exhaust the description of any real thing.  At best,
&gt; &gt; they capture something of importance about that thing,
&gt; &gt; enough to get by for a while.  There does not have to
&gt; &gt; be any confounded kind of gawd-aweful death-struggle
&gt; &gt; between formal and practical.  The choice of a formal
&gt; &gt; model is a practical decision.  Formal is beautiful
&gt; &gt; and beautiful is practical, like I done tole you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but if a formal model is too all-encompassing,
&gt; as a result of which some things become sign which
&gt; otherwise would not have been signs practically,
&gt; its usefulness is limited to theoretical
&gt; speculations detached from reality.

Look, I have used these concepts to design concrete data structures
and to implement running, effective, efficient programs that have
applications to complex logical problems and real-live data sets.
But that is because I know what I am talking about when I speak
of sign relations, and that makes all the difference.
