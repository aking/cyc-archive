Phil,

Right now, there is no "filter" for e-mail, which has some
benefits and some weaknesses.  The filter for "working papers"
would be the expectation that the submitters have spent some
time and effort to revise them to a more robust level.

When I suggested that the merged ontology have the number
SUO-WP-2001-001, the two leading zeroes on "001" indicate
that we should expect something less than 999 working papers
per year, but perhaps somewhat more than 100.  Right now,
we are getting more than 100 e-mails per week, and I would
hope that the WP archive would be much, much smaller than the
archive of e-mails.

&gt;A) Does SUO need some kind of "filter" to ensure that not just any document

&gt;can be submitted and automatically accepted as a working document / expert

&gt;contribution, and thereby gain the patina of preliminary status with IEEE
&gt;SUO?

If we ever get something that is truly a cranky submission,
we can take a vote to get rid of it.  I don't think that we
need to worry about that right now, judging from the people
who are already voting members or on the waiting list.
 
&gt;For example, suppose there is a "crank" who happens to be reading the
&gt;postings of this group, who would like to submit a document that virtually

&gt;everyone else would say is outlandish and not worth considering as a working

&gt;paper? Even under the additional terms proposed below, if Mr. Crank waits
&gt;six months and becomes a voting member, then he can submit a document and
&gt;tell the world it has been accepted as a working document by IEEE.

I don't believe that we should require votes for submitting
something as a working paper.  If and when something truly
cranky shows up, there will then be a flurry of e-mail that
should be sufficient to beat any reasonable submitter into
submission.  If the crank is not reasonable, then the SUO can
vote to delete the offending document at that time.

&gt;One
&gt;remedy for this (hopefully unlikely)potential problem is to require that
&gt;anything submitted for status as a working document must receive at least a

&gt;plurality of votes in favor of acceptance, by voting members of SUO.

Summary:  Keep the process simple.  Don't ask for a vote
unless the matter is something that requires a consensus.
And don't spend time worrying about unlikely occurrences that
can be handled by a simple vote when and if they ever occur.

John Sowa
