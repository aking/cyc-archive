&gt; Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; That's a good example.  It does indeed show that
&gt; I must add another condition to the definition of
&gt; what it means to be "proof preserving":
&gt; 
&gt; If a sentence s in language L1
&gt; is provable from some set A of
&gt; sentences in L1 (written A|-s)
&gt; and all sentences s and A can
&gt; be translated to language L2
&gt; by a meaning-preserving translation f,
&gt; then f(s) must be provable in L2 from
&gt; the translation f(A) of all sentences in A.
&gt; 
&gt; The following example wouldn't satisfy this condition:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let L1 = English (or a formalized subset thereof in order to apply (2))
&gt; &gt; Let L2 = English (or same formalized subset ...)
&gt; &gt; Let the transformation be the identity transformation except that 'left'
&gt; &gt; in L1 maps to 'right' in L2, and 'right' in L1 maps to 'left' in L2.
&gt; 
&gt; Just interchanging those two words would not satisfy all the
&gt; implications.  You would also have to reverse every possible
&gt; word or expression that might be used in any statement that
&gt; in any way involves the corresponding concepts.  For example,
&gt; consider the following three statements:
&gt; 
&gt;    - A solution of glucose in water rotates the plane of
&gt;      polarized light to the right.
&gt; 
&gt;    - A solution of fructose in water rotates the plane of
&gt;      polarized light to the left.
&gt; 
&gt;    - Fructose is sweeter than glucose.
&gt; 
&gt; If you switched the words "right" and "left", you would also
&gt; have to modify in some way every other word that might be
&gt; influenced by the switch.  And note that you couldn't just
&gt; switch the terms "glucose" and "fructose" without also
&gt; modifying other implications, such as sweetness.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, it is possible that there might be a true
&gt; looking-glass world, such as the one that Alice visited,
&gt; in which all the implications of all the related words are
&gt; modified appropriately.  But then, it would be reasonable
&gt; to say that switching the translations of f("right") and
&gt; f("left") would be appropriate for that world.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thinking about what happens not so rarely when translating into
&gt; &gt; English a sentence that was translated into French from English
&gt; &gt; (or any other pair of natural languages), it seems to me that one
&gt; &gt; can preserve meaning and yet have t3 not be a single term, but an
&gt; &gt; expression involving multiple terms that might be provably equivalent
&gt; &gt; to t1, but neither vocabulary preserving, even taking into account synonyms,
&gt; &gt; nor structure preserving.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I said "term" instead of "word" to include multi-word terms
&gt; in any particular language.  But when you go from L1 to L2, there
&gt; might be major transformations, such as the modifications that occur
&gt; when you go from CGs to KIF or to controlled natural languages.  But
&gt; those changes do not violate the condition I called "structure preserving",
&gt; which only involves the nesting of negations and quantifiers.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, consider the translation of "A cat on a mat"
&gt; from CGs to KIF:
&gt; 
&gt;    [Cat]-&gt;(On)-&gt;[Mat]
&gt; 
&gt; becomes
&gt; 
&gt;    (exists (?x ?y)
&gt;        (and (cat ?x) (mat ?y) (on ?x ?y)))
&gt; 
&gt; In one sense, the structure of KIF and CGs looks very different,
&gt; but in the sense I defined (which only considers quantifiers
&gt; and negations) the structure has not changed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; To use Jon's terminology, shoudn't &lt;o,s,i&gt; appear somewhere?
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to avoid any reference to the actual objects in
&gt; the universe of discourse because I wanted to define the
&gt; conditions on the translations in purely syntactic terms.
&gt; That restriction makes the conditions easy to check by
&gt; an efficiently computable algorithm.

John, Mark, ...

I have spent my idle hours the last couple of days
trying to come up with terminological work-arounds
for this general subject area, as I think that it
will deserve a diverse development with extended
ramifications.  Not much dust has settled yet,
but John's remarks in this note would appear
to help me reduce the problem quite a bit.

Just to acquaint you with my extremely tentative thoughts so far:

I had decided, most graciously, I thought, to permit
the words "meaning" and "proposition" to go on being
used in all of those ambiguous and equivocal manners
that appear to be their eternal lot among humankind,
for my part resorting, if need be, to these tactics:

1.  A panoply of devices like "Meaning:Con" and Meaning:Den" for the
    connotative meanings and the denotative meanings, respectively --
    where "connotative" means:den any meaning that is not denotative.

2.  A motley array of hedge-guards like "Prop:Obj" and "Prop:Sig" for the
    proposition as an abstract object and the proposition as a concrete sign,
    respectively.

This last punctillo spun me into an extended reflection, so far inconclusive,
on whether, in speaking of "abstract object" and "concrete sign", I had not
created a confound between the dimension marked by "abstract" and "concrete",
which seems to be very nearly continuous, and the dimension marked by the
terms "object" and "sign", which seems to be, in contrast, discrete.
Well, to make a short story incomplete, I will not divert you any
further with my other thoughts on these topics until such time as
they arrive at some point, or at least the sense of an ending.

However, John's clarifications here allow me, perhaps,
subject to approval, of course, to resolve the issue
rather more quickly, by redubbing what I am after
as "object preserving transformations" (OPT's),
and so that is what I will opt for next.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
