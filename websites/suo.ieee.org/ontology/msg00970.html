Dear Matthew,

Please see comments below.

&gt; &gt; PJ: I think that "understandability" should be a criterion in
&gt; &gt; selecting a
&gt; &gt; language, though it is subjective...People tend to like what they've
&gt; &gt; developed or already learned...
&gt;
&gt; MW: However, if we are to be successful inth elong run, we have
&gt; to make what
&gt; we are doing accessible. Graham has talked much about using ACE, or a
&gt; restricted form of ACE as one notation for the SUO.

PJ: Yes. The understandability issue for a formal language like KIF or EXIST
is the "learning curve" for newcomers to the language to understand it. ACE
seems to provide a very good route toward addressing understandability, so
another question is how easily can ACE map to a candidate formal language
like KIF or EXIST. So far, I do not sense that this is a major problem for
ACE, KIF, or EXIST..(?)


&gt; &gt; PJ: This reminds me of the issue that is often discussed
&gt; &gt; regarding the ease
&gt; &gt; of understandability and expressiveness of predicate calculus
&gt; &gt; vs. natural
&gt; &gt; language -- In particular, John Sowa has written about this issue in
&gt; &gt; comparing predicate calculus vs. conceptual graphs... It
&gt; &gt; seems possible that
&gt; &gt; the same kinds of arguments might translate to KIF (with the
&gt; &gt; same kinds of
&gt; &gt; rebuttals)...(?) This may be a way to address the
&gt; &gt; understandability and
&gt; &gt; expressiveness question...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; MW: Well there is another issue here, and that is that CG's have a
&gt; linguistic bias, which presupposes something of the nature of the ontology
&gt; you are going to create. Of course EXIST does the same thing with a
&gt; different bias.

PJ: Yes, which gets back to the question of what kinds of ontological
commitments are embedded  in the language that is chosen to express the
ontology...It would be interesting to compare and contrast KIF, EXIST, CG's,
etc. in terms of ontological commitments that they make...Perhaps someone
has already performed some of these comparisons?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: So yes EXIST could make a good starting point for the
&gt; &gt; SUO. However, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; find here an assumption that KIF is the starting point, and I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; considered it unwise for a newcomer like me to challenge this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PJ: Hmmm....I think it is generally wise at the outset of a
&gt; &gt; great endeavor
&gt; &gt; to question all assumptions...
&gt;
&gt; MW: I think I have done (more than) my share of questioning here.

PJ: No doubt, and I intend no criticism of you or anyone, except perhaps
myself. Perhaps I should have been asking questions and challenging
assumptions earlier...though I would be perceived (somewhat correctly) as
even more of a newcomer to the field of ontology... I guess my point is that
it is never too late to ask questions and challenge assumptions...

[...]
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Most of the objections I have been raising to our
&gt; &gt; current course are
&gt; &gt; &gt; based on this experience. I know exactly where we are
&gt; &gt; currently headed -
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PJ: Can you summarize from your perspectives, what mistakes
&gt; &gt; are currently
&gt; &gt; being made by SUO (or towards which SUO is headed) and what you would
&gt; &gt; recommend to address them?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; MW: The main lesson is that there are no short cuts, only diversions and
&gt; dead ends.

PJ: "There is no royal road to geometry". We should avoid taking paths just
on the basis that they appear to be shortcuts toward reaching our goals...A
corollary is that adopting any existing ontology (or language) just on the
basis that it will advance us more quickly toward SUO could be a mistake --
whatever existing ontologies or languages are chosen should be examined
critically relative to requirements, theoretical limitations, etc. -- and we
should not avoid defining our requirements...

PJ: Is SUO currently embarked on any paths that you recognize as diversions
or dead ends?
