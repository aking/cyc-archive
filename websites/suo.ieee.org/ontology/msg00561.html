John (et al.)

I have a couple of problems with your answer(s).

You seem to be suggesting that we 
(1)	do not examine the philosophical issues but 
(2)	adopt a position of naïve realism within which we can answer all the
questions we need to.

It seems to me that there is an element of schizophrenia in point (1) as you
quite explicitly take Peirce's philosophical work as your starting point
(basis).

GH&gt;	I feel you may be taking John at odds with what he was intending. Of
course you are correct in the pure sense, but, despite Descartes, there is
an ordinary approach of taking the world as we find it, and with a logical
framework based on the sort of common sense that underpins the discipline of
engineering. 

As to point (2) - you say "As soon as you ask that question, you open
Pandora's box of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
realists can talk together quite happily as long as they use ordinary
language for everyday life.  They can also work together quite happily as
long as they use mathematics and other formalized languages, such as KIF,
SQL, FORTRAN, C, Java, etc."

My experience is very different. When I see people trying and build
structures such as the SUO, one of the interesting observations is that
there is no consensus to take advantage of. No intuitive framework that can
be consistently specified. And that it is extremely difficult to discuss the
problems they encounter - or describe the results of their analysis - using
just ordinary language without some kind of philosophical intuition. Matthew
West's experience formalizing engineering data is one good example of this.
Look at the latest SWIFT standards for another. We find ourselves coming up
against the sort of problems that philosophers discuss (as we have done
here). And we need the kind of answers they give to tidy up our framework.
The nub of the problem seems to me that "SQL, FORTRAN, C, Java, etc" are not
going to answer the problems by themselves.

GH&gt;	I admit, that on joining this group, I have come across a
frustrating diversity of approaches to the world and how it should be
viewed. This saddens me greatly, though I have come across this situation
before in other fora. I guess this makes me want to stick with those who,
like myself have actually designed and/or developed things - both
conceptual, such as analytical, knowledge-based and/or decision-making
software; and concrete, such as aircraft, bridges, computer chips and
vaccines. Even those who are prepared to make an even fist of such a task.
Such people have demonstrated an ability to apply a workable paradigm to
achieve practical results, or at least a preparedness to sincerely try. 

The fact that philosophers have not agreed on the nature of the world does
not automatically make their input worthless. Any more than that theoretical
physicists have not agreed on the nature of the world. Philosophy has
provided analyses of several important areas - which we can usefully pick
up. We might not want to take advantage of their latest theories - just as
construction engineers do not take advantage of the latest physical
theories. But, it seems to me that provided we are sensible about what we
take, we are going to get a much better job taking a useful philosophical
analysis than trying to recreate it with a fraction of the resources and
experience.

GH&gt;	I also don't want to discard the valuable insights of philosophers
etc. But there is one basic aspect that is key to our task. We are
attempting to develop a standard. This means that what we produce should be
able to be: 
*	understood by any person of reasonable intelligence who is prepared
to read the standard (along with any reference documents - mainly other
standards); and 
*	applied by such a person to produce actual product based on, and
fully conformant with, it. 

GH&gt;	In my experience, when standards are developed in new fields of
endeavour, there are typically resistance from practitioners of the day.
This seems to especially to areas where qualification is based on tertiary
education, especially university. My impressions are that such people feel
both that: 
*	their field has some inherently obscure properties that can only be
comprehended by those who have gone through the rites of initiation of the
guild to which they belong - usually the relevant university degree; and 
*	their status as being beyond ordinary folk would be threatened by
allowing such people to attempt to take on the work themselves, given the
appropriate guidance literature - I have been through this experience
myself, so it isn't just me being superior. 

GH&gt;	This puts standards and their development at odds with exclusivism /
élitism. 

One unpalatable result may be that people who want to build something like
an SUO will need to acquire a working knowledge of some of the philosophical
results. While this might seem like hard work - it is a lot easier in the
long run than trying to recreate the results by oneself. 

GH&gt;	Speaking for myself, I know I understand something when I can
precisely describe it in my own words in a way that the cognoscenti agree is
accurate, yet without me having to omit issues that seem relevant to me. In
essence, this is when I have, at least mentally, recreated the results
myself, and from basics. A recent example is our attempt to define
"relation" and "relationship". At this stage the experts have not
satisfactorily answered issues I have raised about different cardinalities
of relationships, and there are also currently some gaps in the definitional
framework proposed for them. 

GH&gt;	I suggest that when we have the basic terms comprehensively
explained in simple and unambiguous words and sentences, we will have a
chance of making progress. This is because we will be actually forced to
have defined all the logical consequences of each aspect of the meanings of
the terms and the applications for which they will be used. 

GH&gt;	Perhaps our big mistake is that we haven't started by agreeing on
the definitions of terms? I don't know. 



Regards
Chris

Matthew, Mike, et al.,

That is a very serious and very difficult question:

&gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call
&gt;what it is in the real world that they refer to?

As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box of metaphysical
problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and realists can talk together quite
happily as long as they use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can
also work together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and other
formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C, Java, etc.

But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they refer to in the
real world?" all hell breaks loose.

You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?

Suggestion:

 1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
    interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
    satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
    is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.

 2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
    purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
    realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
    words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
    let's not worry too much about what it is.

 3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
    the position that KIF is the official language to be used
    for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
    If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.

I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out" that
doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the same cop out that
Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his Tractatus:  "Everything that
can be said can be said clearly, and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we
must be silent."

For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some extra
prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in the SUO] can be
said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot speak [in KIF], thereof we must
be silent.

This is not an answer to the question of what do relations really refer to.
It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the only kind of cop out that will
allow us to get some work done.

John Sowa
