Formalism Engineering

BA = Bill Andersen
JA = Jon Awbrey
JS = John Sowa

JS: Before commenting on the recent discussion,
    I'd like to quote the first paragraph from
    Chapter 3 of a great textbook on knowledge
    representation:

JS: | Knowledge engineering is the application of logic and ontology
    | to the task of building computable models of some domain for
    | some purpose.  The features computable, domain, and purpose
    | characterize it as a branch of engineering.
    |
    | Pure mathematics lacks all three:  it need not have an application domain;
    | it may define noncomputable or even infinite structures;  and it may have
    | no purpose other than the esthetic satisfaction of contemplating elegant
    | abstractions.
    |
    | Empirical sciences have a domain, and they make computable predictions
    | about the domain;  but they need not have any purpose other than the
    | pursuit of knowledge.
    |
    | Engineering, however, uses science and mathematics for the purpose
    | of solving practical problems within the constraints of budgets
    | and deadlines.  Knowledge engineering can therefore be defined
    | as the branch of engineering that analyzes knowledge about
    | some subject and transforms it to a computable form for
    | some purpose.

That is indeed a bon summa!  A good discussion of its points
could exercise us well into the summer and onto the next fall.
Sadly, that cannot happen in the main SUO forum.  It wouldn't be
possible to avoid mentioning the dreaded name of &quot;Peirce&quot; and then
there would be more screaming -- at the very idea that knowledge does
not automatically, eternally, inexorably march uniformly forward, never
missing a beat, never looking back at what is past and forever passed over.
Indeed, it would commit us to undertaking a critical examination under the
heading of &quot;What is knowledge that a mortal may engineer it?&quot; (WIKTAMMEI?)

But that would knee-jerkedly be classified
under &quot;epistemology&quot;, &quot;inquiry&quot;, &quot;science&quot;,
or &quot;fuzzy-headed-process-thinking-ology&quot;,
and immediately be declared &quot;off-topic&quot;.
For those already possessed of a perfect
knowledge of being, what is the good of
discussing how they came to possess it?

From what I've seen so far of the &quot;Common Logic&quot; draft,
there are many important issues of a related character
that need to be carefully addressed there, too, but
I do not know where such a discussion could occur,
and especially if nobody wants to talk about it.

JS: Note the three features that distinguish engineering from science:

    (1) purpose,

    (2) solving practical problems,

    (3) constraints of budgets and deadlines
        (or more generally, available resources).

Yes, maybe, maybe even according to some of the &quot;received accounts&quot; of science,
but here I would have to differ on almost every point, and I have long thought
of my view as &quot;pragmatic&quot;, if it were not for the fact that there is trouble
in the heart of pragmatic thinking as to the proper relationship of practice
and theory to one another.  Another long inquiry begins here, one that I have
found is far too upsetting to even the disciples of Peirce to be continued in
their &quot;open&quot; forums.

JA: What is &quot;formalism engineering&quot; if not
    the critique of existing formalisms and
    the art of designing them more to the
    point of their transcendental purposes?

JS: I suppose that a transcendental purpose is a purpose, but I'm
    not sure how or whether it is related to practical problems.
    And this definition leaves out the constraint of available
    resources.  So I would not consider this to be an adequate
    definition of anything that purports to be a branch of
    engineering.

When I wrote this I thought that it was a simple heuristic truism --
it wasn't meant to be definitive or exhaustive or anything, just a
rough guideline.  When we have an objective, a purpose, a &quot;pragma&quot;,
and we try something toward it, and then we succeed in some measure,
and we usually fall short in some measure, well, the objective still
remains -- maybe that makes it &quot;immanent&quot; instead of &quot;transcendent&quot;,
but that wasn't the particular philosophy that I had in mind -- I was
thinking of the way that the pragma is out there beyond our various and
sundry approximations to it, like approximations to the natural log base, e.

JS: In criticizing Jon's definition, Bill Andersen wrote:

BA: That's SCIENCE, not ENGINEERING ...

BA: For the purposes of building an ontology system (or systems),
    there is only one necessary condition:  that the logic be able
    to do any computation we can do on our current von Neumann-style
    digital computers.

JS: This criticism gets closer to the problems of engineering,
    since it mentions the purpose of building something that
    does at least as much as current (i.e., practical) systems.
    And the implicit assumption is that it could do the same or
    similar tasks better (i.e., with fewer resources or a closer
    approximation to the desired goal).

JS: I believe, however, that Jon's search for some minimal essence
    of what logic is supposed to be does have merit.  In my opinion,
    Peirce's existential graphs come very close to that ideal.

Well, &quot;minimalism&quot;, maybe, on alternate days, as long as folks know
the difference between that and &quot;reductionism&quot;.  But &quot;essentialist&quot;
or &quot;anti-essentialist&quot; am I neither.

The sense of the word &quot;minimal&quot; that comes to mind is the term
that we used to employ in applied data base management and also
in decision support systems -- &quot;minimal adequate dataset&quot; (MAD).
Like the MAD for a personal medical record or the MAD for some
suite of applied research questions, like the MAD for what to do
about &quot;the incidence of low birthweight babies in population X&quot;,
or &quot;the cognitive and social deficits among abandoned children&quot;,
airy fairy stuff like that.  That is the sort of stuff that the
rest of the world is busy doing with the tools that we deign to
dispense them every now and then from our precious think tanks.

JS: However, an ideal engineering solution may have many more features
    than the minimum.  After an ideal set of primitives has been found,
    it may be convenient to combine those primitives to define new
    operators that simplify the expression of various propositions.

JS: Bottom line:  I wouldn't call Jon's search for minimalism
    to be a branch of engineering, but a scientific endeavor
    that might someday contribute to an engineering effort.
    Bill's emphasis on getting something accomplished on
    a timely schedule seems to be closer to the essence
    of engineering.

I'm supposed to google up at this point a nice video of that bridge
that boogied itself to death, but I have temporarily forgotten the
name of it, still, it's not like it's some kind of unique disaster,
where a billion or a trillion was lost on &quot;just in time&quot; engineering,
or where seven died for the sake of such a &quot;dead line&quot;.  Not my line.

Jon Awbrey
