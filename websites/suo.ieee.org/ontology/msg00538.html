&gt; &gt; 	.	While I appreciate your contributions, I can't follow about

&gt; &gt; probably get much more support for your approaches if you were. 


I have sent private E-mail to Jon making a similar request: just use simpler language when practicable.  There is no need to be cutesy (or poetic or anything else).  English isn't the native language for some people on this list, so being cutesy doesn't help convey the message or build standards ... and it doesn't help us understand the points that Jon is really trying to make (I've read some of his other writings ... when he writes non-cutesy, he is much easier to understand).

The following is one of many examples from Jon.  Notice that ***each line has the same number of characters*** (see lines below marked with a "#" character).  That's all fun and good if you want to create crossword puzzles for everyone.  But it makes it much harder to understand what is really being said.  In other words, is it really more important to restructure/contort each sentence so that every line has the same number of characters?  Or is it more important to communicate simply and clearly?

I would really like to have a better understanding of Jon's points.  I'm sure others, too, would like to appreciate Jon's thoughts.  Let's just use simpler language when practicable.

Arisbeans, Resourcerors, SemioComrades, Stand Up Ontologists,

| Why is it necessary to reflect on signs?
| Why not just talk about the objects alone?
| Why not just use signs without mentioning them?

I cannot get together a sufficient amount of concentration
to even think of dealing with these questions in any kind
of a systematic way right now, but I keep being reminded
of them by the bits and snatches of commentary that I am
able to scan on our various lists, so maybe I can try to
chip away at them as I see the different aspects of the
problem come up.

# One thing that my conversation with Matthew brought back to mind
# was this old but persistent observation of mine that we actually
# make use of set theory in radically different ways, depending on
# whether it happens to be sets of objects, in general, or sets of
# signs, as a special case, on which we are focussed at the moment
# in question.

# As for sets of objects in general, being human, we are really greedy,
# and we tend to chafe at any sorts of prior constraints that might be
# laid on what we have the power to encompass by our surveys of things.

# As for sets of signs in that role, being human, we have finite powers
# to control, to determine, to discern, to fashion, and to resolve them,
# and so what I have in mind here is the sorts of bounds that we accept
# in the computational sciences, in contra-distinction from mathematics,
# where our imagination knows no bounds, comparatively speaking, anyway.
# Here, if we want to be practical, we constrain the sets of signs that
# we adopt to the "finitely generated" varieties, like formal languages
# that are au fond founded on a finite alphabet, lexicon, or vocabulary.

# It was this "differential deployment" of set theory that I had in mind
# a while ago when I quoted this observation of a founder of the subject:

| That the word "set" is being used indiscriminately
| for completely different notions and that this is
| the source of the apparent paradoxes of this young
| branch of science, that, moreover, set theory itself
| can no more dispense with axiomatic assumptions than
| can any other exact science and that these assumptions,
| just as in other disciplines, are subject to a certain
| arbitrariness, even if they lie much deeper here --
| I do not want to represent any of this as something new.
|
| ~~ Julius König, 1905

# Well, I do not want to represent it as anything new, either --
# far less so now! -- and I do not believe that the situation
# with set theory has changed all that much since the days of
# this subject's first dawn, except for a dubious distinction
# that the glory of the theory has made us forget how to make
# such easy and obvious and simple observations.

# So what!?  So I reckon that our failure to distinguish just
# which column of the sign-theoretic ledger that we are using
# our set theories "to make book on" or "to keep accounts by",
# is one of the things that is currently causing the greatest
# number of failures to communicate in several of the present
# discussion groups.  And I think that a modicum of attention
# to this "pragmatic" factor, dealing with how the set theory
# is being set, with what aim, on what basis, in what context,
# and so on, might just permit us to untangle a few old knots.
