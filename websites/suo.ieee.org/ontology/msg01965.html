Pat, Jon, et al.,

This confusion of terminology is inevitable in any project,
report, or standard that involves multidisciplinary 
collaboration.

PH&gt;Sorry, we are getting our communication wires crossed by a pun on 
&gt;"class". Mathematicians use the word in a very particular way, which 
&gt;in its full form is written "proper class", to refer to things that 
&gt;anyone but a mathematican (and even some of them) would call a set, 
&gt;except they are so big that if they are accepted into the 
&gt;set-theoretic universe they would give rise to paradoxes.

This use is known only to the subgroup of mathematicians who
are working on logic and foundations.  Working mathematicians
in algebra, topology, differential equations, etc., may be
aware of the term, but they almost never use improper classes.

&gt; In the 
&gt;wider word, however, the term "class" is used in a sense which is 
&gt;closely linked to "classification", to refer to (the extension of) a 
&gt;named category in some kind of classification heirarchy. Such classes 
&gt;all have sets as their extension (or, maybe, ARE sets), but not every 
&gt;set would normally be dignified with the title of 'class(ification)'

This is another common use.  But in the programming language
community (which now includes almost every computer science
major and almost everybody who has ever used or heard about
object-oriented programming languages) a class has a very
specific meaning:  it is a kind of data type that has
associated methods.

&gt;Im afraid that this sense of 'class' has already been in widespread 
&gt;use throughout at least one of the broader technical ontology 
&gt;communities for about a decade now. Check out the literature on 
&gt;description logics and such ontological 'standards' as LOOM and 
&gt;CLASSIC.

Essentially all AI languages, from LISP and Prolog to LOOM,
Classic, CLIPS, etc., are almost unknown among the overwhelming
majority of programmers in the world.  For computer science
majors and working programmers today, a class is a data type
with methods.

When you have a word, such as "class", with so many different
meanings to so many different people who are potential users
of the SUO, I believe that it is tainted beyond all usefulness.

Recommendation:

 1. Use the word "set" in its purely extensional sense, as
    in "naive" set theory and its more axiomatized versions.

 2. Do not use the word "class" as a technical word in KIF
    or the SUO.     

 3. Select some term from the set {"type", "sort", "category"),
    and use it for both the KIF sorts and the things in the
    SUO hierarchy.

 4. Define a denotation operator, which for any domain of
    discourse, maps the things in point #3 to sets.

 5. Avoid making a commitment whether the things mentioned
    in point #3 are or are not identical to their denotations,
    since we may want to talk about multiple universes or
    domains of discourse at some time in the future.
