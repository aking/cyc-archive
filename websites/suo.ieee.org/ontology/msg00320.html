&gt;Pat,
&gt;	.	Comments interspersed, prefaced "GH&gt;	".
&gt;
&gt;	.	I have a more involved structure in mind than is necessarily
&gt;evident in any particular communication.
&gt;

OK, fair enough.

&gt;Subject:	RE: SUO: Core Meanings and the SUO
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Douglas,
&gt; &gt;	.		Why should what you are saying necessarily be so?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	To me you are addressing the matter that, often, people
&gt; &gt;don't precisely define their utterances, with the result that the
&gt; &gt;information interpreted doesn't always match that uttered. But, that
&gt; &gt;doesn't mean that everyone is as ambiguous as everyone else, nor
&gt; &gt;that ambiguity is unavoidable if sufficient care is expended to be
&gt; &gt;precise.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	Leaving out all sorts of issues of freedom for people to
&gt; &gt;express themselves as they wish, including as ambiguously as
&gt; &gt;they like, why will not the precision of computer languages serve
&gt; &gt;to achieve unambiguity? Allowing for the severely restricted
&gt; &gt;vocabulary, if I communicate to you in a computer language in
&gt; &gt;which you are literate, surely you will understand precisely what I
&gt; &gt;say?
&gt;
&gt;No, you won't. When was the last time you actually READ code, instead of
&gt;running it?
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;	In view of your tone, how about you guess first?

Sorry if I got a little too ad hominem there. I meant only that one 
tends to run software which others send to one, rather than read it. 
Well, most of us do.

&gt;You might also care
&gt;to speculate about what I have conceived and developed with it also.

I forbear to speculate about other peoples personal lives. Maybe you 
eat Microsoft CDs for breakfast, I don't know.

&gt;PH&gt; But theres a deeper misunderstanding here. When you say 
&gt;'computer language'
&gt;do you mean 'programming language' (which is only even called a 'language'
&gt;by a kind of extension from normal usage) or do you mean 'language for
&gt;expressing meanings which is stored in a computer' ?
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;	Whether it's one or the other makes very little conceptual
&gt;difference. The concept is that each element has a precisely defined
&gt;interpretation. Note that I did NOT say "a precisely defined
&gt;implementation".

No, I hear the difference, but I still think you are wrong. A formal 
ontology language DOESNT provide a precise, unambiguous meaning for 
all its terms. (In fact, one can often prove quite rigorously that a 
truly unambiguous meaning is impossible to achieve using any of a 
wide class of formal logics, using some variation of Godel's theorem. 
)

There is a notable contrast here between logics and programming 
languages, and it comes out clearly in their formal semantic 
theories. Programming language semantics typically relies on the 
recursion theorem to guarantee the existence of *unique* minimal 
fixedpoints of recursive constructions. Ontology languages are 
usually not even able to express finiteness unambiguously, and the 
second recursion theorem doesnt apply to assertional logics, in 
general. This is the price they pay for having a semantics which 
claims to be able to talk about anything, not just the things that 
can be finitely constructed by mechanaical opoerations inside 
computing engines.

&gt;There is nothing particularly *computerish* about an ontology language; or
&gt;if there is, that aspect of it adds nothing to its conceptual or ontological
&gt;clarity or precision.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;	Well, we agree on that one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	If we start from this sort of basis, and I don't care
&gt; &gt;whether it's using a "CE" or "KIF", then why won't we achieve
&gt; &gt;unambiguous communication?
&gt;
&gt;Because KIF and CE only specify the logical framework within which the
&gt;ontological meanings are to be expressed, not those meanings themselves. Not
&gt;that this is to be sneezed at, I hasten to add; but it isnt a magical
&gt;guarantee against misunderstanding.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt; 	Yes, you've picked me up validly here. I should have said: ".....
&gt;then why won't we be able to achieve unambiguous communication?"

It depends what you mean by 'unambiguous'. I think maybe we will be 
able to achieve workable communication, just as human beings do all 
the time; which really means something like, we havnt found anything 
to disagree about yet. But that kind of 'unambiguous' communication 
always has to be open to further negotiation in order to resolve 
misunderstandings which might only surface later.  If you really mean 
full semantic unambiguity, which would be in model-theoretic terms 
there being a unique model, then one can prove that this is almost 
always unobtainable. Just having us both use Peano arithmetic is 
enough to guarantee that this couldnt be possible.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;	.	I admit, that when it comes to expressing complex
&gt; &gt;and/or sophisticated concepts, then the communication will require:
&gt; &gt;*	prefacing with some assumed structure (eg. possibly the
&gt; &gt;concept that anger arises out of fear); and
&gt; &gt;*	a great deal of elaboration to ensure every aspect is defined.
&gt;
&gt;You should read Quine on the indeterminacy of translation, and then see if
&gt;you are still so confident that this 'great deal of elaboration' is always
&gt;going to work.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt; 	My statement may have to be read in light of some of my previous
&gt;contributions. If one starts with a small and precisely defined structure,
&gt;then one can be precise within the scope of that structure.

But then how is the structure itself communicated? (Of course, if we 
assume that our ideas are sufficiently well aligne before we start 
communicating, then we can communicate arbitrarily well.)

&gt;GH&gt; 	I am NOT saying any language will be able to achieve perfect
&gt;unambiguous communication in all circumstances. As the breadth of coverage
&gt;extends, it will periodically be necessary to amend particular terms, and
&gt;even, from time to time, conceptual structures.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt; 	The advance of humanity and technology have repeatedly involved this
&gt;sort of mechanism throughout history. For example, the Earth used to be seen
&gt;as the centre of the Universe. Later this status was accorded the Sun. More
&gt;recently the conceptual structure had to change yet more.

Yes, and these changes are often described as 'scientific 
revolutions', for a good reason. They involve destroying the old 
foundations and starting over, a long and painful process usually 
taking more than one human generation.

&gt;GH&gt; 	However, I am suggesting that a basic structure can be developed to
&gt;have "meta-" elements that allow extrapolation to cover quite a range of
&gt;matters, provided the extrapolation is done in a carefully structured way.

Maybe. That "meta-" idea is certainly a universal hope. We plan to 
have a meta-extension to SUO-KIF which will be able in principle to 
describe any syntactic mapping. But syntax isnt really the hard issue 
here, of course.
.....

&gt;GH&gt; 	Regardless of what language we use, the same aspects will apply. Jon
&gt;Awbrey has been trying to warn us of this aspect throughout the project.
&gt;Using KIF does not avoid the problem you are raising.

Oh, indeed not. KIF doesnt really solve any ontological problems at 
all; its just a language.
