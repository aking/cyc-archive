Hi All,

	Below is my response to Pat Hayes' criticism.  It does repeat some
points that I've made in earlier postings, but I thought it would be
worthwhile to try to collect these points into a single reply.

&gt; WG
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I vote NO.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments: I don't mean to denigrate Niles' hard work, but it is 
&gt; ridiculously premature to adopt this (or anything else like this) as 
&gt; a base document. This document doesnt even come close to the 
&gt; requirement for a base document given in the accompanying text:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;base document: Starting point for standards words (it's 
&gt; clear the document
&gt; &gt;*can* be transformed into standards words).
&gt; 
&gt; It has no overall coherent ontological model; it represents a melange 
&gt; of conflicting and incommensurate views on many basic ontological 
&gt; issues. Its axioms have no global coherence (for example: the 
&gt; intended meaning of the quantifiers varies from one place to another 
&gt; in the document; later axioms do not conform to the categories 
&gt; introduced in the earlier axioms; many, if not most, of the major 
&gt; classifications depend on questionable and controversial philosphical 
&gt; presuppositions.) It fails to address many of the basic ontological 
&gt; issues that ned to be got clear before we can put any ontology to 
&gt; practical use (how to represent time and change, how to deal with 
&gt; alternative courses of reality, for example. ) Moreover, it is clear 
&gt; that the more 'pieces' are added to it, the more these problems are 
&gt; going to get worse rather than better.
&gt; 
&gt; This methodology is fundamentally flawed. There is no way to achieve 
&gt; a coherent ontology by 'merging' axioms from incommensurate 
&gt; ontological perspectives in this simplistic way. It is rather like 
&gt; trying to create  a large piece of software by just adjoining pieces 
&gt; of code written by different authors in different computer languages, 
&gt; and expecting it to magically work.
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from the general issues of a lack of a coherent methodology, I 
&gt; have many particular problems with much of the actual content of the 
&gt; document. As it stands, the ontology it outlines would be unworkable 
&gt; for me for almost any practical purpose, even if it were globally 
&gt; coherent. But this is not the right place to go into details.

&gt; 
&gt; 

I agree that a methodology of simply adjoining concepts and axioms from
disparate sources would be fundamentally flawed.  However, this is not what
I tried to do.  I attempted to integrate the axioms/subsumption
relationships of various ontologies into the same stock of concepts (taken
from a simplified version of John Sowa's upper-level ontology).  In detail,
the procedure I used is as follows.  The first step was to convert all of
the ontologies listed on the SUO Candidate Content web page
(<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>) into SUO-KIF.  Once this was
accomplished, I selected the most general ontology (John Sowa's upper level
ontology) as the base ontology.  I then mapped concepts/axioms from the
remaining ontologies into the base ontology.  In this mapping process, there
were two possible cases, each in turn with two subcases.

1.  New content (Nothing in the merged ontology corresponds with the
concept/axiom to be mapped)

  	a. Useful/Relatively Noncontroversial content.  In this subcase, the
new concept/axiom is deemed to 	be useful and not to violate any cherished
philosophical principles.  Once I decided that the new 	concept/axiom should
be included, it was simply a matter of finding a place for it in the
ontology.  	In some cases, this required creating some intermediate
levels of concepts between existing 	concepts and new content.  These
intermediate levels were identified in an earlier email directed 	at
John Sowa on "trouble spots" in the merged ontology.  An example of this
subcase is the 	subhierarchy of numbers that was taken from the KIF-Numbers
ontology on the Ontolingua server. 

	(subclass-of RealNumber Number)
	(subclass-of RationalNumber RealNumber)
	(subclass-of PositiveRealNumber RealNumber)
	(subclass-of NegativeRealNumber RealNumber)
	(subclass-of Integer RationalNumber)
	(subclass-of EvenInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of OddInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of NaturalNumber Integer)
	(subclass-of NonnegativeInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of NegativeInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of PositiveInteger Integer)
	(subclass-of PositiveNumber Number)
	(subclass-of NegativeNumber Number)
	(subclass-of ComplexNumber Number) 

	b. Useless/Controversial content.  In this subcase, the new
concept/axiom is judged (by me) to be 	either not useful or too
controversial for incorporation into a schema that we hope will have both
broad application and wide acceptance.  This is of course a very subjective
judgement, but ontology 	merging/alignment is probably much more of
an art than a science.  An example of content that was 	thought to be too
controversial for inclusion is the following hierarchy of normative notions
developed by myself.  It is too controversial, because there are many ways
of categorizing such 	notions, and some have suggested that a version of
Deontic Logic would be more appropriate for 	capturing the required
connections.

	;; (subclass-of Normative Entity)
	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Normative)
	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Proposition)
	;; (subclass-of Obligation NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of Agreement NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of JudgementOfEtiquette NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of AestheticJudgement NormativeProposition)
	;; (subclass-of InstitutionalObligation Obligation)
	;; (subclass-of PersonalObligation Obligation)
	;; (subclass-of ReligiousObligation InstitutionalObligation)
	;; (subclass-of LegalObligation InstitutionalObligation)

2.  Old Content (There is some degree of overlap between the merged ontology
and the concept/axiom to be     mapped)

	a.  Perfect Overlap.  In this case, the terms may differ but the new
concept has the same semantic 	content as a concept already in the merged
ontology or, with respect to axioms, there is a logical 	equivalence
between the new axiom and an existing axiom.  An example of this sort of
case occurs in 	the various mereotopological theories.  Some philosophers
use 'part-of' as the primitive notion to 	frame their axioms, some use
'overlaps', and still others use some notion of 'connection'.  	However, in
many cases, axioms across these different systems are logically equivalent.

	b.  Partial Overlap.  In this case, there is some overlap in meaning
between the new content and 	existing concepts or axioms in the merged
ontology.  An example of this is the case role hierarchy.  	Although
John Sowa's system of case roles was part of the base ontology (and, hence,
the original 	merged ontology), I tried to simplify it somewhat to make it
more like other systems of case roles.  	Both systems follow:

	John Sowa's Subhierarchy under 'Role':

	;;(subclass-of PrehendingEntity Role)
	;;(subclass-of PrehendedEntity Role)
	;;(subclass-of Composite PrehendingEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendingEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendedEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Component PrehendedEntity)
	;;(subclass-of Whole Composite)
	;;(subclass-of Substrate Composite)
	;;(subclass-of Part Component)
	;;(subclass-of Property Component)
	;;(subclass-of Piece Part)
	;;(subclass-of Participant Part)
	;;(subclass-of Stage Part)
	;;(subclass-of Attribute Property)
	;;(subclass-of Manner Property)
	;;(subclass-of Determinant Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Source Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Product Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Immanent Participant)
	;;(subclass-of Initiator Determinant)
	;;(subclass-of Initiator Source)
	;;(subclass-of Resource Source)
	;;(subclass-of Resource Immanent)
	;;(subclass-of Goal Determinant)
	;;(subclass-of Goal Product)
	;;(subclass-of Essence Product)
	;;(subclass-of Essence Immanent)
	;;(subclass-of Agent Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Recipient Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Beneficiary Recipient)
	;;(subclass-of Completion Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Destination Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Duration Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Effector Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Experiencer Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Instrument Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Location Essence)
	;;(subclass-of Matter Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Medium Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Origin Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Path Resource)
	;;(subclass-of Patient Essence)
	;;(subclass-of PointInTime Essence)
	;;(subclass-of Result Goal)
	;;(subclass-of Start Initiator)
	;;(subclass-of Theme Essence)

	The Revised Case Roles (the version that appears in the latest
release of the merged ontology):

	(subclass-of Predicate Role)
	(subclass-of ComponentRelation Predicate)
	(instance-of part-of ComponentRelation)
	(subclass-of component-of part-of)
	(subclass-of external-covering component-of)
	(subclass-of internal-component-of component-of)
	(instance-of property-of ComponentRelation)
	(subclass-of BinaryRelation Predicate)
	(subclass-of TernaryRelation Predicate)
	(subclass-of VariableArityRelation Predicate)
	(subclass-of CaseRole BinaryRelation)
	(subclass-of IntentionalRelation BinaryRelation)
	(subclass-of IntentionalRelation IntentionalEntity)
	(subclass-of PropositionalAttitude IntentionalRelation)
	(subclass-of ObjectAttitude IntentionalRelation) 
	(instance-of stage-of ComponentRelation)
	(subclass-of attribute-of property-of)
	(subclass-of manner-of property-of)
	(instance-of source-of CaseRole)
	(instance-of agent CaseRole)
	(instance-of recipient CaseRole)
