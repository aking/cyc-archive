&gt; &gt; I have [changed] the title of this essay to reflect what
&gt; &gt; I see as the overlying difficulty of the underlying issues.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be better to stick with the title I proposed,
&gt; in terms of giving people a transparent idea what the
&gt; thread is about ...

OK, I will change it back.

I am in favor of transparency,
so long as we can see it for
what it is, at least, enough
that we do not try to walk
through the glass.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To summarize your message, there seem to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; at least the following alternative perspectives:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) semiotic concepts have no place in SUO,
&gt; &gt; &gt;    since ontologies are supposed to be about
&gt; &gt; &gt;    things that exist,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Notice what you just said, by way of stating this POV:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "ontologies are supposed to be about things that exist"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You have just told me what (you believe)
&gt; &gt; an ontology is "supposed" to be "about" --
&gt; &gt; you have not told me what an ontology is --
&gt; &gt; unless what it is reduces to the question
&gt; &gt; of what it is "supposed" to be "about".
&gt; &gt; Is that not an interesting observation?
&gt; 
&gt; It is a mistaken observation.
&gt; I merely tried to summarize three points of view.
&gt; I did not say that I personally suppose an ontology
&gt; can only be about things that exist.

I understood that part -- hence the hedge:  "by way of stating this POV" --
but staking out the nuances of your estimable propositional attitude and
distributing it throughout the whole discussion would have led me to use
an order of circumlocution that is beyond my powers and level of comfort.

&gt; &gt; Two questions almost immediately come to mind:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  "Supposed" by whom?  Unlike some folks,
&gt; &gt;     I do not have faith in disembodied POV's,
&gt; &gt;     so this is a question as to the implicit
&gt; &gt;     interpreters, the agents or the community,
&gt; &gt;     that are the bearers of this "supposition".
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if anyone subscribes to this first point of view,
&gt; they can speak for themselves.

Well, okay, I hope that they will,
but you probably already understand
that having to exposit a POV takes all
the fun out of being taken for granted.

&gt; &gt; 2.  What other sorts of things are defined by
&gt; &gt;     "what" they are "about", plus, perhaps,
&gt; &gt;     "how" they go "about" being "about" it?
&gt; &gt;     To spare you the suspense, those of us who
&gt; &gt;     did not discover the importance of signs
&gt; &gt;     suddenly last summer have been used to
&gt; &gt;     calling such things "sign relations".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     In this case, an "ontology", which,
&gt; &gt;     like its name SCREAMS out that it IS,
&gt; &gt;     to use that extra "UMPH" that appears
&gt; &gt;     hereabouts to be sufficient to deliver
&gt; &gt;     an embryonic sign into that status of
&gt; &gt;     being an honest-to-God -- and HE always
&gt; &gt;     knows who HE IS -- indicator of BEING,
&gt; &gt;     well, this onto+logy is neither being
&gt; &gt;     by itself nor signs by themselves, but,
&gt; &gt;     like its just keeps on hinting, a thing
&gt; &gt;     about relationships among sign-things
&gt; &gt;     and their object-things.  In short,
&gt; &gt;     an ontology is a sign relation, and
&gt; &gt;     so now I, at least, have just told
&gt; &gt;     you, perhaps for the first time in
&gt; &gt;     your hearing, what an ontology IS.
&gt; 
&gt; Gee, thanks very much for your powerful, religious insight.
&gt; It does not seem all that new, however.

Ah, then I welcome a fellow believer.
That's okay, if you hang around here
for a much longer time, then it will
start to seem "newer" with every new
day that passes into oblivion, among
people so afraid of reinventing that
tiresome old wheel, semiotics, again,
that they have siezed on a stratagem
of never reading any of the old work
that speaks of it.  Hey, it's a plan!

&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; Someone has to listen when I talk --
&gt; &gt; Why does it have to be only me!?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It would be interesting if you 'could' hear ...
&gt; &gt; The specific thoughts that I already stated ...
&gt; 
&gt; It would be interesting if you could write in words
&gt; that clearly conveyed specific thoughts.

Do you have some specific words in mind that failed to convey?

&gt; &gt; Then, we could begin to have a conversation ...
&gt; 
&gt; Before you take the mote out of my eye, pull the log out of yours.
