"Rate &amp; Tekken for Pave"

This is a nice example of Microsoft generated  non sense ( a kind of  free
creation).
The original text (corrected by the mail program  "intelligent" agent) was

"Arte &amp;Teknè for Pavia"... University.

Also Wassily Kandisky name have been changed.

Sorry but that's real life.

Subject: SUO: Re: Merged Ontology Update- Experiments


&gt;
&gt; I have decided to see if it  is possible to have some empiric feedback
&gt; about a specific ontology in a (partially) international context directly
&gt; from  users, in a simplified  but "real life" context, particularly from
the
&gt; point of view of learning, cognition and meaning creation.
&gt;
&gt; The idea is to  accumulated  experiences, in front of a common corpus of
&gt; knowledge, and results that  can be reproduced, in order to share results
&gt; and not opinions (sometimes expressed in papers).
&gt;
&gt; In fact I have some  experience of territory planning enough to know that
in
&gt; front of a similar (GIS) ontology and similar data people make often makes
&gt; different judgements. But perhaps governance is one of the most
complicated
&gt; human tasks.
&gt;
&gt; And I know from my past experience that in a corporation  (where many
&gt; conceptualization about the world are shared) is more easy to create a
&gt; common ontology  and a to define a participated agenda (for instance in
the
&gt; old Digital Equipment a method -so called - "Top Mapping", inspired by
&gt; Edgar Schein works about process consulting, have been used to address
this
&gt; kind of problems).
&gt;
&gt; So I have decided to see if it  where possible to have some empiric
feedback
&gt; about a specific ontology in a (partially) international context directly
&gt; from  users, in a simplified  but "real life" context, particularly from
the
&gt; point of view of learning, cognition and meaning creation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So please find here the description of  two (small, tentative and rude)
case
&gt; about ontology sharing and meaning relationship related to the only two
&gt; simplified social context I could find. Two courses of mine at Pavia's
&gt; University.
&gt;
&gt; But  I hope that  similar (more serious) experiments could be created in
&gt; corporations and  in other communities to support with a practice of
&gt; feedback  the SUO definition process and Suo knowledge and common practice
&gt; diffusion process.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Case 1. The ontology approach to real understanding and measure of reality
&gt; appears to be appealing, (at least)  to learned users. Context knowledge
&gt; seems more easy to conceptualize that a superior ontology (that in this
case
&gt; could not be identified).
&gt;
&gt; I've proposed  few and  very simplified upper ontology examples,  taken
from
&gt; Brentano, Cyc, GIS (from Sowa books) and from  a recent GianPiero Zarri
&gt; (CNRS)  work (Intelligent database systems - Zarri and others
Addison-Wesley
&gt; 2001)  to a group of 27 selected graduated (with a bachelor in some kind
of
&gt; human science and  with strong knowledge in technology) students (mostly
&gt; Italians but with few students from South America and actually one from
&gt; Russia)  in a short  (45 hours)  course  of mine ( New Economy: media  &amp;
&gt; technology in Media Science and New Technology  International Master in
&gt; Pavia <A  HREF="http://media.iuss.unipv.it">http://media.iuss.unipv.it</A>), asking them to define an ontology
&gt; suitable to express a business model in a given context they knew.
&gt;
&gt; I've proposed also GianPiero's "conversational" approach (that is based on
&gt; such a basic concepts as SORTAL -  an economic entity or a
&gt; human_being_or_soc.body - and NON_SORTAL_CONCEPTS - where a
&gt; characterizing_concept is a color for instance) because the taxonomy
&gt; appeared  to be (to me at least) not too far to some (simple) KM
commercial
&gt; solution available on the market (as Livelink from open text that the
&gt; students knew) and suitable for a course on economics and technology.
&gt;
&gt; All the students declared to like this ontology oriented business analysis
&gt; exercise very much but they produced only very rude
(agent-patient-context)
&gt; ontologies about the various business, and   they, apparently,  did not
pay
&gt; to much attention to the superior upper ontology problem. There was no
time
&gt; to get into the details, but also this case seems to suggest  that context
&gt; knowledge comes first of the need to define a standard superior ontology.
&gt;
&gt; Case 2. A standard ontology  helps meaning creation
&gt;
&gt; I've decided to use a more precise approach in a second short course (a 30
&gt; hours -experimental and cross- disciplinary with 15 people ranging from
&gt; first year undergraduate - and from engineering to fine arts to graduated
&gt; master students) about communication and arts (Rate &amp; Tekken for Pave
&gt; University)  to understand the relationship between ontology and meaning
&gt; creation, using a very simple GIs-like and visual ontology.
&gt;
&gt;   In fact  Washy Kandisky's 1923 conceptualization  ( Punkt und Linie zu
&gt; Flaeche)  Point,  Line surface,, and Peirce's semiotic
&gt; conceptualizations,from Sowa book,  may be easily used to create link
&gt; Art-ontology  with technologies.
&gt;
&gt; The students where asked to produce a creation using simple multimedia
tools
&gt; (available on common PC) out of a basic sign ontology.
&gt;
&gt; To help them in this creation process   I've asked to few friend artists
&gt; that work  in Kandisky line of artistic researches (that has produced the
&gt; famous "cut on canvas" from Lucio Fontana for instance)  to provide
&gt; elements to the students  about  basic signs  creation (Italian maestro
&gt; Agostino Ferrari), and about  space and context creation  (Japanese Oky
&gt; Izumi). This because of this artists experiences in a world-wide context (
&gt; between west and Asia). Oki Izumi is an artist that work only with
geometric
&gt; solid shapes made of slices of glass. She produces the things of art more
&gt; close to math and geometry  that I ever seen.  And a live example of  free
&gt; meaning creation from a very basic and simplified ontology. (To complete
the
&gt; scene with sounds a composer  has covered the musical basic semiotic which
&gt; was about signs, sounds  &amp; spaces and technology).
&gt;
&gt; This line of  (conceptual) mostly visual  artistic researches looks for
&gt; "natural" components of meaning creation, as well as to cross-culture to
&gt; produce  universal meanings.
&gt;
&gt; As expected  this time (in 2 instance by now) the proposed visual basic
&gt; ontology  have been used by the student to create  a multimedia
application
&gt; that  was personal and new but that at the same time appeared to be based
on
&gt; standard  (Icon) group of signs and appreciated  and understood  by the
&gt; audience. (At the end of next month all the people will present the final
&gt; work so I'll have the final results).
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, by now we have learned that while a glass cube is a
glass
&gt; cube, for the Japanese world  the meaning of a cube in a context may be
&gt; different than  for a western world .  This for historically different
&gt; "cultural"  reasons. In fact the  Japanese  traditional  art  is
&gt; BI-dimensional.
&gt;
&gt; Also this case seems to confirm that meaning  arise from (abduction about)
&gt; contingent physical, natural and cultural ambits.
&gt;
&gt; These case of course are very far from being accurate (and somebody could
&gt; argue that these aren't even tests).
&gt;
&gt; But  making experiments   may be another possible way to create a
&gt; distributed network of learned communities  interested in sorting out a
&gt; shared ontology as a communication common assets by means of results in
&gt; context that can be reproduced,  perhaps using a first  basic proposal
from
&gt; a small community of experts interested in supporting real life
&gt; applications.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Best wishes.

&gt; Subject: SUO: Merged Ontology Update
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just wanted to give everyone an update on the Merged Ontology.
&gt; &gt; In line with the suggestion from many sources that we should be guided
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; below rather than above in our ontological engineering, I've stripped
down
&gt; &gt; the top level once again.  I've tried to eliminate all concepts that are
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; necessary to support any of the content of the middle-level ontologies
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; have been incorporated thus far.  The resulting high-level structure can
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; summarized as follows (where the indentations indicate subclass-of
&gt; &gt; relations).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Entity
&gt; &gt; Physical
&gt; &gt; Object
&gt; &gt; Process
&gt; &gt; Relation
&gt; &gt; Abstract
&gt; &gt; Set
&gt; &gt; Proposition
&gt; &gt; Quantity
&gt; &gt; Attribute
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I invite everyone to examine these concepts and the ones subsumed by
them
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; our ontology browser (<A  HREF="http://ontology.teknowledge.com/rsigma/">http://ontology.teknowledge.com/rsigma/</A>).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Aside from paring down the high-level structure of the Merged Ontology,
&gt; I've
&gt; &gt; added and revised many of the docu-strings in the ontology, formulated
&gt; many
&gt; &gt; new axioms, and tried to achieve a tighter integration of all of the
&gt; content
&gt; &gt; in the ontology.  One area that still needs further integration is
&gt; &gt; mereotopology.  Currently, definitions and axioms are scattered in three
&gt; &gt; different sections of the ontology:  the mereotopology proper, the
section
&gt; &gt; on holes based on Varzi and Casati's work, and the section on Positions
&gt; &gt; (everything in this section is a subrelation-of the BinaryRelation
&gt; &gt; position).  I welcome any criticisms of or comments on anything in the
&gt; &gt; current version of the Merged Ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; -Ian
&gt; &gt;
