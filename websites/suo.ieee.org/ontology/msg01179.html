Phil,

I take you to be expressing a genuine concern here,
and not just a matter of arbitrary nomenclature or
contractual terminology, and so I will try to face
my muse in the same spirit, and hope that she will
inspire me to a more straightforward type of quest.
As muses go, however, fortunately and contrariwise,
she is not so easy to be ruled, and so I hope that
you will take sympathy on my efforts to be prosaic.
Nevertheless, I will need to start out in what you
may imagine to be a far too impressionistic manner,
not quite appearing to track all of the details of
what you have so carefully taken the time to write.
But I can assure you that this appearance would be
far from the truth of the matter, and that it more
nearly due to the pressure of memories crowding in
upon my brain, of all the times that I myself have
been distracted with nagging doubts about ultimate
questions:  of actuality, of being, of contingency,
of determinacy and determination, entity, exigency,
existence, free will, possibility, aye, of reality.

In this connection, being as I have come to be, I will naturally resort
to the tactic of referring you to yet another bit of "Chapter &amp; Peirce",
namely, the article that he published in 1908 that was given the rather
leading and mis-leading, suggestive and astraying, all at the same time,
moniker of "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God" (CP 6.452-493).
I am sorry that we pragmatic thinkers must seem to be so utterly devoid
of creative juices that we have to keep returning to this single source,
but we find that gold is where you find it.  Anyway, I bring this essay
to your attention for several distinct reasons, not all of them obvious,
perhaps, from sole contemplation of its ostensible subject, but because
of the method of inquiry that is analyzed, displayed, exemplified there
in a way that is, to my way of thinking, Peirce's finest exemplar of it.

Moreover, this discusssion is one of the places where Peirce
most clearly presents several important distinctions that he
adopted from the Scholastic Philosophers, of particular note
to us in our present concern, the distinctions that they saw
among actuality, entity, existence, potential, reality, just
to mention the most salient predicates among their whole set.

Next time, I will try to develop the bearing of these distinctions
on the analogous questions about the nature of a Supreme Supertype.

Sadly, I cannot find an online copy of "NAFTROG" anywhere, but while I was
poking around at the old Arisbe Farm, looking for one, I did happen to run
across these additional papers, apparently earlier drafts, in part, of the
"Questions" and the "Incapacities" series, which shed some extra light for
me on the questions of our present undertaking.  Maybe they will be useful.
