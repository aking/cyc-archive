Dear Pat,

&gt;    You can, of course, forward this or any part to the whole
&gt; list if you feel it appropriate.

Yes, I think an open discussion of process would be a good idea,
so I am sending this reply to the whole list. It is of course
Jim's responsibility to ensure we have and operate an appropriate
process.

What we might decide now doesn't prevent us from changing our 
minds about how to conduct our business later, but it will at 
least set some expectations for what might happen.
 
See some comments below.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; Subject: Re: SUO: Resolution Process
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt;   Since there hasn't been a second yet, I am directing this to 
&gt; you individually.

MW: I was not making a formal proposal, just starting a discussion
(simultaneiously with Jim) that might lead to a formal resolution
about the process we intend to operate.

&gt;    I agree that both formality and speed are important, but one 
&gt; week seems like a very short time when volunteers can get busy 
&gt; doing other things, or going on vacation, or to conferences.
&gt; Perhaps there should be a provision to re-open a discussion
&gt; within a time frame of one month from the original proposal,
&gt; if any member has an objection that they were not able to
&gt; enter prior to that point.

MW: My assumption is that this will normally only affect a small
number of members, say less than 5. If the difference in the ballot
(for vs against) was less than 5 then I would be concerned about
the validity of the decision, and it would seem reasonable to 
extend the voting period for another week.

&gt;    I think there should be a minimum number of "yes" votes 
&gt; required for passage of any proposal, since I think 
&gt; the SUO only has a chance of being widely adopted if 
&gt; it actually represents a consesus of some reasonable 
&gt; number of participants; perhaps 20 would be required on
&gt; general issues, and 10 on specialized issues?.  

MW: I disagree. If we have a high hurdle, like 5 seconds, for
having a vote at all, then I don't think this should be an issue.
Equally, I expect that there will be a number of different groups
working on different aspects of the problem, and that some might 
produce a deliverable that was relatively specialist, int he sense
that only a small number of people would feel competent to vote.
Personally, I would want to encourage people who recognise their
incompetence to abstain, which would give greater weight to the
votes of those who were competent, and that would be how it should 
be.

MW: In ISO TC184/SC4 this problem is overcome to some extent by
having national rather than individual votes. At least 9 or 10 of the
countries involved will have experts in any particular field, so you
get the concentration another way.

&gt; For the 
&gt; same reason, I think that a quorum of a majority of members 
&gt; should be required to make some response, but members should 
&gt; be encouraged to send in an "abstain" response on those 
&gt; issues for which they are willing to accept the decision
&gt; of a smaller working group.
&gt;    In order to make the quorum work, it may be necessary to 
&gt; **require** registered voting members to vote at least by
&gt; abstention on at least one-half the issues called for vote,
&gt; in order to maintain their registered status.
&gt; Failing to vote on one-half the issues over some period, e.g.
&gt; three months, would make one a probationary voting member, and 
&gt; failure in the following three-month period would then lead
&gt; to removal from the voting list, with a waiting period of 
&gt; three months before registry can be renewed, if desired.

MW: The Swiss solution for enforced democracy (I think they are
legally required to vote). I don't really mind. In my view
votes should be on political issues, technical issues should
be dealt with through an issue resolution process which does 
encorporate some voting, but it is not at the micro technical
level but at an overall "fitnes for purpose" level. So I don't
think there should be more than 1 or 2 votes in a 3 month
period - so if we're not careful we would all get non-voting
status.

&gt; 
&gt;    It probably seems overly complicated, but the main
&gt; issue I am addressing is that we are trying to build
&gt; a standard that might be very widely used, and I think
&gt; we should make every effort to try to make the results
&gt; truly as representative as possible of a wide group.
&gt; Some mandatory participation would, I think, help 
&gt; the members feel that a serious and determined effort is 
&gt; underway, worth the time required to participate.

MW: Well this sounds like you think we should vote an axiom at
a time on the deliverables we produce. I'm afraid I think this
is a recipe for disaster, well OK not very much progress, and
a strong chance of an inconsistent result.

&gt;    You can, of course, forward this or any part to the whole
&gt; list if you feel it appropriate.

&gt; &gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Introduction
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You will be aware that Jim has been asking several of us if we
&gt; &gt; will propose specific pieces of work to be a focus of activity
&gt; &gt; for the SUO group, and I am one of the people he has approached.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The idea is that we might adopt a number of work items which
&gt; &gt; members of the SUO may choose to contribute to. This implies
&gt; &gt; formally accepting them as work items within the SUO work group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since we don't have much practise of doing things formally here
&gt; &gt; I am going to start by proposing the process I think we should
&gt; &gt; adopt. It is a straight copy of what we do in ISO TC184/SC4, and
&gt; &gt; is probably based on Roberts' Rules.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Below is a resolution that is what you are formally asked to
&gt; &gt; vote on. Before it is an introduction that provides background
&gt; &gt; material to the resolution. The introduction does not form part
&gt; &gt; of the resolution. To proceed the resolution requires a second.
&gt; &gt; If/when a second is found, then the resolution is open for
&gt; &gt; discussion. Comments may be made about the appropriateness of
&gt; &gt; the resolution and changes may be suggested. The proposer has
&gt; &gt; the absolute right to accept or reject any proposed changes
&gt; &gt; (it is their resolution). If there have been no negative
&gt; &gt; comments, then the chair may seek to pass the resolution by
&gt; &gt; acclamation (silence is consent). Otherwise you move to a vote.
&gt; &gt; A simple majority of those voting for over those voting against
&gt; &gt; (abstentions don't count) is sufficient to pass the resolution.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since we are an e-mail community the principle issue is timing.
&gt; &gt; Especially since members may not be "present" at all times.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suggest that a minimum of 1 week is allowed for discussion,
&gt; &gt; after which the proposer may call for a vote at any time at
&gt; &gt; their discretion. I suggest that 1 week is allowed for votes
&gt; &gt; to be made by voting members, and that non-votes (silence) is
&gt; &gt; taken as abstention. Votes may either be to the chair or the
&gt; &gt; list as individuals prefer.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know some people here are suspicious of any degree of
&gt; &gt; formality in what we do, so I think it is worth noting that
&gt; &gt; a resolution represents the position of the group as a whole.
&gt; &gt; The group has no power over its members and no decision of the
&gt; &gt; group can require any action of any individual. Resolutions
&gt; &gt; usually offer approval, or encouragement for certain actions
&gt; &gt; that are proposed, approval of deliverables for certain
&gt; &gt; purposes, or agreeing to follow certain procedures in how
&gt; &gt; we conduct our business. (If what I have done here goes
&gt; &gt; beyond elucidating what Roberts' Rules says anyway, then
&gt; &gt; the subject of this note could well be the basis of a
&gt; &gt; resolution in this last category.)
