&gt;John,
&gt;  Our work can only proceed by people making concrete suggestions 
&gt;about how to reconcile, integrate and improve the content we're 
&gt;starting with.

Adam, greetings. You are making a central mistake here. Axioms do not 
comprise content. We don't have ANY content until we know what an 
axiomatic ontology claims to be about. First we have to determine 
what the content of an ontology actually IS.  Once we have that 
reasonably clear, we can make a start on trying to integrate two of 
them.

Look at the ontologies which Niles has cobbled together here, and ask 
what they are supposed to be about. There is the Casarti/Varzi 
ontology of 'holes', whose axioms contain quantifiers which are 
intended to range over a certain subclass of pieces of space (those 
which can be thought of as holes in some other, physical, object). 
Then there is the overarching Entire Theory of the Universe 
represented by John Sowa's upper-level ontology classification. 
Evidently, when one of John's axioms uses a 'forall', it doesnt mean 
the same as what one of C&amp;V's axioms mean when it uses a 'forall'; 
John's universal quantifier ranges over a much, much larger set of 
things than the C&amp;V universal quantifers do. Its not even clear to me 
that the range of the C&amp;V quantifiers can be characterised within the 
classification scheme which Niles has extracted from John, in fact . 
(I'm sure that there are several Sowa-classs into which the 
C&amp;V-quantifications can be placed, but I am not at all sure there is 
one that fits them exactly, which is what we need in order to put a 
suitable restriction onto the quantifiers in the C&amp;V axioms.) Every 
'source' from which Niles has lifted axioms has a distinct notion of 
what is in its universe, and the axioms were written with that 
universe in  mind. That is what I meant by saying that the various 
parts of Niles' axiom-collection have incompatible assumptions. When 
you move a universal quantifer from one universe to another, the 
likelihood of its remaining true is vanishingly small.

&gt; It's easy to say that any proposal is inadequate.  My hope is that 
&gt;you and others with propose specific improvements.  Ian has done 
&gt;considerably more than just merge sources into a common notation.
&gt;  Certainly, different ontologies may not have strong connections 
&gt;with one another.  I don't believe that is required.  Every branch 
&gt;of a tree need not be strongly connected to a large set of siblings. 
&gt;The important features I would say are that the branches are not 
&gt;inconsistent or redundant.  I believe that has been achieved.

I am absolutely certain that it has not. I am not talking about 
branches of a tree; that is beside the point (and also, incidentally, 
misunderstands the nature of Sowa'a classification scheme, which is 
lattice-based rather than tree-like.) My point (which Ive already 
made to Niles) is that every time one adjoins an axiom from one 
ontology into another ontology, you have to carefully re-think 
exactly what every quantifier means, and ask youself whether, and if 
so how, the intended meaning of the quantification can be stated in 
the larger, merged, ontology. You also need to ask youself what all 
the relation names mean and now they need to be translated into the 
other terminology. Sometimes they might, if you are remarkably lucky, 
translate into relations there as well. More likely they will have to 
be rendered as quantified restrictions on other relations, so that (R 
A B) might have to be translated as something like
(exists (?y)(and(implies (phi ?y) (R1 A ?y)) (implies (rho ?y)(R2  B 
?y)) )), where rho and phi are themselves complex assertions. This 
means that a simple universal quantification becomes an nested 
quantifier statement which will generate new nonlogical vocabulary 
when skolemised, and there is good chance that you will need new 
axioms for those skolem functions when you start thinking about what 
they mean. We found that even in translating between alternative 
axiom systems for mereotopology that there were cases where a simple 
relational assertion became a triply nested quantification scheme, 
and a two-line axiom translated into expressions with five nested 
alternating quantifiers, just because one world view only quantified 
over regular sets, and the other allowed surface and edge fragments 
to be first-class entities.  God alone knows what would have happened 
if there had been things like nexuses and abstracta and firstnesses 
in the universe as well.

&gt;The tree may be considered sparse or denuded, but that's to be 
&gt;expected at this early stage.

A bundle of sticks is not a tree.
