Pat, 
	.	Comments interspersed, prefaced "GH&gt;	". 

	.	I have a more involved structure in mind than is necessarily
evident in any particular communication.

&gt;Douglas,
&gt;	.		Why should what you are saying necessarily be so?
&gt;
&gt;	.	To me you are addressing the matter that, often, people
&gt;don't precisely define their utterances, with the result that the
&gt;information interpreted doesn't always match that uttered. But, that
&gt;doesn't mean that everyone is as ambiguous as everyone else, nor
&gt;that ambiguity is unavoidable if sufficient care is expended to be
&gt;precise.
&gt;
&gt;	.	Leaving out all sorts of issues of freedom for people to
&gt;express themselves as they wish, including as ambiguously as
&gt;they like, why will not the precision of computer languages serve
&gt;to achieve unambiguity? Allowing for the severely restricted
&gt;vocabulary, if I communicate to you in a computer language in
&gt;which you are literate, surely you will understand precisely what I
&gt;say?

No, you won't. When was the last time you actually READ code, instead of
running it?

GH&gt;	In view of your tone, how about you guess first? You might also care
to speculate about what I have conceived and developed with it also. 

But theres a deeper misunderstanding here. When you say 'computer language'
do you mean 'programming language' (which is only even called a 'language'
by a kind of extension from normal usage) or do you mean 'language for
expressing meanings which is stored in a computer' ? 

GH&gt;	Whether it's one or the other makes very little conceptual
difference. The concept is that each element has a precisely defined
interpretation. Note that I did NOT say "a precisely defined
implementation". 

There is nothing particularly *computerish* about an ontology language; or
if there is, that aspect of it adds nothing to its conceptual or ontological
clarity or precision. 

GH&gt;	Well, we agree on that one. 
&gt;
&gt;	.	If we start from this sort of basis, and I don't care
&gt;whether it's using a "CE" or "KIF", then why won't we achieve
&gt;unambiguous communication?

Because KIF and CE only specify the logical framework within which the
ontological meanings are to be expressed, not those meanings themselves. Not
that this is to be sneezed at, I hasten to add; but it isnt a magical
guarantee against misunderstanding. 

GH&gt; 	Yes, you've picked me up validly here. I should have said: ".....
then why won't we be able to achieve unambiguous communication?" 
&gt;
&gt;	.	I admit, that when it comes to expressing complex
&gt;and/or sophisticated concepts, then the communication will require: 
&gt;*	prefacing with some assumed structure (eg. possibly the
&gt;concept that anger arises out of fear); and
&gt;*	a great deal of elaboration to ensure every aspect is defined.

You should read Quine on the indeterminacy of translation, and then see if
you are still so confident that this 'great deal of elaboration' is always
going to work. 

GH&gt; 	My statement may have to be read in light of some of my previous
contributions. If one starts with a small and precisely defined structure,
then one can be precise within the scope of that structure. 

GH&gt; 	I am NOT saying any language will be able to achieve perfect
unambiguous communication in all circumstances. As the breadth of coverage
extends, it will periodically be necessary to amend particular terms, and
even, from time to time, conceptual structures. 

GH&gt; 	The advance of humanity and technology have repeatedly involved this
sort of mechanism throughout history. For example, the Earth used to be seen
as the centre of the Universe. Later this status was accorded the Sun. More
recently the conceptual structure had to change yet more. 

GH&gt; 	However, I am suggesting that a basic structure can be developed to
have "meta-" elements that allow extrapolation to cover quite a range of
matters, provided the extrapolation is done in a carefully structured way. 

GH&gt; 	Speaking as a one time research &amp; development, and innovative
design, engineer, I realise it is very appealing to feel there is a "perfect
way" to achieve one's aims. Unfortunately any development is usually
constrained by the technological insights of the day. Of course, it's always
possible to achieve an optimal solution beyond them by chance, but that only
happens rarely and isn't generally repeatable without slavishly repeating
all aspects, since one doesn't know which ones were critical to the success.


GH&gt; 	Regardless of what language we use, the same aspects will apply. Jon
Awbrey has been trying to warn us of this aspect throughout the project.
Using KIF does not avoid the problem you are raising.
