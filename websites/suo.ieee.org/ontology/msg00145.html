Both, 
	.	While I have no problems discussing the fine subtleties
about the many shades of meanings able to be attributed to individual symbol
items within a symbology, I suggest this is wandering from our aim. 

	.	In the SUO, we will inevitably find certain items require
amendments in definitions, whether to improve accuracy and/or precision, or
because technology or society changes our perspectives, understandings and
requirements. Definition systems have been coping with such issues since the
first lexicon was developed, haven't they? Don't we call this version
control (in engineering, a related concept is configuration control)? The
larger field of version/configuration management includes such issues as
policies of how often configuration control processes are invoked, and how
they are indicated, etc. 

	.	In messaging systems, etc., this issue is handled by one of
the methods I suggested for the SUO-CE. With each message one piece of
information transmitted is the identity and version of the definition system
being assumed. That way, no ambiguity or errors result. I suggest we will
need to take a similar approach with the SUO. 

	.	I feel we would do better to look at how we can achieve the
ontology. As with so much of this field, numerous ways have been developed
over aeons to remove unintended problems of ambiguities. 

	.	By all means identify and define sources of ambiguity.
Indeed, we will have to catalogue them as part of the overall exercise, in
order to manage them. 

	.	But, please can we get onto a pro-active attitude of how we
manage things? 

	.	I suggest we have had too much of the negative approach of
concentrating on the problems to the exclusion of the solutions.

Doug,

OK.  I think we agree under a suitable definition of our terms.

&gt;But, on the main point, I think you are still drawing a misleading
&gt;parallelism.  In your note below, it seems to me that you are equating the

&gt;language of computer science (a technical lexicon that is comparable to the

&gt;lexicons of law, business, cooking, etc.) with programming languages.  The

&gt;language of computer science is used by human beings to communicate with
&gt;each other.  A programming language is used by humans to instruct machines.

&gt;In my mind, at least, this is a significant ontological distinction.  One
&gt;of the implications of this distinction is that polysemy is much less
&gt;acceptable in any programming language than it is in any human-to-human
&gt;language.

I would say that "assignment statement" has a unique meaning
within a given implementation of a particular version of a
compiler for a particular programming language.  However,
the next update to the compiler or to the language may create
a slightly different meaning for that term.

So I think that we agree that the terms of computer science
are polysemous across multiple languages.  Even within
what is sometimes called a single language (e.g. C, COBOL,
FORTRAN, etc.), many of the terms may be polysemous across
different versions of the language, different implementations
of compilers for the "same version", and even different versions
of what is called the "same compiler" for the "same language".

John
