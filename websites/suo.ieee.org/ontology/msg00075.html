David, John,

Many things come to mind as I read this exchange,
most of which I have been worrying over or working on
for quite some time now, and only a few of which I can
render effable in the form of this kibbitzing commentary.
Still, you may find a few sporadic remarks dis-peirced below.

&gt; 
&gt; David,
&gt; 
&gt; There are a lot of complex issues involved in these discussions,
&gt; and at the moment, I'll just mention one that I believe has caused
&gt; a lot of confusion:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems that we don't have any way to define what equality means
&gt; &gt; for a particular subclass.  Perhaps I should include this in the
&gt; &gt; next version of the structural ontology.  I'm thinking that two
&gt; &gt; variables that may potentially refer to the same thing can be
&gt; &gt; said to be equal (within the limits provided by some class)
&gt; &gt; if they are similar using all the similarity predicates of
&gt; &gt; that class.
&gt; 
&gt; This is getting into some very sticky issues, indeed.
&gt; I would like to quote some points that Wittgenstein
&gt; made about the "=" sign in his _Tractatus_:
&gt; 
&gt; 4.241 If I use two signs with one and the same meaning,
&gt; I express this by putting between them the sign "=".
&gt; "a=b" means then that the sign "a" is replaceable by
&gt; the sign "b".
&gt; 
&gt; The point here is that equality is a relation between signs,
&gt; not a relation between things.  Its total meaning is to state
&gt; the conditions for performing the operation of replacement.

Three issues come to mind:

1.  I have come to believe that different agents (interpreters, observers)
    are bound to partition the actual world in different ways, in other words,
    to form a diversity of "equivalence class structures" (ECS's, read as "excess")
    in their minds, which they then project in the manner of "reticules" or "templates"
    upon the world, by way of forming their "correticulations" or "contemplations" of
    the scenes that fall under their respective surveys.

    "Reticule"? --

    "There's a double meaning in that."  ('Much Ado About Nothing', Benedick, 2.3.246).

    At least, they seem bound to do this, if not in the beginning, Genesis-ly speaking,
    or not in the end, optimystically speaking about the End of Inquiry, then somewhere
    in the "middle of things" (motley of choices), where all of us, I gather, now live.

    Of course, when I say that agents partition the world I am not talking about
    papal writs of demarcation, the ambivalent (ambiary) ambitions of imperialism,
    the "artifactual intelligence community" (AIC), or other form of global politics,
    but I did not really think that you would think that, not really.

2.  Independently, in an all too conspiratorial sense of "independence",
    of whether and how agents do in fact partition the world in general,
    which may incodentally include the subworld (supworld?) of signs in
    its fold, it is all the more evident that they do indeed partition
    all of these ephemeral, eternal, infernal domains of signs into
    a vast multiplicity of many-splintered ECStasies.

    By way of making a formal approach to these partitions of signs,
    the ones that obtain with full respect to each particular agent
    of interpretation, for here it is the agent's especial subrole
    as "interrupreter" of the objective world that we now observe
    coming to the fore in the play of things, I find that one has
    to give up the ghost of dyadic relations like those that are
    meant to be denoted by "=", and ascend to indexed dyadics,
    which, as you may guess, are actually triadic relations.

    Furthermore, once we have a firm concept of formal objects
    like "equivalence class structures" (ECS's) or "partitions" --
    and some recent research has extended this to the contemplation
    of "partial equivalence relations" (PER's) -- then we can afford
    to loosen our former fixation on and our near mystification by
    signs like "=".

    By the way, this manner of rigidity in sign use is
    an object example of what I, myself, would be led
    to criticize under that lately bandied-about nomen
    of "reifying syntax".

    To sum up, I think that we need to buckle up, knuckle down,
    and realize that we will have to look much more carefully
    at the various and sundry sorts of "semantic partitions"
    and "semiotic partitions" -- they are often different! --
    that actual sign users exercise on their common syntax.
    In the best of worlds, we will find that these ECS's are
    strongly correlated, although hardly ever in trivial ways,
    and that the parts of their partitions do indeed give us the
    best clues that we can ever have about the forms of objective
    structures that any community of agents knows wot of, at least,
    in their plural and their shared ontologies.

    Oh, I almost forgot to remind you -- I have several times now given you
    a minimal example of a situation in which such alternative partitions may
    be seen to arise, namely, in the 'Story of A and B', for instance, here:

    <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00729.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00729.html</A>

3.  The "proper treatment of substitution" (PTOS) is a job description that has,
    for quite some time now, been more or less ably filled by Lambda Calculus,
    but I think that we are beginning to experience the effects of some wear
    and tear around the edges, and I peircenally believe that it is time to
    look toward the not too radical substitution, acronymphically speaking,
    of a "pragmatic theory of signs" (PTOS).

&gt; But you seem to be adding some sort of qualification to
&gt; that operation:  "within the limits provided by some class".
&gt; That sounds like a strange qualification, which the model
&gt; theory for KIF would not support (or even recognize).

I, too, am left uncertain as to David's meaning for the "subclass" hedge,
but that may just be because I have forgotten who in our group is speaking
in the "theory of classes and sets" (Tocasese) and who is speaking any one
of several other philological descendents of Babelese, so I will wait for
further clarification from David on that score.

Well, I did not mean to say this much,
so I will break off here, for a while.

Cheers,

Jon Awbrey

Remainder of original note follows:

&gt; Another quotation from W:
&gt; 
&gt; 5.5301. That identity is not a relation between objects is
&gt; obvious....
&gt; 
&gt; 5.5303. Roughly speaking:  To say of _two_ things that they
&gt; are identical is nonsense.  To say of _one_ thing that it is
&gt; identical with itself is to say nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, to say "the class Individual consists of all things
&gt; that are equal to themselves" says nothing about any of them.
&gt; 
&gt; That would imply that everything is an individual, and that
&gt; the class Individual is everything.  That is another way of
&gt; saying that the word "individual" says nothing.  If so, I
&gt; would recommend that we put it on the list of words that are
&gt; unnecessary for the SUO vocabulary.
&gt; 
&gt; John
