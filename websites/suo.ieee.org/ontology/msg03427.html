Jon, compare with this one too... &quot;unconscious deductions&quot; belong to the
category of oxymorons (which is the genuine form of a moron), in my
opinion you are about to invent the science of &quot;oxymorology&quot;:

CP 2.182
Reasoning, properly speaking, cannot be unconsciously performed. A
mental operation may be precisely like reasoning in every other respect
except that it is performed unconsciously. But that one circumstance
will deprive it of the title of reasoning. For reasoning is deliberate,
voluntary, critical, controlled, all of which it can only be if it is
done consciously. An unconscious act is involuntary: an involuntary act
is not subject to control; an uncontrollable act is not deliberate nor
subject to criticism in the sense of approval or blame. A performance
which cannot be called good or bad differs most essentially from
reasoning.

CP 2.183
This does not imply that we must be aware of the whole process of the
mind in reasoning or, indeed, of any portion of it. It is very desirable
to have a clear apprehension of this distinction. We are, so to speak,
responsible for the correctness of our reasonings. That is to say,
unless we deliberately approve of them as rational, they cannot properly
be called reasonings. But for this purpose, all that is necessary is
that we should, in each case, compare premisses and conclusion, and
observe that the relation between the facts expressed in the premisses
involves the relation between facts implied in our confidence in the
conclusion. What we call a reasoning is something upon which we place a
stamp of rational approval. In order to do that, we must know what the
reasoning is. In that sense, it must be a conscious act, just as a man
is not bound by a contract if it can be proved that he signed it in his
sleep. It must be his conscious act and deed. But for that purpose he
only needs to know the character of the relation between the premisses
and the conclusion. He need not know precisely what operations the mind
went through in passing from the one to the other. That is a matter of
detail which is not essential to his responsibility. The mind is like
the conveyancer who has drawn up a deed. What books he looked into in
choosing his verbiage is no concern of the person who signs, provided he
knows what the paper binds him to doing.

&gt; 
&gt; Expectation, Satisfaction, Disappointment

&gt; 
&gt; Compare &amp; Contrast:
&gt; 
&gt; Exhibit 1
&gt; 
&gt; | Reasoning &amp; Expectation
&gt; |
&gt; | But since you propose to study logic, you have more or less faith
&gt; | in reasoning, as affording knowledge of the truth.  Now reasoning
&gt; | is a very different thing indeed from the percept, or even from
&gt; | perceptual facts.  For reasoning is essentially a voluntary act,
&gt; | over which we exercise control.  If it were not so, logic would
&gt; | be of no use at all.  For logic is, in the main, criticism of
&gt; | reasoning as good or bad.  Now it is idle so to criticize
&gt; | an operation which is beyond all control, correction,
&gt; | or improvement.  (CP 2.144).
&gt; |
&gt; | You have, therefore, to inquire, first, in what sense you have
&gt; | any faith in reasoning, seeing that its conclusions cannot in
&gt; | the least resemble the percepts, upon which alone implicit
&gt; | reliance is warranted.  Conclusions of reasoning can little
&gt; | resemble even the 'perceptual facts'.  For besides being
&gt; | involuntary, these latter are strictly memories of what
&gt; | has taken place in the recent past, while all conclusions
&gt; | of reasoning partake of the general nature of expectations
&gt; | of the future.  What two things can be more disparate than
&gt; | a memory and an expectation?  (CP 2.145).
&gt; |
&gt; | ...
&gt; |
&gt; | The second branch of the question, when you have decided in what
&gt; | your faith in reasoning consists, will inquire just what it is
&gt; | that justifies that faith.  The stimulation of doubt about things
&gt; | indubitable or not really doubted is no more wholesome than is
&gt; | any other humbug;  yet the precise specification of the evidence
&gt; | for an undoubted truth often in logic throws a brilliant light
&gt; | in one direction or in another, now pointing to a corrected
&gt; | formulation of the proposition, now to a better comprehension
&gt; | of its relations to other truths, again to some valuable
&gt; | distinctions, etc.  (CP 2.147).
&gt; |
&gt; | As to the former branch of this question, it will be found
&gt; | upon consideration that it is precisely the analogy of an
&gt; | inferential conclusion to an expectation which furnishes the
&gt; | key to the matter.  An expectation is a habit of imagining.
&gt; | A habit is not an affection of consciousness;  it is a general
&gt; | law of action, such that on a certain general kind of occasion
&gt; | a man will be more or less apt to act in a certain general way.
&gt; | An imagination is an affection of consciousness which can be
&gt; | directly compared with a percept in some special feature, and
&gt; | be pronounced to accord or disaccord with it.  Suppose for
&gt; | example that I slip a cent into a slot, and expect on pulling
&gt; | a knob to see a little cake of chocolate appear.  My expectation
&gt; | consists in, or at least involves, such a habit that when I think
&gt; | of pulling the knob, I imagine I see a chocolate coming into view.
&gt; | When the perceptual chocolate comes into view, my imagination of it
&gt; | is a feeling of such a nature that the percept can be compared with
&gt; | it as to size, shape, the nature of the wrapper, the color, taste,
&gt; | flavor, hardness and grain of what is within.  Of course, every
&gt; | expectation is a matter of inference.  What an inference is we
&gt; | shall soon see more exactly than we need just now to consider.
&gt; | For our present purpose it is sufficient to say that the
&gt; | inferential process involves the formation of a habit.
&gt; | For it produces a belief, or opinion;  and a genuine
&gt; | belief, or opinion, is something on which a man is
&gt; | prepared to act, and is therefore, in a general sense,
&gt; | a habit.  A belief need not be conscious.  (CP 2.148).
&gt; |
&gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 2.144-148.
&gt; 
&gt; Exhibit 2
&gt; 
&gt; | The Experience of Satisfaction
&gt; |
&gt; | The filling of the nuclear neurones in Psi has as its
&gt; | consequence an effort to discharge, an impetus which is
&gt; | released along motor pathways.  Experience shows that the
&gt; | first path to be followed is that leading to 'internal change'
&gt; | (e.g., emotional expression, screaming, or vascular innervation).
&gt; | But, as we showed at the beginning of the discussion, no discharge
&gt; | of this kind can bring about any relief of tension, because endogenous
&gt; | stimuli continue to be received in spite of it and the Psi-tension is
&gt; | re-established.  Here a removal of the stimulus can only be effected
&gt; | by an intervention which will temporarily stop the release of quantity
&gt; | (Q-eta) in the interior of the body, and an intervention of this kind
&gt; | requires an alteration in the external world (e.g., the supply of
&gt; | nourishment or the proximity of the sexual object), and this, as
&gt; | a &quot;specific action&quot;, can only be brought about in particular ways.
&gt; | At early stages the human organism is incapable of achieving this
&gt; | specific action.  It is brought about by extraneous help, when the
&gt; | attention of an experienced person has been drawn to the child's
&gt; | condition by a discharge taking place along the path of internal
&gt; | change [e.g., by the child's screaming].  This path of discharge
&gt; | thus acquires an extremely important secondary function -- viz.,
&gt; | of bringing about an understanding with other people;  and the
&gt; | original helplessness of human beings is thus the primal source
&gt; | of all moral motives.
&gt; |
&gt; | When the extraneous helper has carried out the specific action in
&gt; | the external world on behalf of the helpless subject, the latter
&gt; | is in a position, by means of reflex contrivances, immediately
&gt; | to perform what is necessary in the interior of his body in
&gt; | order to remove the endogenous stimulus.  This total event
&gt; | then constitutes an &quot;experience of satisfaction&quot;, which
&gt; | has the most momentous consequences in the functional
&gt; | development of the individual.
&gt; |
&gt; | ...
&gt; |
&gt; | Thus the experience of satisfaction leads to a facilitation between
&gt; | the two memory-images [of the object wished-for and of the reflex
&gt; | movement] and the nuclear neurones which had been cathected during
&gt; | the state of urgency.  (No doubt, during [the actual course of]
&gt; | the discharge brought about by the satisfaction, the quantity
&gt; | (Q-eta) flows out of the memory-images as well.)  Now, when
&gt; | the state of urgency or wishing re-appears, the cathexis
&gt; | will pass also to the two memories and will activate
&gt; | 'them'.  And in all probability the memory-image of
&gt; | the object will be the first to experience this
&gt; | wishful activation.
&gt; |
&gt; | I have no doubt that the wishful activation will in the first
&gt; | instance produce something similar to a perception -- namely,
&gt; | a hallucination.  And if this leads to the performance of the
&gt; | reflex action, disappointment will inevitably follow.
