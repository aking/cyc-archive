&gt; I have waded through the collection of materials that you posted and
&gt; indeed can find one or two statements that resonate with my perception
&gt; of &quot;reification&quot; or &quot;hypostatic abstraction&quot; (they took some finding but
&gt; then, as you say &quot;JA: Four short paragraphs and I have already put myself
&gt; to sleep --&quot;!)

Believe me, I sympathize, but it is an important question,
however weighty the tomes that one needs to sift through,
and so worth the time that it takes to wrestle it down,
in terms of the appreciation of the formal beauty that
is locked within its compass -- not to mix metaphors
or anything.

&gt; In particular:
&gt; 
&gt; | Intuition is the regarding of the abstract in a concrete form,
&gt; | by the realistic hypostatization of relations;  that is the
&gt; | one sole method of valuable thought.  Very shallow is the
&gt; | prevalent notion that this is something to be avoided.
&gt; | You might as well say at once that reasoning is to
&gt; | be avoided because it has led to so much error;
&gt; | quite in the same philistine line of thought
&gt; | would that be;  and so well in accord with
&gt; | the spirit of nominalism that I wonder
&gt; | some one does not put it forward.
&gt; | The true precept is not to abstain
&gt; | from hypostatization, but to do it
&gt; | intelligently ... (CP 1.383).
&gt; |
&gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce, &quot;A Guess at the Riddle&quot;, circa 1890,
&gt; | 'Collected Papers', CP 1.354-416.
&gt; 
&gt; and:
&gt; 
&gt; | CP 4.332  [Subjectal Abstraction = Hypostatic Abstraction]
&gt; |
&gt; | ... The logical term 'subjectal abstraction' here requires a word
&gt; | of explanation;  for there are few treatises on logic which notice
&gt; | subjectal abstraction under any name, except so far as to confuse
&gt; | it with precisive abstraction which is an entirely different logical
&gt; | function.  When we say that the Columbia library building is 'large',
&gt; | this remark is a result of precisive abstraction by which the man who
&gt; | makes the remark leaves out of account all the other features of his
&gt; | image of the building, and takes [to represent the size] the word
&gt; | &quot;large&quot; which is entirely unlike that image -- and when I say the
&gt; | word is unlike the image, I mean that the general signification
&gt; | of the word is utterly disparate from the image, which involves
&gt; | no predicates at all.  Such is 'precisive abstraction'.  But now
&gt; | if this man goes on to remark that the largeness of the building is
&gt; | very impressive, he converts the applicability of that predicate from
&gt; | being a way of thinking about the building to being itself a subject
&gt; | of thought, and that operation is 'subjectal abstraction'.
&gt; |
&gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 4.332
&gt;
&gt; The RDF specification talks about reification in the following terms:
&gt; 
&gt; | Statements are made about resources.
&gt; | A model of a statement is the resource
&gt; | we need in order to be able to make new
&gt; | statements (higher-order statements)
&gt; | about the modeled statement.
&gt; |
&gt; | For example, let us consider the sentence
&gt; | |
&gt; | | Ora Lassila is the creator of the resource <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila">http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila</A>.
&gt; | |
&gt; | RDF would regard this sentence as a fact.  If, instead, we write the sentence
&gt; | |
&gt; | | Ralph Swick says that Ora Lassila is the creator of the resource
&gt; | | <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila">http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila</A>.
&gt; | |
&gt; | we have said nothing about the resource <A  HREF="http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila">http://www.w3.org/Home/Lassila</A>;
&gt; | instead, we have expressed a fact about a statement Ralph has made.
&gt; | In order to express this fact to RDF, we have to model the original
&gt; | statement as a resource with four properties.  This process is formally
&gt; | called reification in the Knowledge Representation community.  A model
&gt; | of a statement is called a reified statement.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems to me to fit in with CSP's notion of 'subjectal abstraction',
&gt; as indeed does the usage in the case of XTM (Topic Maps).

There are so many things that arise here that I do not know how to begin.
I guess a lot depends on the aims and the attitudes of those who would
create a new language, so maybe I will start by trying to assize that.
Are they trying to solve a problem that is ineffable in other terms?
Are they trying to prove that they are creative?  I would need to
get a sense of that first.

&gt; In the case of XTM the use of the term 'reification' had
&gt; been abandoned because of its perceived general misuse.
&gt; It came back into use at the Paris meeting (as indicated
&gt; by Steve Pepper) because it appeared to more accurately
&gt; reflect what part of the conceptual model needed to say.

Paris does that to people.

&gt; In a topic map topics exist, but the subjects that they
&gt; represent are themselves abstract (although they may have
&gt; physical manifestations).  We can form associations between
&gt; topics, we may also want to refer to some associations between
&gt; topics as if they were topics.  At a data modelling level this
&gt; can lead one to simply treat 'association between topics' as
&gt; a subclass of 'topic'.  But this leads to problems, in particular
&gt; it is not necessarily appropriate to have an association inherit
&gt; from topic because, in a general case, properties of a topic are
&gt; not all applicable in the case of an association.  What it really
&gt; comes down to is that the association can rank alongside other
&gt; subjects and can be converted to (or reified into) a topic.
&gt; The topic and the association are thus distinct and one is
&gt; not a subclass of the other.
&gt; 
&gt; To me the process of reification is that of converting
&gt; a statement (which is an abstraction) into a thing or
&gt; entity in its own right in order that it may become
&gt; the subject of some other statement.  It is often
&gt; the equivalent of the device of placing a statement
&gt; in single quotes in order to distinguish between that
&gt; part of a sentence that is in the metalanguage and that
&gt; which is in the object language.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think that I am 'barking up the wrong tree'?

My current guess is that almost every word of length greater than five
in your account is being used with sense that I do not know, nor could
easily guess, so that would take some raking over to see what is meant.

Tomorrow ...

Jon
