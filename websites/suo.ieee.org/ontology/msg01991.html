Phil,

Thanks for bringing that quotation into the fray.  I believe
that I am using the word "proposition" in a way that is quite
consistent with Peirce's usage:

&gt;"But even if it were impossible to distinguish between truth and reality,
&gt;that would not in the least prevent our defining what it is that truth
&gt;consists in. Truth and falsity are characters confined to propositions.  A

&gt;proposition is a sign which separately indicates its object.

Peirce is explicitly saying that a proposition is a sign.
But CSP elsewhere drew a distinction between a sign instance,
such as an occurrence of the word "the", and a sign type, such
as the word "the" as the syntactic form of a sign.  Both of
them are, according to CSP, signs.

For my definition of meaning-preserving translation (MPT),
I defined a proposition as an equivalence class of sentences.
Each sentence, as uttered, is a sign instance.  Each sentence
as a syntactic construct is a sign type.  My propositions are
a class of sign types in one or more languages.  That class
represents the supertype of all the sign types that have the
same interpretants in all those languages.  It too is a sign
type.

&gt;Thus, a
&gt;portrait with the name of the original below it is a proposition. It asserts

&gt;that if anybody looks at it, he can form a reasonably correct idea of how
&gt;the original looked.

Note that a portrait by itself would not be a proposition
because there would be no indication of its object.  The
addition of the name plus the convention that a name below
a portrait indicates the name of the person portrayed adds
the necessary connection between the form (picture) and the
object (person).  That is why I require condition #3 of
vocabulary preserving in my definition of MPT.  Without
that condition, one could claim that the following three
sentences "express the same proposition":

 1. "Every cat is a cat."

 2. "Every dog is a dog."

 3. "Every unicorn is a unicorn."

All three of these sentences have the same logical form,
and all three would have the denotation true in every
possible world.  But their content words have different
referents (and "unicorn" has no referent in our world).

&gt;A sign is only a sign in actu by virtue of its
&gt;receiving an interpretation, that is, by virtue of its determining another

&gt;sign of the same object. This is as true of mental judgments as it is of
&gt;external signs. To say that a proposition is true is to say that every
&gt;interpretation of it is true. Two propositions are equivalent when either
&gt;might have been an interpretant of the other.

Exactly.  A proposition, as I defined it, is a supertype
of equivalent propositions as stated in multiple languages.

&gt; This equivalence, like others,
&gt;is by an act of abstraction (in the sense in which forming an abstract noun

&gt;is abstraction) conceived as identity. And we speak of believing in a
&gt;proposition, having in mind an entire collection of equivalent propositions

&gt;with their partial interpretants.

I couldn't have said it better.

&gt; Thus, two persons are said to have the
&gt;same proposition in mind. The interpretant of a proposition is itself a
&gt;proposition. Any necessary inference from a proposition is an interpretant

&gt;of it.

Indeed.  That is condition #2 of proof preserving for an MPT.

&gt; When we speak of truth and falsity, we refer to the possibility of
&gt;the proposition being refuted; and this refutation (roughly speaking) takes

&gt;place in but one way. Namely, an interpretant of the proposition would, if

&gt;believed, produce the expectation of a certain description of percept on a

&gt;certain occasion. The occasion arrives: the percept forced upon us is
&gt;different. This constitutes the falsity of every proposition of which the
&gt;disappointing prediction was the interpretant.	Thus, a false proposition is

&gt;a proposition of which some interpretant represents that, on an occasion
&gt;which it indicates, a percept will have a certain character, while the
&gt;immediate perceptual judgment on that occasion is that the percept has not

&gt;that character. A true proposition is a proposition belief in which would
&gt;never lead to such disappointment so long as the proposition is not
&gt;understood otherwise than it was intended." CP 5:569

&gt;&gt; Okay, I will try to remember that you talk this way.
&gt;&gt; The way I see it, however, your translation of what you
&gt;&gt; describe as "Peirce's informal statement" into formal terms
&gt;&gt; is a translation that alters significant aspects of its meaning.

What "significant aspects" do you claim I have altered?
Perhaps I should have been more precise in saying that
a proposition is "a supertypere" of all the sign types in
the equivalence class instead of saying that it "is" the
equivalence class.  But since a supertype of a type of s
is itself a type of s, a proposition is also a sign type.

I'll revise my previous definition to say that a
proposition is the supertype of all the sentence types
in several different languages that are in the same
equivalence class, as determined by some MPT.
