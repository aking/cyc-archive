Along the lines of this discussion, here are some further comments:

It is tempting to say that if we restrict "Language" to verbal or written,
serial human natural languages such as English, Chinese, etc., then thought
is possible without language: People can solve some kinds of problems using
reasoning (e.g. "spatial reasoning") and perception that are at least not
easy to express in English, etc. People can display intelligence and
thinking even if they haven't learned a language such as English, etc.
Pinker ("The Language Instinct", 1994) cites a list of very incisive
experiments that show conclusively that thought and intelligence are not
identical to the ability to understand spoken, natural languages:

A variety of psychological experiments show that babies can do various kinds
of thinking before they can speak.
People who suffer strokes may have impairments to use of natural language,
yet otherwise still be in possession of their faculties, and able to think.
An (apparently genetic) impairment called "Specific Language Impairment" can
impede use of natural language, yet leave the rest of intelligence intact.
Conversely, some people are "linguistic idiot savants" -- very good at using
language, yet may be intellectually impaired. This may occur as a result of
a variety of diseases, including hydrocephalus, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's
disease, autism, Williams syndrome, and aphasia.
Pinker also argues strongly against the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis" that
language determines and limits our thinking abilities, providing a variety
of arguments and evidence to refute a strict interpretation of Sapir-Whorf.

On the other hand, there is an elegant argument that concepts must be
expressed as sentences in a mental language (viz. Jackendoff, "Languages of
the Mind", 1995), based on the apparently unlimited number of sentences that
can be expressed in natural language: Since natural language sentences can
describe concepts, and the brain is finite, we cannot suppose that all
possible concepts are stored as "atomic" propositions, pre-existing in the
brain. This implies that concepts must be represented internally within the
mind as structures within a combinatorial system, i.e. a language of some
sort.

So, despite the evidence and arguments against thought being based on spoken
natural languages, it seems clear that human intelligence must rely on an
internal language for thinking, a "mentalese" distinct from spoken natural
languages.

In this case, spoken natural languages would be ways of "serializing"
mentalese concepts for communication between people. The psychological
experiments cited against the equivalence of natural language and thought
may show cases where the mechanisms for spoken language are impaired, while
the mechanisms for mentalese continue to function, or vice versa.

The expressive capabilities of languages like English may reflect the
expressive capabilities of mentalese. The ability to express arbitrarily
large, recursively structured sentences is plausibly just as important in a
mentalese as it is in English. The ability to metaphorically weld concepts
together across arbitrary, multiple domains may plausibly be just as
important in a mentalese as it is in English.

This is not to say that mentalese would have the same limitations as spoken
natural languages. Perhaps in mentalese, sentences can have more complex,
non-sequential, graphical structures not physically permitted in spoken
languages, which might make mentalese more expressive for problems involving
spatial reasoning, etc. Perhaps in mentalese sentences can more clearly
express the kinds of logical precision possible in formal languages like
predicate calculus.

The study of natural language may yield some very important clues about how
concepts are represented and processed by humans. For example, consider the
interrelated problems of disambiguating polysemy and parsing natural
language sentences. How do humans overcome the exponential explosion of
possible sentence parses (which is a major problem for computational
linguistics), in view of the fact that the most highly polysemous words are
also the words used most frequently in discourse? (I like to think of this
as the "paradox of polysemy".)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Pat,
&gt;
&gt; Just a couple of quick comments:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;My basic grumble is that there seems to be a widespread assumption
&gt; &gt;that it is just kind of obvious that linguistic data is
&gt; relevant to
&gt; &gt;ontology design.
&gt;
&gt; I think that NL is "obviously" relevant, but I don't think that
&gt; it is at all "obvious" in what way it might be relevant.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I think that for an inference-supporting ontology
&gt; &gt;this view is extremely naive, based on very daft assumptions
&gt; (such as
&gt; &gt;the idea the people think in natural language) and more likely to
&gt; &gt;cause trouble than to be of use, in practice.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody who claims to understand how people think is a crank.
&gt; That is especially true of anybody who claims that their own
&gt; particular theory, device, notation, program, or whatever
&gt; "thinks the way humans do".
&gt;
&gt; And by saying that, I do not imply that studying psychology,
&gt; linguistics, or psycholinguistics is a waste of time.  On the
&gt; contrary, the more you study those subjects the better you
&gt; understand how little you understand about how humans understand.
&gt;
&gt; For more on this point, see my review of the book by Lakoff
&gt; and Johnson, Philosophy in the Flesh:
