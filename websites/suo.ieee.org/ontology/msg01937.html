&gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; I have time so I will bite on this one.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; x is in n.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I'm assuming you are making a point like "no man is an island"?

Well, no, I used to work in Galveston, so I know better.
But yes, in spirit, if you mean the bells that toll for
all of us sooner or later, and still more timely, those
signs in our minds by which we tell each other the tale
of our time in the mean time, then, yes, most decidedly,
for what I mean to tell you by and by thereby is simply
the story that you already know, that a sign that binds
covalently and auto-dyadically to its object is a petty,
inhuman form of bondage, one that leaves no room at all
for any agent or community of interrupretation to enter
or to intervene in the dramas of eventual understanding.

&gt; If so I couldn't agree more of course.
&gt; To say anything even remotely intelligible
&gt; I expect to need something like 100 simple
&gt; statements like the one above.
&gt; 
&gt; What is x?
&gt; What is n?
&gt; What is "in"?
&gt; 
&gt; never mind a, b and what bounding might be, and why did you think
&gt; it worth noting in the first place, and who noted it when and where.
&gt; 
&gt; So it isn't that I think you can say something coherent
&gt; with just one binary relation.  I also don't think you
&gt; can say something coherent with a tertiary relation,
&gt; not by a long chalk (remember Graham's attempt to
&gt; write an unambiguous sentence?)

The part of me that still cares about getting the formal analysis right,
because I know it to be one of those discernments that really does make
a difference -- for instance, the next time that I get down to trying
to write a program that really works, and that really really runs --
is still concerned to point out that, however many 2-adic relation
expressions you may seek to chain together to express something
seamingly more complex, whether by relational composition or
else by various forms of logical connectives, you are going
to be conducting your activities of analysis and synthesis
within a 3-adic relation at minimum, and to that extent
participating in, thus quite literally taking part in,
a 3-adic transaction.  Reflecting on this aspect of
the total analytic situation is simply a condition
of accurate description of what is going on in the
ongoing process of analysis and/or synthesis, and
a failure to analyze its own hidden assumptions
and its own operative ground rules would amount
to a failure of the analytic intention itself,
a failure to complete its mission such as we
still find enshrined in one or another sect
of easier-said-than-done "analytic schools".

&gt; So the point about 2 or 3 is really a representation issue
&gt; as I see it, and then a matter of whether you think you are
&gt; talking about edges or nodes.

We may have to leave aside the graph theoretic morphisms
until such time as we come to see their fit applications.
In the mean time, we can always return to the subject of
relations themselves, exploiting many different pictures
and representations, but privileging none above the rest.

Let me draw your attention to an aspect of the analysis,
lately led, that I carried out for a case of Betweening:

&gt; Putting all of these pieces together, we have this picture:
&gt; 
&gt;           lt(a, x)  .       .  lt(x, b)
&gt;                     |       |
&gt;                     |       |
&gt;             te&lt;21&gt;  o       o  te&lt;13&gt;
&gt;                     |       |
&gt;                     |       |
&gt;    lt&lt;21&gt;(x, a, b)  .       .  lt&lt;13&gt;(x, a, b)
&gt;                      \     /
&gt;                       \   /
&gt;                        \ /
&gt;                       [and]
&gt;                         |
&gt;                         |
&gt;                         |
&gt;                         .
&gt;                  io&lt;213&gt;(x, a, b)
&gt; 
&gt; This gives a functional decomposition of the proposition io&lt;213&gt;
&gt; making use of two different applications of the proposition lt,
&gt; a couple of tacit extensions te&lt;21&gt; and te&lt;13&gt;, and the reusable
&gt; function 'and' that connects the tacit extensions of lt together.
&gt; 
&gt; What is the use of all of this? -- especially in view of the fact
&gt; that we did not reduce the maximum arity of the relations involved?
&gt; 
&gt; In sum, we started with a 3-adic relation map  io&lt;213&gt; : R^3 -&gt; B,
&gt; getting a pair of 2-adic relation maps of the form  lt : R^2 -&gt; B,
&gt; plus two tacit extensions of the form  te : (R^2 -&gt; B)  -&gt;  (R^3 -&gt; B),
&gt; and a 3-adic relation of the shape  'and' : (R^3 -&gt; B)^2 -&gt; (R^3 -&gt; B).
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the advantage, over the long haul, comes precisely from the fact
&gt; that the seemingly more complex pieces that we reached in the analysis
&gt; are pieces that are highly reusable in situation after situation, and
&gt; so it is worth the overhead, eventually, that it takes to understand
&gt; these recurring components as thoroughly as possible.

The function io&lt;213&gt; : R^3 -&gt; B, in applications of the form
"io&lt;213&gt;(x, a, b)" enunicated as "in order 213 of x, a, b",
is known as the "indicator function" or the "relation map"
of the corresponding relation IO&lt;213&gt; c R^3, where the
correspondence is given by IO&lt;213&gt; = (io&lt;213&gt;^(-1))(1),
in other words, the 3-tuples in IO&lt;213&gt; are those for
which the function io&lt;213&gt; evaluates to 1 in B, and
still other words, the "fiber" or "level set" of 1.

Let us dub this form of analysis "Ockham's Spatula" or "Ockham's Squeegee".
It is not so absolutely Teflon^(c)-ish as to avoid having residual bits of
3-adic relations stick to the working edges of all appliance and appliqued
surfaces of work -- perhaps only the artists-slash-wrappers phonetically
known as "M&amp;M" and "(R R)" could constitute such self-reverential forms
of "authenticity" and "authority", respectfully, for a' that -- but it
does allow us to nudge the tribling 3-adicity down to trifling corners
of the overall work area, and there is indeed a non-trivial brand of
implemental utility in being able to do that.

Nuf Fer Now,

Jon Awbrey
