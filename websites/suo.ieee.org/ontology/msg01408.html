Dear Jon,

&gt; I promised myself
&gt; then and there that I would never go humbly again --
&gt; that is to say, to so docily surrender my whole way
&gt; of being and living and thinking to whatever form
&gt; of authoritarian dogma that somebody judged was
&gt; the right grade of pablum to be parceling out
&gt; to me at a given age and estimated station.

And I will stand shoulder to shoulder with you.

However, I don't detect this problem here. I detect here a respect for
different viewpoints, and a desire to understand how they relate to each
other.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; &gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; We ought to be very careful about identifying mutually exclusive
&gt; &gt; &gt; options, especially, very wary of POV's that present themselves as
&gt; &gt; &gt; Either-Or's whenever it is conceivable they merely gloss different
&gt; &gt; &gt; facets of the same object, subject, topic, or whatever, 
&gt; as this has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been one of the places, historically and hysterically 
&gt; speaking, where
&gt; &gt; &gt; we have wasted the most time, that is, assuming that at 
&gt; least some of
&gt; &gt; &gt; it could have been avoided, which is a good question for 
&gt; such as us.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  A good point worth clarifying.  In my view a choice
&gt; &gt;      is required just when failure to make a choice leads to
&gt; &gt;      a logical contradiction, and that is the test I would be
&gt; &gt;      looking for (at least as a starting position).  Choices
&gt; &gt;      of course only apply within a particular point of view.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Again, we have to be extremely careful, because all of these POV's
&gt; have been well "worked over" in point of time and history, and those
&gt; who seek a distinctive position are well-schooled in all of the ways
&gt; to "sharpen up" a position to the point where, in its unnaturally
&gt; idealized, idolized, idle-ized, idyllized form, it may appear to
&gt; involve a contradiction with what are really its complementary
&gt; and its supplementary positions.  I guess that I will always
&gt; return to the days when I had to work through the fuss over
&gt; particles versus waves, since this was the mess that most
&gt; impressed me when I first had to make my eigen-transition
&gt; from the classical way of thinking, that had been burned
&gt; into my impressionable brain by my high school teachers,
&gt; to the "relativistic and quantum mechanical" (RAQM) way
&gt; that I had to learn as a fresh-person at the university.
&gt; What I discovered, after much distraction and grief and
&gt; the long dark night of the soul, was that the RAQM way
&gt; of thought had really been my natural way of thinking
&gt; all along, that is, before my grammar school teachers
&gt; had burned it out of my brain, and I promised myself
&gt; then and there that I would never go humbly again --
&gt; that is to say, to so docily surrender my whole way
&gt; of being and living and thinking to whatever form
&gt; of authoritarian dogma that somebody judged was
&gt; the right grade of pablum to be parceling out
&gt; to me at a given age and estimated station.
&gt; 
&gt; So There!
