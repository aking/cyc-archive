Dear Jon,

&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Finding myself with a spare half hour,
&gt; I will try to see if I can address some
&gt; of the remaining points in your last note.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  One reason I am pursuing this discussion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      is that if there really are things it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      cannot handle, I would really like
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      to know.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I always take people at their word,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I take you really to want to know:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The POV that you have been exposing here
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information contained in their apt expressions.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The "Pat Hayes Universal Change Of Variables Formula" (PHUCOVF)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that nobody ever meant to say what some people once pretended
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it said, as have you also in regard to a co-indited point.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned 
&gt; Pat's proof,
&gt; &gt; &gt;      but I am not sufficiently versed in these things to 
&gt; be sure that
&gt; &gt; &gt;      you are not employing the same kinds of tricks that 
&gt; you claim Pat
&gt; &gt; &gt;      has employed.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, at least we agree that some form of distracting prestidigitation
&gt; is involved, and it remains but to see who is raveling up their sleeve
&gt; and who is trying to dispell the spell of this sleight 
&gt; transliteration.

MW: I only see claims of such so far.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; So I'm afraid that is not an arguement that will
&gt; &gt; &gt; convince me on its own.  If you wish to do that
&gt; &gt; &gt; you will have to present a specific example of
&gt; &gt; &gt; where the information in some triadic relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot be transformed into some set of binary
&gt; &gt; &gt; relations.  If you provide the triadic relation,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will provide the binary relations from which the
&gt; &gt; &gt; triadic relation can be constructed (or not and admit
&gt; &gt; &gt; you are right).
&gt; 
&gt; Once again, I have provided you not only with specific definitions
&gt; of the two most common forms of reduction that are usually met with
&gt; in this context, but I have given many examples of 3-adic relations,
&gt; indicating how they fall out with respect to these two typical FOA's.

MW: and for these types of reduction I agree with you. But you do not
describe what I do (and countless people working in datbase land do 
daily).

&gt; I have now contributed to this working group what approaches a small
&gt; monograph on this topic, and I have just condensed and edited these
&gt; notes into a single essay on the "Reductions Among Relations" thread.
&gt; So far, nobody else has even defined another type of decomposition --
&gt; I do not yet recognize the "transliteration" that Pat put forth as
&gt; being up to the mark on that score -- and nobody else has provided
&gt; any extensional examples of relations, which most people who look
&gt; into it long enough find are best when it comes to settling these
&gt; sorts of questions in any concrete and definitive way.  If people
&gt; prefer to continue with intensional examples then it is incumbent
&gt; on them to provide explicit definitions of these relations, but
&gt; so far I have just not seen any being 'given' for the 'taking',
&gt; if you will.

MW: OK well let me first try to state a method, you will have to 
forgive some lack of formality, but it should not be so unclear what
I mean. Where I come from this method would be informally  known as
reification.

Purpose:

To take any n-adic relation occurence and turn it into n binary 
relations without loss of meaning.

Method:

Create an object (say x) that stands for the n-adic relation as a 
whole.

Take each each element in the relation occurance and create a
relation between it and x. Use the role that the element plays
in the original relation to name this binary relation.

Example:

(&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary Book1)
     (and (gives x)
          (giver John)
          (receiver Mary)
          (given book1)
     )
)

(probably flakey, but I hope intelligible.)

Regards  
      Matthew
