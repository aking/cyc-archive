&gt;Hi everybody, I am monitoring only sporadically this discussion, 
&gt;saving my (MANY) comments for a future time [I am working on a paper 
&gt;for the SUO workshop right now...]
&gt;
&gt;But I can't avoid making a strong WARNING here:
&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; [snip]
&gt;&gt; &gt; Ian suggests that "there is no overlap between ContinuantType and
&gt;&gt;&gt;OccurrentType. I think this needs clarification. If one is an
&gt;&gt;&gt;extensionalist, one would typically identify a thing with its
&gt;&gt;&gt;life (they
&gt;&gt;&gt;have exactly the same spatio-temporal (and modal) extension). So the
&gt;&gt;&gt;property of being a human life and being human would be the
&gt;&gt;&gt;same property
&gt;&gt;&gt;(as they have the same extension). So body-type and
&gt;&gt;&gt;event-type would not be
&gt;&gt;&gt;disjoint. However a non-extensionalist (such as an
&gt;&gt; &gt; endurantist) may prefer a
&gt;&gt; &gt; scheme where these were disjoint. It maybe useful if the SUO
&gt;&gt; &gt; strategy vis a
&gt;&gt; &gt; vis extensionalism were clarified (some baggage comes, of
&gt;&gt; &gt; course, with KIF).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is a good point.  If we included 'Human' under 'ContinuantType' and
&gt;&gt;'Human-Life' under 'OccurrentType' in the merged ontology, then we would
&gt;&gt;violate the disjointness condition on ContinuantType/OccurrentType, because
&gt;&gt;'Human' and 'Human-Life' are co-extensional and we are assuming an
&gt;&gt;extensional interpretation of SUO-KIF.
&gt;
&gt;WARNING!!! you are using the adjective "extensional" in two 
&gt;different senses here:
&gt;
&gt;The SUO-KIF is "extensional" in the sense that it has a standard 
&gt;(Tarskian) semantics (that is, roughly, predicates denote sets). So 
&gt;the "extension" of a predicate is a particular set of elements of 
&gt;the domain. Two predicates are coextensional if they denote the same 
&gt;set.
&gt;
&gt;In Chris Partridge's comments, an extension is a spatio-temporal 
&gt;entity. Two entities are coextensional iff they have the same 
&gt;spatio-temporal extension.
&gt;
&gt;In the former case we are talking about predicates (universals), in 
&gt;the latter we are talking about particulars (instances of 
&gt;universals).
&gt;
&gt;So there is no contradiction at all in including Human under 
&gt;ContinuantType and HumanLife under OccurrentType, as long as we 
&gt;assume that a person and its life are different.

But if we make that assumption, then we could make do with Continuant 
and Occurrent, and we don't need the 'types'.  They were introduced 
precisely so that we would NOT be forced into making that kind of 
distinction.

&gt;Even if we assume that they have the same spatio-temporal extension, 
&gt;the contradiction only arises if we assume that two things are the 
&gt;same iff they have the same spatio-temporal extension.

Yes, but that seems like an excellent principle to adopt, at least 
for physical reasoning. (Actually I think it is a good principle for 
most reasoning, and it is central to much of law - particularly 
evidential reasoning in criminal law -  physics,  biology, 
engineering, virtually all of the sciences, geography, etc..) I know 
you don't adopt it, but the result is that your ontological 
principles require one to multiply entities to an alarming extent, 
distinguishing for example two relations which are extensionally 
identical on the grounds that they *might* have had different 
extensions in some other world, to distinguish the stuff in a river 
from the water in the river, to distinguish the water in a lake from 
the water flowing through the lake, and to distinguish a thing from 
its lifetime, and on and on. Basically, everything has to be 
distinguished, more or less, by how it is thought of as well as what 
it actually is. All to satisfy some a priori philosophical scruples 
which arise from natural-langauge philosophy.

&gt;So the reason of the contradiction is the extensionality principle 
&gt;(for those who assume it! - I don't), not the extensionality of 
&gt;SUO-KIF. Unfortunately, these two uses of the term "extensionality" 
&gt;are completely different.

You are right, they are distinct notions. One could have an 
SUO-KIF-extensional theory of intensions, in fact, if you really want 
to have intensions as entities in your world. But I object to having 
an intensional distinction welded into the upper levels of the SUO 
heirarchy, where it will obstruct and confuse everything below it.
