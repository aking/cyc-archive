Dear Jon,

I note your frustration, it is reciprocated, but I really can't 
work anything more out from what you choose to say.

Regards

&gt; &gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have read what follows, and understood (I think) about 2/3.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My problem is that you are taking a way of turning triadic relations
&gt; &gt; into dyadic relations that I would not take, showing that it is not
&gt; &gt; sensible (I agree) and then concluding that because this way doesn't
&gt; &gt; work, you can't do it at all.  Where as in reality you have 
&gt; only shown
&gt; &gt; that this way doesn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; Across my several notes on this subject, I have illustrated 
&gt; in some detail
&gt; two of the most common ways that folks from maths to database 
&gt; applications
&gt; understand the problem of decomposing relations -- no, not 
&gt; you, Uncle Jack!
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, of course, one can think of many others.  DeMorgan, 
&gt; Peirce &amp; Company,
&gt; Schroeder, and hordes of crafty hobbyists and logicians came 
&gt; up with more
&gt; than I can easily remember -- it was almost a cottage 
&gt; industry in the mid
&gt; to late 19th Century.  And one of the first chores that 
&gt; Peirce labored on
&gt; was to plot out a rational classification of most of the 
&gt; operations worth
&gt; bothering about.  And most post*modern logicians will tell 
&gt; you, with nary
&gt; a blink or a tear of the eye, how God's Own Modern 
&gt; Quantificational Logic
&gt; absorbed each and every barrel'o'monkeys, kettle'o'fish, 
&gt; tin'o'worms, and
&gt; assimilated the entire Locke Stock Kif^N^Kaboodle Motley Crew 
&gt; of Algebras
&gt; into its "Grand Amalgamated Smelting Pot" (GASP) -- and to a 
&gt; lion's share
&gt; that is true.
&gt; 
&gt; But there is one thing that is true of every one of these 
&gt; actual or alleged,
&gt; genuine or ostensible, computative or reputative "forms of 
&gt; analysis" (FOA's),
&gt; and that is that each of them participates in -- "takes part 
&gt; in" -- a form of
&gt; triadic relation, which is the "archetype" or the generic 
&gt; form of all analysis
&gt; itself, apart from all of its specific or specious details, 
&gt; and thus, as I have
&gt; emphasized, time and time again, and merely by way of but 
&gt; feebly attempting to
&gt; reinforce the sheer observation of this shear that Peirce 
&gt; already made, this
&gt; argument was done with from the very moment that it began, 
&gt; and we have only
&gt; been haggling about the price of our pro-analytic 
&gt; constitutional hierachy.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I feel rather as I have done on some previous occassions
&gt; &gt; that I have been gagged and am only allowed to utter the
&gt; &gt; words that you put there because that is all I am allowed
&gt; &gt; to have meant.
&gt; 
&gt; All that I have done is to follow up the logical consequences 
&gt; of what you say.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let me take something from below as an example.
&gt; 
&gt; Please understand, from my POV, you have not yet GIVEN me even
&gt; a single example of a 3-adic relation, except for these things
&gt; that you call "examples", which are only what I consider to be
&gt; "elementary relations", that is, single elements of speculated
&gt; relations, or lone k-tuples of length k = 3.  There is just no
&gt; significant extent of relation to be found in such a construct,
&gt; except insofar as I or you or somebody or other imagines it to
&gt; be so, and my experience GIVES me to know that the imagination
&gt; of humans and others is a vast and diverse realm of imaginings.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If we have "John gave the flue to Mary" you argue that
&gt; &gt; this is an irreducibly triadic relation of the form:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Gives &lt;John, Flue, Mary&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, I would never even call what you just GAVE a "relation",
&gt; except perhaps to play along, which I begin to see has been a mistake,
&gt; and so I will now formally cease to do it.  Since I have provided you
&gt; with concrete examples of 3-adic relations, and you have GIVEN me not
&gt; a one, I will defer further discussion until you think to reciprocate.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I on the other hand put my analysts hat on and say:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is an object missing.  There is an activity
&gt; &gt; going on which I can recognise as another object,
&gt; &gt; say g, which is a member of the Gives class (if
&gt; &gt; I were being more precise I would describe this
&gt; &gt; as a physical transfer, but gives will do here).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are 3 objects that are each involved in
&gt; &gt; this activity with different roles to play:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Giver &lt;g, John&gt;
&gt; &gt; Given &lt;g, Flue&gt;
&gt; &gt; Receiver &lt;g, Mary&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; What GIVES here?
&gt; 
&gt; What connects the three lines of syntax that you just GAVE?
&gt; 
&gt; And while I am at it, what interpretation do you GIVE them?
&gt; Do you mean to GIVE them to me as mere strings of letters?
&gt; Or do you mean to GIVE me some meaning by means of them?
&gt; I can only tell you that it is not GIVEN what you mean.
&gt; It is not GIVEN what binds those letters together.
&gt; It is not GIVEN what meaning they will have to me.
&gt; It is not GIVEN what bearing they deliver to life.
&gt; If one desires to GIVE anybody any of these things,
&gt; then GIFT, GIVEE, GIVER must bear an intact relation,
&gt; and that relation, which begins to wish that it had
&gt; renamed nameless, is just not GIVEN a means of life
&gt; by the putative "analysis" that dices it to die-ads.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now from this (for those who want things triadic)
&gt; &gt; I can easily generate the original relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Only because you have obligingly kept all of these bits,
&gt; all of these sliced and diced ingredients, together and
&gt; warm in that oven of your mind at one and the same time,
&gt; a mind like all minds that is, at the very least, roomy
&gt; enough to bond TWO pieces to make ONE whole, and I know,
&gt; also, a mind farseeing enough to see the punchline that
&gt; has been chugging along all the while, on its merry way
&gt; to the "Ultimate Reception" (UR):  ONE plus TWO = THREE.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the other hand, on the second occasion that
&gt; &gt; John gives the flue to Mary, you might have
&gt; &gt; difficulty in distinguishing between the
&gt; &gt; two occassions.  This rather leads me
&gt; &gt; to think that my analysis provides
&gt; &gt; an improved result.
&gt; 
&gt; Try to think about what binds our occasions together.
&gt; 
&gt; Another Time,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
