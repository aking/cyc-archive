From:  Jon Awbrey &lt;jawbrey@oakland.edu&gt;
  To:  Peirce Discussion Forum &lt;peirce-l@lyris.acs.ttu.edu&gt;

|    It appears to me, then, that my three cotary propositions
| are satisfactorily grounded.  Nevertheless, since others may not
| regard them as so certain as I myself do, I propose in the first
| instance to disregard them, and to show that, even if they are put
| aside as doubtful, a maxim practically little differing in most of
| its applications from that of pragmatism ought to be acknowledged
| and followed;  and after this has been done, I will show how the
| recognition of the cotary propositions will affect the matter.
| 
|    I have argued in several of my early papers that there are
| but three essentially different modes of reasoning:  Deduction,
| Induction, and Abduction.  I may mention in particular papers in
| the 'Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'
| for April and May 1867.  I must say, however, that it would be
| very easy to misunderstand those arguments.  I did not at first
| fully comprehend them myself.  I cannot restate the matter tonight,
| although I am very desirous of doing so, for I could now put it
| in a much clearer light.  I have already explained to you briefly
| what these three modes of inference, Deduction, Induction, and
| Abduction are.  I ought to say that when I described induction
| as the experimental testing of a hypothesis, I was not thinking
| of experimentation in the narrow sense in which it is confined
| to cases in which we ourselves deliberately create the peculiar
| conditions under which we desire to study a phenomenon.  I mean
| to extend it to every case in which, having ascertained by
| deduction that a theory would lead us to anticipate under
| certain circumstances phenomena contrary to what we should
| expect if the theory were 'not' true, we examine the cases of
| that sort to see how far those predictions are borne out.
| (LOP 1903:  PAT, 248-249;  excerpt at CP 5.195).
|
|    If you carefully consider the question of pragmatism you will see
| that it is nothing else than the question of the logic of abduction.
| That is, pragmatism proposes a certain maxim which, if sound, must
| render needless any further rule as to the admissibility of hypotheses
| to rank as hypotheses, that is to say, as explanations of phenomena
| held as hopeful suggestions;  and furthermore, this is 'all' that the
| maxim of pragmatism really pretends to do, at least so far as it is
| confined to logic, and is not understood as a proposition in psychology.
| For the maxim of pragmatism is that a conception can have no logical
| effect or import differing from that of a second conception except so
| far as, taken in connection with other conceptions and intentions, it
| might conceivably modify our practical conduct differently from that
| second conception.  Now it is indisputable that no rule of abduction
| would be admitted by any philosopher which should prohibit on any
| formalistic grounds any inquiry as to how we ought in consistency
| to shape our practical conduct.  Therefore, a maxim which looks only
| to possibly practical considerations will not need any supplement in
| order to exclude any hypotheses as inadmissible.  What hypothesis it
| admits all philosophers would agree ought to be admitted.  On the
| other hand, if it be true that nothing but such considerations has
| any logical effect or import whatever, it is plain that the maxim
| of pragmatism cannot cut off any kind of hypothesis which ought to
| be admitted.  Thus, the maxim of pragmatism, if true, fully 'covers'
| the entire logic of abduction.  It remains to inquire whether this
| maxim may not have some 'further' logical effect.  If so, it must in
| some way affect inductive or deductive inference.  But that pragmatism
| cannot interfere with induction is evident;  because induction simply
| teaches us what we have to expect as a result of experimentation, and
| it is plain that any such expectation may conceivably concern practical
| conduct.  In a certain sense it must affect deduction.  Anything which
| gives a rule to abduction and so puts a limit upon admissible hypotheses
| will cut down 'the premisses' of deduction, and thereby will render a
| 'reductio ad absurdum' and other equivalent forms of deduction possible
| which would not otherwise have been possible.  But here three remarks
| may be made.  First, to affect the premisses of deduction is not to
| affect the logic of deduction.  For in the process of deduction itself
| no conception is introduced to which pragmatism could be supposed to
| object except the act of abstraction.  Concerning that I have only time
| to say that pragmatism ought not to object to it.  Secondly, no effect
| of pragmatism which 'is consequent upon its effect on abduction' can
| go to show that pragmatism is anything more than a doctrine concerning
| the logic of abduction.  Thirdly, if pragmatism is the doctrine that
| every conception is a conception of conceivable practical effects,
| it makes conception reach far beyond the practical.  It allows any
| flight of imagination, provided this imagination ultimately alights
| upon a possible practical effect;  and thus many hypotheses may seem
| at first glance to be excluded by the pragmatical maxim that are not
| really so excluded.  (LOP 1903:  PAT, 249-250;  CP 5.196).
