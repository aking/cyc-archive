&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a similar problem understanding the following 
&gt; categories. In
&gt; &gt; &gt; any sense of 'relation' I understand, it doesn't make sense to say
&gt; &gt; &gt; that a relation is either a continuant or an occurent. Relations
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't exist through time, they hold between entities. So what do
&gt; &gt; &gt; these categories even mean?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Well I agree that is how relations should be used, but take the
&gt; &gt;relation:
&gt; &gt;(married Matthew Lydia)
&gt; &gt;This does not hold for all time.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, in my logic, if you say it like that it DOES hold for all time, 
&gt; so you said the wrong thing. People write things like this because it 
&gt; reads like the English sentence "Matthew and Linda are married", 
&gt; forgetting that English sentences are always spoken with an implicit 
&gt; 'now' (and often an implicit 'here' or 'this way' as well), and since 
&gt; our logical languages are not indexical, we need to somehow make all 
&gt; this implicit stuff explicit.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Of course the problem is that people are
&gt; &gt;modelling the wrong thing, but what some people do (and I 
&gt; have done - not
&gt; &gt;now recommended) is to add some temporal information to the 
&gt; relation, so
&gt; &gt;something like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(married Matthew Lydia 3-Jul-1976 present) (yes 25 years coming up)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So what is this? You could call it a temporal relationship. There are
&gt; &gt;(believe me) worse things that people do.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(Of course it really represents the state of Matthew and the 
&gt; state of Lydia
&gt; &gt;from 3-Jul-1976 to the present, and a timeless relation 
&gt; between them, but
&gt; &gt;that is several steps away from what is represented here, 
&gt; which seems to be
&gt; &gt;a relationship that is also a spatio-temporal extent.)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I agree that people do all these things. People also lay 
&gt; landmines, but it shouldnt be encouraged.
&gt; I think the 'nonrecommended' temporal-parameter has its uses, but 
&gt; should be thought of as an abbreviation for the 4-d temporal-slices 
&gt; version, which I agree is the most general formulation.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Assembly "A CorpuscularObject whose 
&gt; discrete parts are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;completely separable.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What does 'completely separable' mean? (I can have the paint
&gt; &gt; &gt; sandblasted off my car: is it therefore completely separable?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: OK here I will come to Ian's defence. I am sure what Ian means is
&gt; &gt;something that can be taken apart and put back together 
&gt; again repeatedly
&gt; &gt;without damage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So the paint is not separable from your car, because it 
&gt; can't be reassembled
&gt; &gt;(or at least only with extreme difficulty).
&gt; 
&gt; OK, that makes sense, but it isnt consistent with what is underneath 
&gt; 'cospuscular' If you look later, you will see for example that 
&gt; 'Organic' is under 'corpuscular'. A butcher can take it apart, but it 
&gt; takes a damn fine surgeon to put it all back together without damage. 
&gt; In fact, strictly speaking it is pretty difficult to do this even to 
&gt; a car, if the 'parts' include things like the brake fluid and the 
&gt; gaskets.

MW: Yes well, that suggests corpuscular as a single piece, like a cup or a
gasket or some other. But I get very little leverage off the word
"corpuscular" I can't even find it in the Complete OED.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;MW: Well I have used pretty much just this example to 
&gt; explain the difference
&gt; &gt;between a collection (sense of fusion) and an assembly 
&gt; relation between a
&gt; &gt;whole and its parts. I'm not sure if this is Ian's sense 
&gt; here. He seems to
&gt; &gt;be talking about the wholes, rather than the relations but 
&gt; the distinction
&gt; &gt;is much the same. The key is that with a collection (fusion) 
&gt; the whole is
&gt; &gt;precisely the sum of the parts, with an assembly the whole 
&gt; is something more
&gt; &gt;than the sum of the parts. It is quite interesting just how 
&gt; many sorts of
&gt; &gt;whole/part there are (and which ones really are distinct and useful).
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting observation, which ought to be relevant to Guarinian 
&gt; ideas about individuation criteria. 

MW: We found some for ourselves, but I steal from the best with pride.
Nicola and some of his colleagues were a key source.

&gt; Got any proto-classification of 
&gt; kinds of part/whole relationships? 

MW: Yes, they are mostly related to inanimate objects. You can find them in
the EPISTLE Core Model as subtypes of composition_of_individual.

&gt; (The sociologist Irving Goffman 
&gt; had some lovely ones, eg a 'with', which is a group of people all 
&gt; keeping conversational contact with one another inside a large crowd, 
&gt; like a group of friends at a football match. They neednt be in 
&gt; physical contact and might drift apart for a while, but soon get back 
&gt; within speaking distance.)

MW: I'm afraid I mostly give up with human related stuff, you can have
anything you like, almost by definition.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;. If some piece of a machine starts to move, one can split
&gt; &gt; &gt; the space-time of the machine so as to focus on, say, the leading
&gt; &gt; &gt; edge of the moving part during the movement (is this an 
&gt; occurrent or
&gt; &gt; &gt; a continuant? Why should I give a damn?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Quite - not that I would use such language :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but then you probably aren't Irish.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; indefinitely divisible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the limits of perception by the available sense organs 
&gt; or measuring
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;instruments.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; How do we classify things which are partly continuous and 
&gt; partly not?
&gt; &gt; &gt; (You know, like almost any complicated piece of 
&gt; machinery, say; or a
&gt; &gt; &gt; company, for example.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, it is poor strategy to introduce epistemic notions like
&gt; &gt; &gt; perception into the explanation.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: This is also a matter of scale. If I have a glass of 
&gt; water, I can easily
&gt; &gt;divide it up until I get to a single water molecule, but 
&gt; then division is
&gt; &gt;impossible withou deconstructing the water molecule (and 
&gt; there are certainly
&gt; &gt;instruments that can perceive a water molecule). The same 
&gt; thing happens with
&gt; &gt;sand. However, a football crowd could just as easily be 
&gt; treated as something
&gt; &gt;continuous, or traffic, or a galaxy. Something being 
&gt; continuous really says
&gt; &gt;that you are only interested in properties at an aggregate 
&gt; level relative to
&gt; &gt;the scale of the objects that make up the thing that is continuous.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Treating something as continuous is something we do - usually for
&gt; &gt;mathematical convenience, but it is not what anything is. 
&gt; (You might have
&gt; &gt;some discussion  about this at the sub-atomic scale, but 
&gt; that is largely a
&gt; &gt;reflection of this being where the boudaries of knowledge 
&gt; lie at present.)
&gt; 
&gt; I see what you mean, but I was meaning a different point. Lets agree 
&gt; that at some scale  a piece of rock, say, is continuous in the sense 
&gt; that a machine with many inner moving parts is not continuous. BUt 
&gt; now think of almost any reasonably complicated piece of machinery - a 
&gt; conveyor belt carrying coke to a furnace, say - and ask is *it* 
&gt; continuous or not? And the answer has to be, parts of it are and 
&gt; parts of it aren't.
&gt; ...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; is typical of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;computer programs or idealized approximations to physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; processes, changes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occur in discrete steps called events, which are interleaved
&gt; &gt; &gt; with periods of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;inactivity called states.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a neat idea, but very hard to get right. The problem is to
&gt; &gt; &gt; say just what a period of inactivity is. That seems 
&gt; obvious until you
&gt; &gt; &gt; try to axiomatize it. For example, consider someone who 
&gt; falls asleep
&gt; &gt; &gt; while leaning on a door, thereby preventing the door from 
&gt; opening. In
&gt; &gt; &gt; a sense he isnt doing anything, just being there in an inactive
&gt; &gt; &gt; state; but if someone is trying to open the door, he IS doing
&gt; &gt; &gt; something: he is preventing them opening the door. (Under 
&gt; the right
&gt; &gt; &gt; surrounding circumstances he could be accused of 
&gt; negligent homicide.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; In computers we do have a fairly clear criterion for this 
&gt; notion of
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'inactivity', but computers are carefully crafted to make that
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible. On the other hand, there are plenty of examples 
&gt; of physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; processes which are best described as discrete, eg the motion of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; shuttle in a loom, or the action of a valve tappet; but 
&gt; these are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; interleaved with complete inactivity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: We have found this somewhat problematic.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not surprised. Even lawyers have trouble with this one.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;We have a rather broad view of
&gt; &gt;what a state is, which interestingly includes activities. So 
&gt; a state for us
&gt; &gt;is any piece of space time where the time dimension is 
&gt; non-zero (though it
&gt; &gt;may be vanishingly small). The useful ones are those for which some
&gt; &gt;predicate is true, e.g. being a person, being at 20C, being 
&gt; a husband, being
&gt; &gt;a football match etc. Some states are a temporal part of 
&gt; others. So being a
&gt; &gt;husband is a temporal part of being a person. Being a 
&gt; quarterback in a
&gt; &gt;particular footbal match is a temporal part of the football 
&gt; match AND a
&gt; &gt;temporal part of a person.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: It really is possible to represent accurately quite 
&gt; complex ideas with
&gt; &gt;some very simple basic concepts - but this is what 4D is all about.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Oh the changes (timeless events) are the temporal 
&gt; boundaries of states.
&gt; 
&gt; Purely temporal, or could they slope? eg think of a moving sprayer, 
&gt; and the spatiotemporal locus of where the water stops being under 
&gt; high pressure.

MW: We have the concept of a stream which slopes. I think this would cover
this case, but I'm not sure what sense of moving you mean here, a rotary
sprayer, or a moving truck. I guess in either case a stream is part of it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;They are when a state starts or stops. Generally we think of 
&gt; activities as
&gt; &gt;causing events, at some level.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the root
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;node of the ontology.")
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: How can this be? If it is only the class of individuals, what are
&gt; &gt;classes a member of? If classes are a member of something 
&gt; else, then this is
&gt; &gt;not the root of the ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: If the ontology has a root (and I would certainly 
&gt; suggest it should
&gt; &gt;have) then it needs to be the class of all things 
&gt; (individuals, relations,
&gt; &gt;classes, and anything else you have).
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, good point.
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A technical question: do spaces and times themselves have 
&gt; a location
&gt; &gt; &gt; in spacetime? (My own preference is to say not, but Cyc takes a
&gt; &gt; &gt; different view. But either way, we need a clear answer to avoid
&gt; &gt; &gt; rapidly descending into muddled axioms.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Interstingly we see spaces and times as having a 
&gt; location in space time.
&gt; &gt;So a point in time is a plane through all space at a point 
&gt; in time (to keep
&gt; &gt;square with relativity, you have to add from some viewpoint 
&gt; - for which the
&gt; &gt;Earth is convenient). Similarly, a space is a 4D solid of 
&gt; some space for all
&gt; &gt;time (again relative to what is important). Things like 3pm, 
&gt; or January, or
&gt; &gt;sphere, are classes of time or shape.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, that is pretty much the Cyc view as well, insofar as it has a 
&gt; coherent view on this. So you basically don't distinguish between a 
&gt; point on the time-axis and the 3-d 'plane' of 4-space at that point? 
&gt; (Sod relativity, by the way.)

MW: Remember where I come from people are projecting 3D onto 2D (or even
higher dimensionality) all the time, so we have no trouble with one being
the projection of the other onto a lower dimensional space.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In
&gt; &gt; &gt; logic, the assertion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds
&gt; &gt; &gt; to some aspect
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an
&gt; &gt; &gt; example, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat
&gt; &gt; &gt; characterizes the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;entity named Yojo.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This doesnt seem to distinguish the sentence from the proposition
&gt; &gt; &gt; expressed by that sentence. Exactly what a proposition is, is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; matter of controversy, but in at least one view, it isnt 
&gt; anything at
&gt; &gt; &gt; all like a sentence. BTW, what exactly is the word "Cat" 
&gt; supposed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; indicate in that last sentence?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Why is this a subclass of assembly? Propositions would 
&gt; appear to be
&gt; &gt;abstract. I expect things that are assembled to be things I 
&gt; can touch.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the intuition is that parsing is analogous to disassembly. 
&gt; Not *physical* disassembly, but a kind of conceptual taking-apart by 
&gt; assigning names to 'pieces' like noun phrases, etc. . But it seems a 
&gt; very limp analogy to use in an ontology.

MW: I'd rather understand what is is, using analogy seems a cop out.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some
&gt; &gt; &gt; other entity.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ? The relation is an entity in a relationship to some 
&gt; other entity?
&gt; &gt; &gt; So if (R a b), R is not the relation, but a and b are? 
&gt; This is just
&gt; &gt; &gt; nonsense.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Quite. I would be inclined to say "A class of tuples", 
&gt; but in KIF the
&gt; &gt;relation stands as a predicate, and I have never quite got 
&gt; to the bottom of
&gt; &gt;whether predicate and class are synonyms (for which I find as yet no
&gt; &gt;contrary evidence).
&gt; 
&gt; Strictly speaking a predicate (extension) on X is a set (= class) of 
&gt; 1-tuples of members of X, rather than a set of members of X. To 
&gt; identify these is a common abuse of notation.

MW: I have seen different definitions of one tuples, one that said that a 1
tuple was the object it contained, the other that it was the singleton set
of the object it contained.

Do you have a view on that?
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Yes (with my engineers hat on) What would a pipe be 
&gt; without the hole in
&gt; &gt;the middle?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, (with my carpenter's hat on), it sounds like a rod, or 
&gt; maybe a bar?

MW: Not much good for putting oil through though.
