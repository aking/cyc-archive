Jon Awbrey quoth (much like a Raven?):
&gt; Let me offer what I think would be a more helpful heading
&gt; for this subject, one which includes the specification of
&gt; the domains of definition of a relation as a special case.
&gt; Under this "form of generalization" (FOG), one may regard
&gt; an arbitrary relation -- and if I deem to say "arbitrary",
&gt; you can bet that I mean it with that proverbial vengeance,
&gt; conceptively encircling in one swell foop many multitudes
&gt; of hosts of relations for which the quarter of a constant
&gt; or even a definite adicity (arete, valence) cannot exactly
&gt; be exacted or expected, but never mind all of that now --
&gt; like I was saying, one may regard one's so-called "source"
&gt; relation as being "related" -- for let us not prejudge the
&gt; end of the day's fray by speaking of its being "reduced" --
&gt; to another collection of one's so-called "target" relations.

Okay so to use the paper-clip and worms pictoral form,
your "domains of definition of a relation" are groups
of worms. Doing the worm to marble mental 'transform',
each marble is separated into different hoops, with each hoop
specifying a different 'argument position' of the relation.
Of course, since the hoops are venn diagram hoops, any particular
marble may actually be in more than one hoop at the same 'time'.

Your "source" relation is (when viewed extensionally) a hoop full of
paperclips that all have the same colour (intention) as the hoop.
The associating of the relation with the domains (hoops) 
of its 'arguments', is again a paperclip connecting that
relation's hoop-as-worm with the domain's hoop-as-worm.
It will be generally a shade of the NTH-RELATION or NTH-SUBCLASS
colour, and in general be a different colour from your source
relations's colour.

So you are introducing a "target" relation which is similar
in shape to the source relation except that the colour of the hoops
and paper-clips is different from the source relations's colour as
well.  (Technically,if the source and the target express the same
intention, they are the same colour, and hence the same intentional
relation, so the reduction relation is simply the identity relation.)

Your FOG (form of generalization) is just saying that your reduction
relation is extensionally just a hoop of paperclips itself.
Each paperclip then is binding a particular source-relation-as-worm
and a particular target-relation-as-worm.

&gt; In many situations, we may speak of this relation between
&gt; source and target relations as a relation of "projection",
&gt; but one will most likely be able to think of other brands
&gt; of relations between relations that are not apt to fall,
&gt; nor very aptly to be cast, under this "projective" pall.
&gt; But never mind all that now -- it is best to start with
&gt; the easy examples and the familiar facets of phenomena.

Right any particular reduction relation's colour may be a
shade of the "projection" hue. (I hope this analogy doesn't
cause you to cry)

&gt; 
&gt; In this view, to speak of the "place-j domain" of a relation
&gt; is to speak of what remains to speak of in the relation when
&gt; we choose not to speak of what resides in the other places of
&gt; the relation.  

Right. this "place-j domain" is what I'm envisioning as a 
particular argument hoop of a relation.

&gt; That is to say, if one pictures a k-place relation
&gt; as a k-column relational data table -- "But is it a table already
&gt; filled or a table yet to be filled?" you cleverly ask, and I will
&gt; have to let my silence pass for the promise to think on an answer
&gt; anon -- then one may think of this table as being set, that is to
&gt; say, quite literally defined, by the specification of those very
&gt; k projections onto those very k target domains of which we desire
&gt; to speak.

No.
you are saying that the table (hoop of marbles in my picture)
is defined by the hoops of argument domains that are paperclipped to it.
You are forgetting that the hoop of marbles also has an intensional
definition (colour) of its own. As to how filled the hoop/table is,
it depends on if the hoop/table has an extension. And that fact is
totally off topic (I think) from your current focus of conversation. 

&gt;  And that is "sort of" how the "a la cartesian product"
&gt; is actually defined in Category Theory, as best I can remember on
&gt; the current occasion, or as best I can tell at the present moment.
&gt; 
I defer to your judgement, I don't know enough Category Theory.

&gt; In sum, a question about the place-j domain of a k-place relation
&gt; is a question about the place-j projection of that k-place relation
&gt; onto a monadic relation, in short, it's about a projection onto a set.
&gt; 
You must have made an intuitive leap into specialized vocabulary.
I'm not sure what that means in my visualization.

&gt; One step up from this question, one can ask about about the projections
&gt; of a source relation onto targets that are all of them dyadic relations.
&gt; 
&gt; And so it goes ...
&gt; 
&gt; By way of trying to establish parallels between different forms of language,
&gt; I will try to go through the rest of this exchange between Chris and Dieter,
&gt; and to say how I would try to describe, from the POV that is outlined above,
&gt; what it appears from this perspective is being talked about here.
&gt; 
I await your work with interest.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Deiter,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am interested in some of your comments re: relation.
&gt; &gt; They bring up a point that has been bothering me for
&gt; &gt; some time.  And maybe one on which the SUO needs to
&gt; &gt; make an informed choice?  Anyway I'd be interested
&gt; &gt; in your position.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that there are (at least) two views
&gt; &gt; regarding particular relations in use in computing
&gt; &gt; (Fritz Lehmann of Cyc has made a similar point).
&gt; 
&gt; "(at least) two views"
&gt; 
&gt; I am mostly concerned with relating
&gt; "relations given by extension" to
&gt; "relations given by intension" so
&gt; I am hoping at this point that the
&gt; two views that you mention will be
&gt; ones that I can successfully relate
&gt; to questions of their ex-/in-tensions.

This (in my visualization)  is the relation-as-hoop versus
relation-as-colour.  It isn't clear to me what questions
you want to ask/relate.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One based in set theory may be called the 'bare relation' theory.
&gt; &gt; In this view there are tuples (bare relations) with effectively
&gt; &gt; no real content.

The tuples correspond to the paperclips. I'm not sure what Chris
meant about the tuples having no real content.

&gt; 
&gt; I would say that a relation is always something more than 
&gt; any of its tuples, and even if the extension of the relation 
&gt; happens to be a singleton set, since,
&gt; even then, most will say that {&lt;x1, ..., xk&gt;} is something more 
&gt; than &lt;x1, ..., xk&gt;.

Right. the hoop containing a paperclip is more than just the 
paperclip alone.

&gt; Peirce used the term "elementary relation" as the intensional 
&gt; correspondent of the extensional tuple, but this is a fine 
&gt; point that one commonly glosses over.

I think (or rather hope) that the elementary relation is the
colour of some particular paper-clip. In my visualization,
I've equated this with the colour of the hoop. Was Peirce
arguing that  each paper-clip in a hoop is actually a shade
of the colour of the hoop? (the intension of a particular
extension of a relation is actually distinct from the
intension of the relation-as-a-set-of-tuples?

&gt; When you said "real content", I was just guessing that
&gt; you meant something about a thing having intensional
&gt; attributes, features, or properties.  Is that close?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One based more on database theory (within computing) assumes that
&gt; &gt; particular relations have content -- that there is, for example,
&gt; &gt; a particular 'between relation' between a number of particular
&gt; &gt; things (I believe (some?) DLs also take this view -- could you
&gt; &gt; confirm this?  Maybe OIL also takes this view?).
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am guessing that my previous guess was wrong.
&gt; Here, you seem to be using "content" to describe
&gt; the extension of a relation.  Is that closer?
&gt; 
I think this between relation he his talking about is a 
relation-as-paperclip binding different relations-as-worms.
The paperclip is of the "between" colour.

&gt; &gt; This seems to be what you are talking about when you wrote:
&gt; &gt; "Any particular relation is not itself a set of relations.
&gt; &gt; 'between' does not specify a set of between-ness relations,
&gt; &gt; it's just a particular relation."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Under a bare relation view there is,
&gt; &gt; of course, no such thing as a particular
&gt; &gt; (in its strong sense) between relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am just totally lost ...

The set of between-ness relations is a hoop of all "between" coloured
paperclips.  My model dis-agrees with him because I can easy envision
its existence, so I don't know he thinks it doesn't exist. Much less to
say its lack of existence is so obvious as 'of course'.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The advantage of the 'bare relation' view is that
&gt; &gt; it uses a single mechanism for 'inheritance' over
&gt; &gt; 'concepts' and 'relations' (as you have classified them).
&gt; &gt; The disadvantage of the 'content' view is that is substitutes
&gt; &gt; inference for inheritance -- x-father-y-son implies x-parent-y-child --
&gt; &gt; rather than (x, y) is a member of (father-son) and (parent-child)
&gt; &gt; and (father-son) is a sub-class of (parent-child).
&gt; &gt; 

I can see the tie between inference and inheritance. I can also see
that they are different. I'm wondering if Chris is getting too close
to an engineering distinction here. Though this detail may need to be
made in the creation of the SUO.

&gt; &gt; This is of course only the begining of the story --
&gt; &gt; there is much more to consider when making the judgement.
&gt; &gt; However the choice has implications for the axioms you use
&gt; &gt; to manage relation 'inheritance'.
&gt; 
&gt; Any clarification that anybody can supply would be appreciated ...
&gt; 
&gt; Many Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey

I hope my visualisation helps you.
