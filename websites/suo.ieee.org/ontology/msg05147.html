ELF.  Literature Note 13

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

GR = Gary Richmond
JA = Jon Awbrey

JA: How I got into this was that Murray said he was interested in LBase,
    I remembered that there was something I liked at the beginning of it,
    and that other than that it seemed like a fairly standard presentation
    of &quot;classical model theory&quot;, the model theory of first order logic, and
    I said that I would read through it with him, as long as he participated
    actively enough to keep me from falling asleep and to let me be guided by
    what in particular he wanted to do with it.  I started with the words and
    sentences that were there in the text, and I will return to that as soon
    as we get some common ground, and I merely introduced a bit of my own
    interpretive apparatus, in part by way of preparing for the sort of
    comparative study that I believe Murray has in mind.  So naturally
    there will be some compromise formations of sundry nomenclatures.

GR: Being a &quot;full-time warrior&quot;, I'm sure Murray 
    will continue this inquiry with you. I have 
    found it quite valuable so far, and cogently
    discussed considering the difficulty of the 
    subject matter.

GR: There is also a strong suggestion of an important ongoing
    inquiry in your consideration of especially the question
    of &quot;interpretation&quot; theory, with implications not only
    for semiotic (which I'm most interested in, of course),
    but also hermeneutic more generally.  (I will get to 
    the Gallagher and Palmer links should I have some
    time in the next week, which now seems unlikely,
    I'm afraid  :-(  ) 

GR: (Btw, I hope I'm not only a weekend warrior, but I am
    thinking that I am also not EVEN a weekend warrior as
    I have so many obligations and even types of obligations
    these days that I can't always respond &quot;in a timely fashion&quot;
    as I go about &quot;earning an earning&quot;.  In short, whereas Murray
    is a stimulant, I may prove to be a soporific (all by way of
    explaining why it's taken me time to get back to you, Murray,
    and others).

GR: These &quot;compromise formations&quot; seem to
    suggest a further study, wouldn't you
    say (maybe a part of rhetoric as method?)

It's a term of art from psychoanalysis, I think --
memories like strawberries, though, too long in
the fridge.  But I descry a nurtural connection
to rhetoric, via, what else? -- interpretation.

GR: As noted, I've been following your analysis as best I can, and
    find considerable merit in it, for example, in your analysis of
    the Guha-Hayes model-theoretic semantic material, your tenth
    reading which rendered (as something of a conclusion).

                 Translation
Source Language o----------&gt;o Target Language
                 \         /
                  \       /
                   \     /
                    \   /
                     v v
                      o
                    World

GR: This is certainly preferable to the first common-sensical diagram
    and makes complete sense to me now.  So, I am, of course, eagerly
    awaiting your 11th reading!  We who are neither logicians nor
    mathematicians are always especially pleased to read clear
    explications of ideas in words and diagrams as intuitive
    as your recent ones have been.

Thanks, Gary, that duel sense -- nice typo, I think I'll stet it --
of &quot;interpretation&quot; is utterly standard in model theory, and so
I'll hang onto it, too.  It's just a matter of proper tining.

GR: I keep hoping the collaborative intelligence
    is evolutionary in the Engelbartian sense.  

JA: Hope springs eternal ...

GR: But also, as Peirce notes, despair, lack of hope, is illogical
    I think he implies somewhere (maybe in a letter to Viola Welby)
    that all its (despair's) inferences -- if it can even be said to
    have any (for what's the &quot;leading principle&quot; but something like,
    &quot;'it' all doesn't mean anything, anyhow&quot;, are invalid, go nowhere,
    do nothing, certainly do not evidence signs of evolution, or even
    of growth.

Did you ever look up the etymology of &quot;nirvana&quot;?

Jon Awbrey

GR: Peirce further comments that not only hope, but also,
    and perhaps especially, sacrifice in relation to the
    community is essential in logic.

    | He who would not sacrifice his own soul to save the whole
    | world, is illogical in all his inferences, collectively.
    | So the social principle is rooted intrinsically in logic.*
    |
    | C.S. Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 5.354.

GR: I've appended to this message a group of longer passages from which 
    the quotation directly above is excerpted; also, a summary, by way
    of even briefer excepts from the appended passages -- one from each
    of the paragraphs quoted -- directly below:

| Peirce: CP 5.354  He who would not sacrifice his own soul to save the
| whole world, is illogical in all his inferences, collectively. So the
| social principle is rooted intrinsically in logic.*

| To be logical men should not be selfish; and, in point of fact, they
| are not so selfish as they are thought.  The willful prosecution of
| one's desires is a different thing from selfishness. 

| Now, it is not necessary for logicality that a man should himself be
| capable of the heroism of self-sacrifice.  It is sufficient that he
| should recognize the possibility of it, should perceive that only
| that man's inferences who has it are really logical, and should
| consequently regard his own as being only so far valid as they
| would be accepted by the hero.  So far as he thus refers his
| inferences to that standard, he becomes identified with such
| a mind.

| This makes logicality attainable enough.
| Sometimes we can personally attain to heroism. 

| But all this requires a conceived identification of
| one's interests with those of an unlimited community. 

| It may seem strange that I should put forward three sentiments, namely,
| interest in an indefinite community, recognition of the possibility of
| this interest being made supreme, and hope in the unlimited continuance
| of intellectual activity, as indispensable requirements of logic.  Yet,
| when we consider that logic depends on a mere struggle to escape doubt,
| which, as it terminates in action, must begin in emotion, and that,
| furthermore, the only cause of our planting ourselves on reason is
| that other methods of escaping doubt fail on account of the social
| impulse, why should we wonder to find social sentiment presupposed
| in reasoning?
|
| C.S. Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 2.655.
