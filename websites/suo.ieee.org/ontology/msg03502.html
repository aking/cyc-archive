Matthew,

Trimming a bit and continuing ...

JA = Jon Awbrey
JS = Jim Schoening
MW = Matthew West

MW: However, you have frequently suggested that the only sort of document
    that you find acceptable is something that purports to be a standard
    ontology, which doesn't leave those of us that think there are some
    pre-requisites anywhere much to go.

MW: He has shown lots of early words.
    The whole Functional Logic thread
    is early words.

JA: Look, I have a set piece of work that bears on the aims of this group.
    Many foundational portions of it were developed between 1967 and 1992.
    The actual writing of this work into the form of a dissertation in the
    field of Systems Engineering was done from 1992 to 2000, with ongoing
    cosmetic changes up until the present time.  Over the last year in the
    SUO WG I have changed my writing style, which I routinely do whenever
    I write a lot, whether programming, prose, or poetry, and I have even
    changed my research direction and focus a bit &quot;under the infuence&quot; of
    SUO WG norms and goals.  Independently of these developments, one of
    my advisors with considerable expertise in software reusability from
    within a relational programming paradigm has developed an interest
    in description logics and ontological applications.  So I could be
    in this for the long haul.

JA: Of course, there is a big difference between the style of a formal dissertation
    and the cross of a practical application.  So it is necessary to keep plugging
    away at applicable ways of saying what it all means in practice.  Easier said
    than done, as I'm sure you know.

JA: It relates to both of the starter documents to the differential
    extents that both of them are still trying to represent their
    ontologies in KIF, and KIF in its current form will fail as
    a representation language, both on the grounds of its
    inherent pragmatic inadequacies, and on the grounds
    that no one from the mathematical community, at
    the very least, would ever try to do use it
    for any significant task.

JA: Again, I have no special collection of axes to grind or bones to pick with KIF --
    never even heard of it until a year or so ago -- but I have been examining the
    syntactic, semantic, semiotic, and general pragmatic properties of languages,
    natural and technical, gross and subtle, for as long as I can remember, and
    I crafted my first experimental langauge for a specific technical purpose
    somewheres about in the 4th grade.  As far as logical calculi go, I pretty
    much quit using, for the sake of my own thinking, the notational system that
    builds so shakily on the familiar alphabet {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ...}
    as soon as I happened on the far more exacting and the far more powerful, for
    all conceptual and practical purposes, logical sytems of Charles Sanders Peirce
    and George Spencer Brown, sometime in the period 1967-1969, some very fuzzy years.
    I gradually grew and scruffily scribbled these two genre of logical graphs on paper
    constantly, working in parallel under both the &quot;entitative&quot; and the &quot;existential&quot;
    interpretations, and eventually evolved a few extensions of my own, discovering
    the item that I sometimes still call the &quot;boundary operator&quot;, on analogy with
    a construct that figures mightily in algebraic topology, on the period around
    1976-1980, some more hazy days.  This operator is the germinal root of both
    the &quot;reflective&quot; and the &quot;differential&quot; extensions logical graphs, that
    now constitute Ref Log and Dif Log, respectively.

JA: So, to make a long story bear on the current point of application,
    I would criticize in the just same way any concrete syntax that
    proposes to use the factitious family of specious primitives
    that are commonly symbolized by the means of the unsouper
    alphabet {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ...} and its ilk.
    There are compelling formal and overwhelming practical
    reasons for regarding any such system with the same
    sort of disregard that anybody would have for the
    unhappy motley of roman numerals, if shanghaied
    as a crew in a futile venture to pirate the
    differential and integral calculus.

JA: I have mentioned all of these facts with all due consistency from
    the very beginning of my service here, long before I ever dreamed
    that something called &quot;KIF&quot; would become an issue -- it was when
    David Whitten first asked for feedback on a Starter Ontology,
    if I recall -- and the only thing that surprised me then
    and still shocks me today is that it was news to anybody
    in a group that numbered such lights as I regarded JSF
    to be.  And the fact that I must report this anywhere
    else but on the Main is to me a sign that some folks
    have indeed understood perfectly clearly what I have
    been saying all along, a leading indicator of just
    how much force of arms lies behind certain fixed
    arrays of economic and hidebound interests, and
    a symptom of just how sick the dynamics of
    a group can become, whenever it abdicates
    its duty to inquiry under the influence
    of that whole ilk of unreasoning force.

In answering your questions below, I will shift back to the larger arena, and address
the properties of all FONAI (families of notation and implementation) that take as the
generators of their ensuing generations the logical ligaments that are commonly denoted
by means of ligatures like {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ...}.  Making up a nonce nomen
just off the cusp of my head, let us call this soup the &quot;PentAlphaBet&quot; (PAB), and from
this point on I will focus my critique, no more on poor innocent and utterly dependent
epigone KIF, but on the much larger steaming kettle of PAB from whence this pot of
message that we call &quot;KIF&quot; was initially dipped and incrementally spoon-fed to us.

Furthermore, taking the &quot;whole systems&quot; approach, as the better half
of my training has always taught me to do, I will not try to disjoin
the questions of human conceptual and machine computational features
in my analysis, but contemplate the whole impact of PAB or any FONAI
on the whole chiasmatic system of &quot;computer-human interaction&quot; (CHI).

But I am having to work in starts and fits today ...

Jon Awbrey

MW: I recall this now you mention it, but missed it in my summary
    of what I think you are about below.  I'd like to understand
    better why you think [PAB] is inadequate.  For example is it:

MW: 1. The notation is obscure and difficult for humans to
       read and understand (but convenient for computers).

MW: 2. [PAB] is an ASCIIfication of First Order Logic, and FOL is inadequate
       to the task at hand (if so please explain why and what is needed).

MW: 3. [PAB] does not give adequate support for semiotics (or some other key theory).

MW: For myself, I don't like KIF, but I think I can live with it.

JA: People learn to live with many things.

But those who do not study the story of Nazi and Soviet and Taliban history
are doomed to repeat it.  It all begins with infinitesimal, incre-mental,
inconspicuous, and innocuous, all too e-noxious abuses of power.

JA: The question is whether we can think
    of a better tool for the task at hand.
    I already have.  This is not arrogance.
    The ground was broken, and the groundwork
    laid by Peirce long ago -- Existential Graphs
    and Conceptual Graphs are in the same ballpark --
    I have added a few improvements of my own that
    I happen to like and the utilities of which it
    is my job to demonstrate.  I could do this if
    I am ever given half a chance.

JA: We would be far better off just
    writing the standard out in plain
    math/logic monograph style. 

MW: I don't see how this helps interoperability between computer systems.

JA: It is like the development, the initial definition, and the
    eventual formal specification of any programming language,
    say, Lisp or Pascal, just the last ones that I used a lot.
    Wirth's and McCarthy's standards began as plain papers in
    the usual computing science, logi, and mathematical styles.
    McCarthy continued to use his language of M-expressions as
    the definitive source and the medium of communication with
    himself, even when nobody else understood why it was needed,
    over and above the language of compu'terpri'able S-expressions
    that all the world knows as Lisp.  To me this is quite plain.
    He was, and still is, addressing the Ages.

JA: I am definitely not saying that we should not seek a computationally
    implemented language.  Indeed, I would insist that we must at least
    develop the prototype &quot;test of concept&quot;, and usually many of them,
    in order to know if what we specify has a practical realization.
    Indeed, that may be the only useful thing that we can do here --
    and it would put the reductive examples of ontologies that we
    have been cudgeling our brains about in their proper light,
    namely, as little more than &quot;test data structures&quot; for
    the evaluation of the implicit, as yet vaporware,
    ontology maintainance software.  I know the
    &quot;receiver operating characteristocs&quot; of
    many of our prospective user groups,
    and I know that this is exactly how
    they would view our feeble SUO's, as
    just so many &quot;dumb textbook examples&quot;,
    of some use in paidagogy, nothing more.

JA: I am trying to help you with that problem, by delivering a new language
    to you that solves the fundamental problems in a fundamental way.  

MW: So is that the real purpose of your ASCIIfied notation?

No, the asciification is in direct response to a request from Chris Menzel.

JA: The basement is dug ...

MW: It being ...?

JA: My whole work in logic, graph theory, formal language theory,
    computer science, sign relational semiotics, systems theory,
    in sum, inquiry driven systems.

MW: You know it would be really handy to see the plans ...

JA: This is a what my dissertation is,
    a portion of which I am presently
    elaborating and expositing on the
    Ontology List.

JA: and the building of the next story is admittedly incomplete,
    but the fundamental medium is planned out right for what is
    probably the first time in history.

MW: But (assuming this is so) at present only in your head.

JA: No, I implemented the basic &quot;test of concept&quot; all through the 80's,
    a Pascal program that is entitled &quot;Theme One&quot;, and that I still use
    today as my main &quot;Propositional Calculator&quot; for any complex problem,
    and submitted it in partial fulfilment of the requirements for my
    Master's in Quantitative Psych at Michigan State University (1989).
    I then adopted this as the ground floor of my current PhD programme
    in Systems Engineering at Oakland University in Michigan, and I have
    been building on that basis with due diligence up until this moment.

JA: And now a few haunting refrains from the overture:

JA: <A  HREF="http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm">http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm</A>

JA: (The advertizing group has requested a #bold statement# for its copy.)

MW: Not the kind of summary of where you are going I had in mind.

JA: &quot;Where no one has gone before ...&quot;

JA: Bold statements make me weary -- I have will have to break here.

JA: Still having trouble getting past this point.

JS: If so, did he formally propose it to them and explain how it fits?
    If not, please explain its contribution.

MW: Jon's paper presents some foundations of logic which he thinks
    are important to set out as the basis for what is to follow.
    This is important, because as you will already have seen,
    logic, and some of the stuff immediately around it, is
    not as cut and dried as we might like to think.  There
    are choices to be made, and these should be made
    explicitly. As you may conclude from his exchange
    with CM, there is nothing earth shattering here.

MW: Jon's main contention that this is all leading to is that
    the &quot;big problem&quot; we really face is ontology development,
    rather than a specific ontology, and that we need amongst
    other things to specify and develop tools for this purpose.
    This would support an &quot;enquiry&quot; process which would support
    the interaction between ontology developers to help them
    resolve issues and move forwards.  He correctly identifies
    semiotics (for practical purpose the relationships between
    terms and meanings) as a key element in this.

MW: The main reason I am bothering to mediate here is that I have
    enough experience from my base standards community to know that
    he is right about these things. If we think we are going to create
    anything significant by hand coding KIF files, we don't understand
    the problem, but that is where we are right now.

JS: He is welcome to do his exploring on the Ontology list,
    but it doesn't belong on the SUO list.  If we met in person, 
    he wouldn't be permitted to do about a quarter of the talking
    on these types of topics.

I thought that's why we got into the Al Gore Rhythm of the Internet in the first place.
