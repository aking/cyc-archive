Inquiring Minds,

Correcting a few really persistent typos and continuing on.
I am trying to get to the Sections that explain what I mean
by a "field of inquiry" (FOI) and by a "knowledge field" (KF).
As always, all of the pun-particles are wholly intentional and
all of the mug-wavicles are wholly intensional -- what's the diff? --
that is the subtext of yet another papyrus, if not already palimpsest.

Psahmes the Notescraper

1.1.1  Systematic Inquiry

In their underlying form and tone these questions sound a familiar tune.
Their basic tenor was brought to a pitch of perfection by Immanuel Kant,
in a canon of inquiry that exceeds my present range.  Luckily, my immediate
aim is much more limited and concrete.  For the present it is only required
to ask:  "How are systematic inquiry and knowledge possible?"  That is, how
are inquiry and knowledge to be understood and implemented as functions of
systems and how ought they be investigated by systems theory?  In short:
"How can systems have knowledge as a goal?"  This effort is constrained to
the subject of systems and the frame of systems theory.  It will attempt
to give system-theoretic analyses of concepts and capacities that can be
recognized as primitive archetypes, at least, of those that AI research
pursues with avid interest and aspires one day to more fully capture.
By limiting questions about the possibility of inquiry and knowledge
to the subject and scope of systems theory there may be reason to
hope for a measure of practical success.

Kant's challenge is this:  To say precisely 'how' it is possible,
in procedural terms, for contingent beings and empirical creatures,
physically embodied and even engineered systems, to move toward or
synthetically acquire forms of knowledge with an 'a priori' character,
that is, declarative statements with a global application to all of the
situations that these agents might pass through.  It is not feasible within
the scope of systems theory and engineered systems to deal with the larger
question:  Whether these forms of knowledge are somehow 'necessary' laws,
applying to all conceivable systems and universes.  But it does seem
reasonable to ask how a system's trajectory might intersect with states
whose associated knowledge components have a wider application to the
system's manifold as a whole.

1.1.2  Intelligence, Knowledge, Execution

Intelligence, for my purposes, is characterized as a technical ability of choice
in a situation 'as represented'.  It is the ability to pick out a line on a map,
to find a series of middle terms making connections between represented positions.
In the situation that commonly calls it out, intelligence is faced with two
representations of position.  This pair of pointers to points on a map are
typically interpreted as indices of current and desired positions.  The two 
images are symbols or analogues of the actual site and the intended goal of
a system.  They themselves exist in a space that shadows the dynamic reality
of the agent involved.  But the dynamic reality of the intelligent agent forms
a manifold of states that subsists beneath its experience and becomes manifest 
only gradually and partially in the observations of that agent.  It is among
the states of this basic manifold that all the real sites and goals of the
agent are located.

The concept of intelligence laid out here has been abstracted from
two capacities it both requires and supports:  knowledge and execution.
Knowledge is the fund of available representations, the glove-box full of maps.
Execution is the array of possible actions and the power of performing them,
the executive ability that directs motor responses in accord with the line
picked out on the map.  To continue the metaphor, execution is associated
with the driving-gloves, which must be sorted out from the jumble of maps
and used to get a grip on the mechanisms of performance and control that
can actualize choices.
