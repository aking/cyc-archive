Dear John,

As far as I can see we are in violent agreement :-)

&gt; Subject: RE: SUO: RE: Topic Maps
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; As I said in another note, I am not arguing for any particular
&gt; notation for logic.  What I am arguing for is just logic.

MW: I'm not arguing against it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Topic Maps only provides a structuring and linking 
&gt; capability - precisely
&gt; &gt;what KIF doesn't have.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many things that KIF doesn't have.  I regard it as
&gt; the "assembly language" of knowledge representation, and there
&gt; is a very big need for many different kinds of higher-level
&gt; notations that can and should be built on top of KIF.  

MW: I quite agree.

&gt; My own
&gt; work on CGs is designed to provide other features that can
&gt; highlight structures that can be expressed in KIF, but not
&gt; as clearly as in a graph notation.
&gt; 
&gt; The "structuring and linking" of Topic Maps is also very
&gt; important.  But as I said, it can be mapped into logic, and
&gt; therefore into KIF, CGs, controlled English, and many other
&gt; notations.  I would just like to see that mapping made more
&gt; explicit (most people might not want to see the mapping, but
&gt; it should be available to anyone who wants to see it).

MW: At the moment this would be a 2 stage process. There is a "conceptual
model" for Topic Maps as part of the XTM work. This is an entity
relationship model for which there would be a straightforward translation
into FOL.
&gt; 
&gt; Another notation, which I like very much for expressing
&gt; procedural knowledge, is Petri nets (a watered-down version
&gt; of which is called "activity nets" in UML).  

MW: Yes - I am a fan of Petri Nets too.

&gt; In my KR book,
&gt; I showed how Petri nets could be translated to logic, in either
&gt; KIF or CG notation.  That translation, which was much less
&gt; readable than the original P-net form, demonstrated very
&gt; clearly why multiple notations are extremely valuable for many
&gt; purposes.

MW: Yes, I've read it. I agree strongly that KIF makes a good "assembler"
into which higher level (formal) languages can be "compiled" and defined.
&gt; 
&gt; And by the way, my major complaint about UML (which I also
&gt; mention in my KR book) is that
&gt; 
&gt;  1. UML is a collection of notations that are definable on top
&gt;     of logic, but the UML developers are afraid that if they
&gt;     emphasize that point they might scare away people who think
&gt;     that they don't like logic.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. They limit themselves to only 6 different notations.  I
&gt;     would prefer to see a more general version of UML, which
&gt;     was firmly grounded in logic and which supported an open
&gt;     ended (possibly infinite number) of different notations,
&gt;     all of which would map to a common underlying logic.

MW: Well they do have OCL (Object Constraint Language (?))
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;1. Topic Maps can help us to organise our KIF theories - 
&gt; manage the network
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;for us. All we get with KIF is something monolithic.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2. If we are going to get the SUO used, we need to make it easily
&gt; &gt;accessible. We could aid this with the use of Topic Maps.
&gt; 
&gt; I have no quarrel with those points.

MW: I was not trying to make any other.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;What is being suggested has nothing to do with how the 
&gt; ontology is defined.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;There is an issue that KIF is unintelligible to all but a 
&gt; few cognoscenti,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;but that is not what is addressed here.
&gt; 
&gt; I completely agree.  That is why I strongly recommended
&gt; the development of some version of controlled English (and
&gt; other NLs) as a higher-level, more readable supplement to KIF.

MW: Me too. I will get to it some day (I have already made a few informal
attempts). I have in mind something that is natural enough that a computer
programmer would find it straightforward, but something that might fall
short of conforming to English grammar.
&gt;
