Dear Pat,

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Dear Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I only asked if there was an established terminology in 
&gt; logical circles for
&gt; &gt;occurences of relations ....
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry if I got carried away.

MW: Oh it was all good stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;MW: Yes you are blinded by a mathematical and logical education.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, that accounts for a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Mere mortals may have quite a different tradition of speach.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In EPISTLE for example we started out having lots of fun 
&gt; with people talking
&gt; &gt;about "products" or "activities" and it being completely 
&gt; ambiguous whether a
&gt; &gt;class or an individual was meant. We talked just as blythely 
&gt; about "the
&gt; &gt;analysis activity" (a class of activity) as we do about "the 
&gt; sports activity
&gt; &gt;on this Thursday afternoon" (an individual).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For ourselves we decided on a rule that we mostly stick to, 
&gt; which is that
&gt; &gt;words like activity, and for that matter relation when used 
&gt; alone apply to
&gt; &gt;the instance/individual level, and that at the class level 
&gt; we add class as a
&gt; &gt;qualifier, so activity class and relation class. It is a 
&gt; little unnatural at
&gt; &gt;times, but it does make things explicit.
&gt; 
&gt; Well OK, I guess, but then what do you call a class of relations? A 
&gt; relation class class??

MW: No we put the classes at the front, so "class of class of relation". I
know it isn't that pretty, but at least you know what your talking about.
The other advantage of this style (unlike picking difficult words like
Endurantist) is that you probably know what it means without having to
resort to a dictionary, based on a relatively small base set of words (like
relation).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Hence all the recent discussion. The main point of course is 
&gt; to be aware of
&gt; &gt;the potential for ambiguity, and since one is in mixed 
&gt; company not to assume
&gt; &gt;the same background or usage of language.
&gt; 
&gt; True, true.  Sigh.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is important to notice that a particular thing can be in many
&gt; &gt; &gt; different sets, and a particular pair can be in many 
&gt; different sets
&gt; &gt; &gt; of pairs. There is a special set which is unique to any 
&gt; given pair,
&gt; &gt; &gt; which is the set which contains ONLY that pair and no 
&gt; other. This is
&gt; &gt; &gt; also a relation, but a very special one.  Another way to 
&gt; think about
&gt; &gt; &gt; instances is that this unique relation (in our example, it is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; relation which holds only between MW and his wife, and relates no
&gt; &gt; &gt; other individuals: it might be called their particular marriage
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship) is a subset of the married relation, ie 
&gt; subrelation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; it: a thing of the same kind,  but very specialised; in 
&gt; fact, it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; as specialised as a binary relation can get.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Yes, a singleton. Useful for queries on databases, but not much
&gt; &gt;else for me so far. The real thing is to remember that the 
&gt; singleton is
&gt; &gt;still
&gt; &gt;a class and not its member.
&gt; 
&gt; I do tend to get sloppy about that distinction, a common 
&gt; mathematician's sin since to be persnickety about it would get 
&gt; impossibly tiresome when being a 'working mathematician' (I was only 
&gt; an apprentice.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This 'extensional' way of thinking about relations has 
&gt; the merit of
&gt; &gt; &gt; corresponding to logical analysis and, if used carefully, 
&gt; to much of
&gt; &gt; &gt; ordinary usage.  What it fails to do, however, is provide a more
&gt; &gt; &gt; delicate distinction which some folk have suggested is 
&gt; necessary in
&gt; &gt; &gt; an ontology which can reflect the distinctions made in natural
&gt; &gt; &gt; language, which is that between the various *ways* that a relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; might hold. For example, suppose that we say that being wise is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; property (of people), which is true of Socrates (for 
&gt; example) but not
&gt; &gt; &gt; true of our current President (for example). That seems 
&gt; harmless, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; someone might object that he wants to not just say that 
&gt; Socrates is
&gt; &gt; &gt; wise, but to say something more particular about the 
&gt; particular way
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he was wise: to say something, as we might phrase it, about
&gt; &gt; &gt; Socrates' wisdom, as opposed to wisdom in general. ("How do I love
&gt; &gt; &gt; thee? Let me count the ways..." If 'love' is a set of 
&gt; pairs, there's
&gt; &gt; &gt; no counting to be done.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: My simple approach to this would be to have subtypes of 
&gt; wisdom that
&gt; &gt;represented the different ways in which you could be wise. 
&gt; You would be wise
&gt; &gt;if you were a member of any of them, but you could also be 
&gt; wise in many ways
&gt; &gt;by being a member of several. Am I missing something?
&gt; 
&gt; Not really, I suspect. That would be my strategy also. However there 
&gt; is an active school of thought that would claim that this would be 
&gt; missing something important, and that rather than this being an 
&gt; extensional kind of subset relation, there is something inherent in 
&gt; every single predication of any relation to the things it relates, 
&gt; involving a 'trope', ie the 'way' it relates them, and that these 
&gt; 'tropes' are inherently intensional in nature and a vital part of 
&gt; what 'relation' means. I merely pass this on to you in the spirit of 
&gt; fair reporting, and make no further claims. I don't really understand 
&gt; it, but many distinguished SUO-ers, including Nicola Guarino, Chris 
&gt; Menzel, Fritz Lehman and others have urged that these ideas be taken 
&gt; seriously. If you give 'trope' to Google <A  HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A>  you 
&gt; will find much more on this topic.

MW: I just looked trope up in "A Companion to Metaphysics", Kim and Sosa.
What I read there sounded very similar to aspect. Been there, it gets very
complicated in an unnecessary way.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And there are many such proposals in the literature,
&gt; &gt; &gt; including Jerry Hobb's 'promiscuous ontology' which Ive mentioned
&gt; &gt; &gt; before in these discussions, the fairly standard 'event' 
&gt; ontological
&gt; &gt; &gt; style based on case grammar, where a mere predication is 
&gt; rendered as
&gt; &gt; &gt; an existence claim plus a collection of binary case 
&gt; relations (agent,
&gt; &gt; &gt; object, patient, time, place, ....), the Sanskrit 
&gt; variation, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; various ideas of 'thirdness' arising from Pierce's 
&gt; philosophy. All of
&gt; &gt; &gt; these can be seen as ways of extending the ontology - 
&gt; introducing new
&gt; &gt; &gt; kinds of entities in addition to the things that yer average naive
&gt; &gt; &gt; realist might think of - in order to allow finer ways of
&gt; &gt; &gt; distinguishing ways that things can be true which are more subtle
&gt; &gt; &gt; than the starkly simple crudity of being in a set.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: But I haven't seen (or at least not understood) anything yet that
&gt; &gt;required more than the membership of something in some set to "do the
&gt; &gt;business", plus some relation occurences (logic speak) and some
&gt; &gt;axioms/rules.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, Hobbs would argue that if you can something about x, then you 
&gt; have to allow that x exists. Sounds reasonable? OK, consider:
&gt; 1. Joe went to the store.
&gt; 2. Joe went to the store quickly.
&gt; 3. Joe went to the store by driving the car slowly.
&gt; Hobbs says that 2 and 3 are consistent since even slow driving is a 
&gt; fast way to get to the store. But he also says that being quick and 
&gt; being slow aren't consistent with each other. So, he says, we are 
&gt; forced into saying that there is something here which is slow - the 
&gt; driving - and something ELSE which isn't slow - the going. So what 
&gt; seems like one event (and occupies the same spatiotemporal envelope) 
&gt; is in fact at least two 'things'. In fact it can be arbitrarily many 
&gt; 'things' depending on how much you feel like saying about it. Notice, 
&gt; this isn't a way of putting the same thing into a number of different 
&gt; sets; it forces many different things to exist in order to be the 
&gt; things that these various ways of talking can be *about*.

MW: This sounds to me like needing to understand the context. You were
saying elsewhere that with a linguistic approach you need to be able to
juggle the way people can. In effect, the "object in context" becomes what
you are describing, not the object simpliciter. To get away from that you
need to make the context explicit, so that descriptions can be come absolute
(quick and slow are relative words anyway). They can then be given a
linguistic interpretation in context, once the context is established.
