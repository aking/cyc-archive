Dear John,

I'm glad you posted this, because I have been puzzled by the 
difference between inference (provability) and entailment 
for some time.

Below you give the difference by:

&gt;  1. Provability:  p is said to be _provable_ from A in some
&gt;     logical system L iff there are rules of inference that
&gt;     allow p to be derived by performing some operations on
&gt;     the statements of A to generate the statement p.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Entailment:  p is said to be _semantically entailed_ by
&gt;     A iff in any state of affairs (or universe of discourse,
&gt;     or possible world) for which all the statements of A are
&gt;     true, the statement p is also true.

Well I can see some difference, and that entailment should be
stronger, but I don't really understand the difference.

Presumably there are cases where something can be proved through
inference, but is not entailed. Could you give an example of
that please?

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; &gt;....  But what else?  My guess is that the division between
&gt; &gt;the two [axioms and rules of inference]
&gt; &gt;also reflects some fundamental unrecognized meta-axioms and or
&gt; &gt;meta-rules of inference upon which the proposed logic rests. 
&gt; &gt;Unrecognized assumptions that may come back to haunt the project.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, indeed.  Logicians usually make a distinction between
&gt; "provability" and "semantic entailment".  Suppose you have
&gt; a set of statements A and another statement p.  Then you can
&gt; define the two notions as follows:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Provability:  p is said to be _provable_ from A in some
&gt;     logical system L iff there are rules of inference that
&gt;     allow p to be derived by performing some operations on
&gt;     the statements of A to generate the statement p.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Entailment:  p is said to be _semantically entailed_ by
&gt;     A iff in any state of affairs (or universe of discourse,
&gt;     or possible world) for which all the statements of A are
&gt;     true, the statement p is also true.
&gt; 
&gt; This distinction is as old as Aristotle, but it was most
&gt; clearly formulated by the medieval Scholastics.  In particular,
&gt; William of Ockham's _Summa Totius Logicae_ is a very clear
&gt; statement of this distinction.  Aristotle, Ockham, and everybody
&gt; who read them, including Peirce, took semantic entailment as
&gt; the more fundamental notion and used it to justify their
&gt; rules of inference.
&gt; 
&gt; The situation was muddied at the end of the 19th century by
&gt; two prominent logicians who didn't do their homework:  Gottlob
&gt; Frege and Bertrand Russell.  Frege was an independent thinker,
&gt; who happened to invent the first complete system of inference
&gt; for first-order logic.  But he hadn't read Ockham or the other
&gt; logicians, and his approach was highly idiosyncratic.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of taking semantic entailment as the fundamental notion,
&gt; Frege took provability as fundamental and even claimed that
&gt; "truth" was too vague a notion to be used as a foundation
&gt; for logic.  Bertrand Russell fell hook, line, and sinker for
&gt; Frege's point of view, which he preached to the masses.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1935-36, Alfred Tarski introduced (or actually reintroduced)
&gt; semantic entailment as the more fundamental notion.  Tarski's
&gt; approach, which is usually called "model-theoretic semantics"
&gt; is equivalent to what Ockham and Peirce used as the foundation
&gt; for logic.  Tarski, in fact, did quote Aristotle as a precedent
&gt; for his approach, because he was fighting an uphill battle
&gt; against the Frege-Russell propaganda, which had taken firm root
&gt; in the early 20th century.
&gt; 
&gt; For an indication of how hard Tarski had to argue for his
&gt; position, see the "polemical remarks" in a paper that Tarski
&gt; wrote in 1944 to support his position:
&gt; 
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/tarski.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/tarski.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; I also summarize some of those points in my commentary:
&gt; 
&gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ms514.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ms514.htm</A> 
&gt; 
&gt; JP&gt;.... I'm not so sure rules of inference (for example) are
&gt; &gt;operations.  Maybe they are simply definitions of what 
&gt; constitute things
&gt; &gt;--the properties of things.  Something like that.  Does any 
&gt; of this make
&gt; &gt;sense?  I guess I'm just questioning the notion that logic 
&gt; is (or should
&gt; &gt;be) an account of how the transformation of things must 
&gt; necessarily (in
&gt; &gt;all possible worlds) be.  Maybe logic should be an account 
&gt; of what the
&gt; &gt;notions of "transformation" and "things" presuppose.
&gt; 
&gt; Aristotle, Ockham, Peirce, and Tarski would be sympathetic
&gt; to your concerns.  They developed their systems of logic
&gt; for the purpose of characterizing the more fundamental notion
&gt; of semantic entailment, which is based on the way the world
&gt; itself happens to be.
&gt; 
&gt; Frege and Russell, who had not read the literature, claimed
&gt; that logic was more fundamental and that no independent notion
&gt; of truth or semantic entailment was necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; Today, logicians have gone back to the Aristotelian-Scholastic
&gt; point of view, but they usually credit it to Tarski, who waged
&gt; the hardest battles against the mistakes of Frege and Russell.
