Bob,

 

                  Currently we have two classes of documents on the SUO web
site at <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org">http://suo.ieee.org</A> &lt;<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/">http://suo.ieee.org/</A>&gt; :

 

1.          Documents being worked on by this working group(Merged Ontology
is only one listed)

2.          Papers and other documented submitted by members. 

 

It sounds like the second category is what you are referring to in your
motion, yet you use the words: "Document being worked on by this Working
Group."  

 

MW: I don't think we really have more than one group of documents yet,
despite and because of the vote we have had. 

 

I see no way a WG can be "working on" a document without group approval to
do so.  What if it's out of scope, or if all but one person doesn't want the
group to spend any time on it?  What if it violates a copyright or its
contributors don't follow IEEE rules of fairness, openness, or due process?


 

MW: At the early stage I don't think these concerns are relevant. If it is
irrelevant, that will be the kind of issue that is raised against it (we
will need some way of logging issues).  People will simply vote with their
feet. If a document is good it will attract people to work on it, if it
isn't it will just sit there doing no harm, but logging a contribution.

 

It's fine for people to submit documents and unofficially have members work
on them (that's how documents get started), but we need to be clear whether
a document is under WG control or not, i.e. whether the WG is working on the
document or whether it's just the work of some individuals.   There's a
significant difference. 

 

MW: I disagree. In fact there is almost no difference. All the good
standards documents I have seen have been developed by a small group of
people and submitted to a wider community for review from time to time.
Control by a small group is a practical necessity, as is being subject from
time to time to first informal review, and later formal review. 

 

                  So, if you are proposing that anyone may submit a document
and individuals can unofficially work on it, we permit and encourage that
now.  If you are proposing that a single individual can commit the WG to
work on a document, I see major problems as stated above.

-------------------

                  The Merged Ontology could be get company at any time.
Documents from Matthew West, Nicola Guarino, Robert Kent, and Philip Jackson
(Glossary) have all been possible candidates.  I have discussed this option
with each of these individuals (to bring their documents into the group, and
under group control).          

 

MW: And I have not done so because I do not think that it is any more useful
than I think putting Ian's document under formal control is. Although I also
note that what I have done does not even apparently merit being mentioned on
the "B" list. 

----------------------

                  Regarding the concern with the supposed 'status' of the
Merged Ontology, on a scale of 0-10, its status is probably no more than a
1.  It will need to pass multiple votes as a Working Draft, then a vote by
this WG to forward for Sponsor Ballot, and then pass (by 75%) the Sponsor
Ballot.     

 

MW: I agree, another reason why it should not be under formal control yet.
In my view it needs to get to about 5 before that is really worthwhile.

 

Jim Schoening

Jon. John, Chris, Graham, 

Thank you for your comments.  I have drafted a motion that I will eventually
offer for general consent (unanimous consent).  I think it is what most
people thought there were approving in the previous "straw vote". 

I invite any comments or suggestions. I would very much like this to pass
without objection.  However, a single objection defeats a motion for general
consent.  If it cannot be accepted by general consent, I will offer it as a
motion requiring a vote. 

Bob 
  
  

Motion:  Request for adoption by general (unanimous) consent. 

Resolved: Any member of the IEEE SUO Working Group may post a document to
the SUO web page as a "Document being worked on by this Working Group."  The
member who posts a document is presumptively the technical editor of the
document and by posting agrees to perform this role or alternatively name
another member who agrees to perform the role of technical editor.  No vote
will be required to post a document or name an editor. 

The statement  "All documents posted are deemed to have equal status and no
document has any preferred position over any other document." will precede
the list of documents.
