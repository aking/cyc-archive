Jon,

	If I haven't responded to some of your criticisms in the past, it
was because I couldn't understand them.  If they still apply to the current
version of the Merged Ontology and if you can state them in a form that I
can grasp, I will sincerely do my best to respond to them.

-Ian

&gt; 
&gt; Adam,
&gt; 
&gt; My note was addressed to Jim.  I try to accord people the respect
&gt; that they accord me, modulo the mistakes that all of us make from
&gt; time to time.  I am speaking as sincerely as I can afford to, and
&gt; I simply have no way of being certain what some people are up to
&gt; from their conduct, if it does not fit with models that I know,
&gt; and so there is a lot of guessing from imperfect data that one
&gt; has to do.  Many times you and Ian have signed off with the
&gt; conventional request for feedback, and I simply cannot say
&gt; it any other way than to say that these sorts of requests
&gt; no longer strike me as sincere.  Nobody has to take all
&gt; the advice that is offered them, of course, but I think
&gt; that I summarize the situation fairly accurately when
&gt; I say that even my most prosaic remarks about rather
&gt; cut and dried logical errors, even when reinforced by
&gt; other observers, have yet to be answered in any one
&gt; of the several ways that I would generally expect
&gt; from people who are genuinely concerned about
&gt; solving rather obvious problems.  These sorts
&gt; of communication gaps do engender mistrust.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the reasons that I have started to emphasize
&gt; the obstacle-identifying, problem-solving approach to
&gt; our mission is that the solution to a genuine problem,
&gt; one that is concurrently faced by the whole discipline,
&gt; is not the sort of thing that can be faked, talked around,
&gt; or worn down into submission, the way that a shakey accord
&gt; by way of political niceties of procedure, even the way that
&gt; ultimate compliance with a pro forma standard, can be rigged.
&gt; Consequently I think that facing up to genuine problems, the
&gt; kind that it benefits everybody to solve, in the long-run
&gt; at least, is one way to keep everybody honest, thereby to
&gt; encourage a sense of common purpose, and to direct the
&gt; majority of our considerable energies at something
&gt; beyond each other.  Just my current sense of it.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours Truly,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey

&gt; &gt; Jon,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have to say this is quite unfair both in tone and in substance and
&gt; &gt; seems in conflict with your signature.  When anyone has pointed out
&gt; &gt; a specific criticism of the Merged Ontology, we've always and will
&gt; &gt; continue to do our best to provide specific and detailed response
&gt; &gt; either as to why we may disagree, or a clear statement of agreement
&gt; &gt; and intention to change the problematic content.  As to the contents
&gt; &gt; we've offered being at the level of high-school programming, that
&gt; &gt; doesn't to seem to me either an accurate or a constructive comment.
&gt; &gt; Plain speaking can be constructive, and need not be pejorative as
&gt; &gt; are the comments below.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Adam
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do I mean?  Well, here's a typical sort of example:
&gt; &gt; &gt; Every now and again, Adam or Ian will trot out some bit
&gt; &gt; &gt; of a "Problem in KIF" for our exercise, like some proud
&gt; &gt; &gt; housecats dumping a near-vanquished mouse at our door.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They actually seem to have impressed themselves with
&gt; &gt; &gt; these miniscule productions.  But when two or three
&gt; &gt; &gt; people have pointed out the glaring blunders that
&gt; &gt; &gt; any high school programmer would be ashamed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; miss, well, they vanish without a word of
&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks, and with the general attitude of
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Well, who asked you, anywho!?"
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, I take this a mark of a certain type of person,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I do not come to regard it as an ominous sign,
&gt; &gt; &gt; at least, not until I see you appearing, through
&gt; &gt; &gt; omission or otherwise, to collude in that spirit.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I am still a rank novice when it comes to plain speaking,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and so I hope that you will not take offense at the manner in
&gt; &gt; &gt; which I have stumbled to express my concerns.  I still have
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fullest confidence in the mission.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Respectfully Submitted,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
