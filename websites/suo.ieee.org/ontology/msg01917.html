Hi John, thanks for your comments and suggestions.

John Velman wrote:
&gt; 1. Reference numbers, and KIF global syntax.
&gt;
&gt; It appears that there is a global syntax convention that (discussion
&gt; "xxx") preceeds the actual axiom, theorem, or definition that is being
&gt; discussed.  Can we count on this?  (If this is docmumented, I missed
&gt; it.)

It isn't documented.

&gt; If so, this might be a good place to start putting in reference
&gt; identifiers of some kind.  Of course, putting reference identifiers on
&gt; material that is in an early stage of development has a lot of
&gt; problems, but it certainly would facilitate discussion.

I completely agree.  In fact, some sort of reference scheme is essential
if documentation statements are to be included as object language
statements in KIF, because it is currently just an artifact of the
"source code" that documentation statements are placed immediately prior
to the axioms they document.  Logically, there is no order to things in
an ontology -- it's just a set of sentences, so there needs to be a more
robust mechanism for attaching documentation to axioms, theorems, and
definitions.  Moreover, a reference scheme shouldn't imply any
particular sequential order for the axioms, as we would have to
renumber every time we inserted an axiom somewhere.  Hence, I'm inclined
(following Pat Hayes) toward developing some sort of "wrapper" for
ontology axioms (definitions, theorems) that encloses both the axiom and
its documentation and which avoids numerical references (or at least,
avoids using them in any way that implies any sequential ordering of the
elements of the ontology), e.g.:

{
REFNAME: sequence-extensionality
STATEMENT-TYPE: axiom
DOCUMENTATION: "Sequences are extensional, i.e., sequences with the same elements in the same order are identical."
CONTENT:

(forall (?seq1 ?seq2 (sequence ?seq1) (sequence ?seq2))
        (=&gt; (forall (?n ?x)
                    (&lt;=&gt; (?seq1 ?n ?x) (?seq2 ?n ?x)))
            (= ?seq1 ?seq2)))
}

Or something like that.

&gt; 3. Some confusion results from the order in which things are
&gt; presented, and lack of clear statements as to what is primative.
&gt; Some things that are stated as axioms or theorems seem to either be or
&gt; need definitions.

I used "definition" when a term was axiomatized with a biconditional,
and hence theoretically dispensable, but was not consistent on this
point, as I was more concerned with the content than the documentation.
(As you note, I didn't call the axiom for "unary" a definition, for
instance.)  However, theoretically, definitions are just a type of
axiom, so marking something as a definition rather than an axiom is
mostly just for heuristic value.  Again, the "documentation" mechanism
needs to be pretty thoroughly revamped in any case.

&gt; The theorem on unions of classes struck me as lacking a definition of
&gt; union -- but I found it later on.   I'm still looking for the
&gt; definition of 'empty.'

I called it an axiom, but, to be consistent, should have called it a
definition.  I also realize that I've been using "null" to mean both the
null class and to mean "empty" in a couple of emails with Robert
Meersman, which has no doubt left him and others confused.  Here's the
axiom ("definition") for "empty":

(forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
        (&lt;=&gt; (empty ?rel)
             (not (exists (@args) (?rel @args)))))

&gt; 4. There is a level of abstraction (or something!) here that I had
&gt; trouble with---not wrong, just confusing to the unwary.  Like Matthew,
&gt; I was stopped for a good long time over (class relation).

It is not really a matter of abstraction.  I think that what is probably
unfamiliar to some folks here is that you can talk about anything,
including classes, in KIF.  In particular:  relations are classes, hence
(instance-of relation class), which, given than classes are properties,
is equivalent to (class relation).

&gt; 5. Well, to help sort out whether or not I'm on the right track, here
&gt; is a paraphrase of some of the content.  Any corrections or objections
&gt; will be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; I'll try to do some KIF, but ...
&gt;
&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; ;;  Primatives
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  The language includes (in addition to the bare KIF syntax)
&gt; ;;  logical connectives, and the following primatives:
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  relation
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  instance-of
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  particular
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  -- I've thrown in the term 'particular' since particulars seem to be
&gt; ;;  lurking
&gt; ;;  in the background.  I'm not sure this is essential at this stage, but
&gt; ;;  I'm more comfortable including them.
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;  Well formed expressions --

This is made explicit in a BNF.  Since the current KIF BNF is in flux at
the moment as it is being worked on, I didn't include one.

&gt; ;; We need to know that if (relation ?rel) then (?rel @args) is well
&gt; ;; formed if and only if @args has one or more entries.

"@args" is just a variable.  It doesn't have "entries".  (TERM @FOO) is
always well formed, for any term TERM and any row variable @FOO.

&gt; (documentation "Axiom: only relations can be truly predicated of other
&gt; things")
&gt; (forall (?r @args)
&gt;      (=&gt; (?r @args)
&gt;          (relation ?r)))

You saw this in the ontology, right?

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  instance-of is an instance of relation")
&gt; (instance-of instance-of relation)

This is already theorem of the ontology.  We can prove, e.g.,
(instance-of null top).  Hence, by the preceding axiom, we have
(relation instance-of), and by the axiom for instance-of we have
(instance-of instance-of relation).

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  particular is an instance of relation")
&gt; (instance-of particular relation)

Will be a theorem if you can derive an instance of (particular FOO).

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  relation is an instance of  relation")
&gt; (instance-of relation relation)

This is a theorem.

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Everything is either a relation or a particular")
&gt;
&gt; (forall (?x) (or ((relation ?x) (particular ?x))
&gt;
&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Nothing is both a relation and a particular")
&gt;
&gt; (forall (?x) (not
&gt;                (and (relation ?x)  (particular ?x))))

Sounds reasonable.

&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt; ;;  It is unclear to me why unary and binary were given as AXIOMS rather
&gt; ;;  than as DEFINITIONS.   It seems to me they should be defined.
&gt; ;;  Alternatively, one makes these primative terms, and then gives AXIOMS.
&gt; ;;  BUt why not just define them?

Again, a definition is an axiom of a certain sort.  But you are right
that, had I been consistent, I would have marked these as definitions.

&gt; ;;  In either case, at this point in the development we can
&gt; ;;  go from here to a definiton (or axiomatization?) of arity of relations,

That's already been done; not sure what you are suggesting.

&gt; ;;  and the other definitions and theorems in the section on BASIC RELATION
&gt; ;;  THEORY  (except, of course, those that refer to classes).
&gt; ;;
&gt; ;;   I think the following are axioms:

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM  relation is a unary relation")
&gt; (unary relation)

This already follows from (class relation) and the axiom that sez that
classes are unary.

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM  particular is a unary relation")
&gt; (unary particular)

Will also follow from (class particular).

&gt; (documentation "AXIOM instance-of is a binary relation")

This already follows from the axiom (signature instance-of top class).

&gt; Now the material on classes is largely covered by the material on
&gt; relations.

I believe it already was.

&gt; I hope I'm on more or less the right track.

Looks good to me.

&gt; I heartily recommend trying to write some KIF as an aid to
&gt; learning the language.

Good advice!
