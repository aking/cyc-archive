I sympathize with Phil Jackson's goal, but I don't like the terms
"regular" and "irregular":

&gt; One other point to make is that the concept of "contest" is related to
&gt; "game", which many people (Wittgenstein, Rosch, Lakoff, ...) argue is an
&gt; "irregular concept", i.e. not susceptible to a single, logical definition,
&gt; and needing to some extent to be described by a collection of examples,
&gt; exceptions, prototypes, etc. This ties in with the ideas of mining
&gt; ontologies, and describing ontologies via associations, ontology maps, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; To better represent the range of real world concepts, we may need to develop
&gt; a framework for "heterogenous concept representation", which allows
&gt; intermixing regular and irregular concept definitions, i.e. giving a
&gt; definition / description of a (regular / irregular) concept in terms of
&gt; other concepts, each of which may be regular or irregular. Such a framework
&gt; may also need to allow use of metaphorical mechanisms to define / describe
&gt; new concepts in terms of others.

As more accurate terms for describing the two kinds of concepts,
I would suggest "natural" and "technical".  Wittgenstein's point
was that *every* naturally occurring concept is irregular in the
above sense, and that the only terms that are not irregular are
the ones that have been artificially defined for a particular
technical purpose.

Even in science (including mathematics and computer technology)
most terms are "natural" or "irregular" except when they are
formally defined for a specific purpose, whose scope lasts
only for the duration of a single book, article, manual,
or computer program.

As examples, consider the terms "space" and "time" in ordinary
language, Newtonian mechanics, Einstein's relativity, and more
recent theories of cosmology.  People who have taken a course in
physics often equate Newtonian "absolute time" with "common sense",
but Newton himself had to argue against the "relativistic time",
which he believed was "common among the vulgar".  But what Newton
considered "vulgar" is today considered "advanced physics", and
most of the people in the world (considering the so called third
world nations as the majority) have concepts of time that are
very different from the ones that are "common sense" for people
who have grown up with clocks and schedules.

In mathematics, consider the concept of "number", whose definition
has gone through many twists and turns in mathematics books over the
past 2500 years and took even more radical twists and turns during
the 20th century, especially in the latter half with all of the many
different definitions that have cropped up in computer systems.

I was recently looking at a book about SQL (the O'Reilly book
_SQL in a Nutshell_), which included a comparison of the definitions
of datatypes (including numbers) in the SQL92 standard, the SQL99
standard, and four different implementations of SQL, none of which
exactly conformed to the definitions in either of the two "standards".

If physicists can't agree on a single definition of "space" and
"time" and mathematicians can't agree on a single definition
of "number", it is very difficult to imagine any concepts that
might be called "regular".

John Sowa

PS:  This discussion, by the way, is a brief version of one of the
main themes of Chapter 6 (on Knowledge Soup) in my KR book.
