In the beginning ...

| Things are equivocally named, when they have the name only in common,
| the definition (or statement of essence) corresponding with the name
| being different.  For instance, while a man and a portrait can properly
| both be called "animals" [Greek 'zõon' means 'living' or 'true to life'],
| these are equivocally named.  For they have the name only in common,
| the definitions (or statements of essence) corresponding with the name
| being different.  For if you are asked to define what the being an animal
| means in the case of the man and the portrait, you give in either case
| a definition appropriate to that case alone.  ("Categories", page 13).

Semeiontologists,

The word "intension" has recently come to be stressed in our discussions.
As I first learned this word from my reading of Leibniz, I shall take it
to be nothing more than a synonym for "property" or "quality", and shall
probably always associate it with the primes factorization of integers,
the analogy between having a factor and having a property being one of
the most striking, at least to my neo-pythagorean compleated mystical
sensitivities, that Leibniz ever posed, and of which certain facets
of Peirce's work can be taken as a further polishing up, if one is
of a mind to do so.

As I dare not presume this to constitute the common acceptation
of the term "intension", not without checking it out, at least,
I will need to try and understand how others here understand
the term and all of its various derivatives, thereby hoping
to anticipate, that is to say, to evade or to intercept,
a few of the brands of late-breaking misunderstandings
that are so easy to find ourselves being surprised by,
if one shies away from asking silly questions at the
very first introduction of one of these parvenu words.
I have been advised that it will probably be fruitless
to ask direct questions of my informants in such a regard,
but I do not see how else to catalyze the process of exposing
the presumption that "it's just understood" when in fact it may
be far from being so, and thus to clear the way for whatever real
clarification might possibly be forthcoming, in the goodness of time.
Just to be open, and patent, and completely above the metonymous board,
I will lay out the paradigm that I myself bear in mind when I think about
how I might place the locus and the sense of this term "intension", because
I see the matter of where to lodge it in our logical logistic as being quite
analogous to the issue of where to place those other i-words, namely, "idea",
capitalized or not, "impresssion", "intelligible concept", and "interpretant".

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Let me illustrate what I think that a lot of our controversies
about nominalism versus realism actually boil down to in practice.
From a semiotic or a sign-theoretic point of view, it all begins
with a case of "plural reference", which happens when a sign 's'
is quite literally taken to denote each object o&lt;j&gt; in a whole
collection of objects {o&lt;1&gt;, ..., o&lt;k&gt;, ...}, a situation that
I would normally represent in a sign-relational table like so:

  Object     Sign     Interp
¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
    o1        's'       ...
    o2        's'       ...
    o3        's'       ...
¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

For the moment, it does not matter what the interpretants are.

I would like to diagram this somewhat after the following fashion,
here detailing just the denotative component of the sign relation,
that is, the 2-adic relation that is obtained by "projecting out"
the Object and the Sign columns of the table.

    o1 ------&gt;
              \
               \
    o2 ------&gt;--@ 's'
               /
              /
    o3 ------&gt;

I would like to -- but my personal limitations in the
Art of ASCII Hieroglyphics do not permit me to maintain
this level of detail as the figures begin to ramify much
beyond this level of complexity.  Therefore, let me use
the following device to symbolize the same configuration:

¤~~~Object~Domain~~~¤~~~~Sign~Domain~~~~¤

    o   o   o &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 's'

¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

Notice the subtle distinction between these two cases:

1.  A sign denotes each object in a set of objects.

2.  A sign denotes a set of objects.

The first option uses the notion of a set in a casual,
informal, or metalinguistic way, and does not really
commit us to the existence of sets in any formal way.
This is the more razoresque choice, much less risky,
ontologically speaking, and so we may adopt it as
our starting position.

Now, in this "plural denotative" component of the sign relation,
we are looking at what may be seen as a functional relationship,
in the sense that we ahve a piece of some function f : O -&gt; S,
such that f(o1) = f(o2) = f(o3) = 's', for example.  Functions
always admit of factoring into an "onto" (no relation) map and
then a one-one map, as we discussed what seems like an age ago.

But where do the intermediate entities go?  We could lodge them
in a brand new space all their own, but Ockham the Innkeeper is
right up there with Old Procrustes when it comes to the amenity
of his accommodations, and so we feel compelled to at least try
shoving them into one or another of the spaces already reserved.

In the rest of this discussion, let us give the name "i" to the
intermediate entity between the objects o&lt;j&gt; and the sign 's'.

Now should you annex i to the object domain O, you will have
instantly given yourself away as having "Realist" tendencies,
and you might as well go ahead and call it an "intension" or
even an "Idea" of the grossly subtlest Platonic brand, since
you are about to booted from Ockham's Establishment, and you
might as well have the comforts of your Ideals in your exile.

¤~~~Object~Domain~~~¤~~~~Sign~Domain~~~~¤

        i
       /|\   *
      / | \       *
     /  |  \           *
    o   o   o &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 's'

¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

But if you assimilate i to the realm of signs S, you will
be showing your inclination to remain within the straight
and narrow of "Conceptualist" or even "Nominalist" dogmas,
and you may read this "i" as standing for an intelligible
concept, or an "idea" of the safely decapitalized, mental
impression variety.

¤~~~Object~Domain~~~¤~~~~Sign~Domain~~~~¤

    o   o   o &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 's'
        .  .  .             |
             . . .          |
                  ...       |
                       .    |
                           'i'

¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

But if you dare to be truly liberal, you might just find
that you can easily afford to accommmodate the illusions
of both of these types of intellectual inclinations, and
after a while you begin to wonder how all of that mental
or ontological downsizing got started in the first place.

¤~~~Object~Domain~~~¤~~~~Sign~Domain~~~~¤

        i
       /|\   *
      / | \       *
     /  |  \           *
    o   o   o &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 's'
        .  .  .             |
             . . .          |
                  ...       |
                       .    |
                           'i'

¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤

And this is a picture that I think will
merit a bit of your earnest reflections.

Many Regards, In Deed,

Jon Awbrey
