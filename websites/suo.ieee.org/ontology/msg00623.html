I stumbled into these postings backwards:

1) In responding to Jim's query about my "NO" vote 
   I sent him a little list of potential
   "show stoppers" I'd been accumulating.
   I had a long list (circa 10 items) because 
   I prefer to decouple these concerns 
   as much as possible.
  
2) Jim suggested that I post my list.
   Instead I tried to "vet" each assertion of a
   "show stopper" by contacting someone I thought 
   could help me make the assertion clear, and who
   thought that there's really a fundamental flaw. 
   Regrettably, I didn't copy Jim.

3) Jim forwarded the unvetted version of the list to Ian.

4) Folks I'd contacted began not only reporting to me
   whether the assertion was well-stated but also their
   commentary on the assertion.  
   In particular, Ian responded extensively, to Jim and me.
   
4) I found myself faced with a rapidly-closing window
   of opportunity and a problem.  
   I chose to post, in a standard format,
   all the supposed fundamental flaws for which I had received 
    - an affirmation that the assertion is 
         meaningful and has an advocate or
    - commentary to me that I felt should be "on the record".
   

The hope and intent is 
  --to put stuff I was sitting on, onto the record (quickly)
  --to provide a vehicle whereby these issues can be driven to closure.

Closure would be achieved if people
simply respond with an "AGREE"/"YES" or a "DISAGREE"/"NO".

If these assertions are *all* rejected ("DISAGREE"/"NO"), 
then that universal rejection would tend to constitute a 
"green light" for the Merged Ontology as a suitable 
origin/basis of the IEEE SUO.

 
   Sincerely,
    -Fred Chase

Fred,
        I am forwarding these points to Ian, who (I'm sure) is prepared to
address them.

Jim,

I certainly see a lot of good coming out of work on Ian's Merged Ontology
and 
work on it is currently our most effective vector for progress.

But there have been on the order of ten difficulties with the Merged
Ontology asserted to be "show-stoppers".
By show-stopper, I mean a fundamental flaw requiring that the entire
approach be pretty much set aside as unusable.

Following are my current notes on potential show-stoppers.

1) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO be able to represent time
and change (Pat Hayes)

2) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO be able to represent
alternative courses of reality (Pat Hayes)

3) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have no incommensurate views
on basic ontological issues (Pat Hayes)

4) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have no unrelated views on
basic ontological issues (Pat Hayes)

5) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have a 4D orientation rather
than a 3D foundation  (Matthew West)

6) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO have no n-th Domain
(Matthew West)

7) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO include a means for
articulation of domains of interest for subtending ontologies

8) It is absoultely essential that the IEEE SUO be an *example* of an upper
level which can be adapted, extended, or partly disabled  (Josiah Auspitz)


My  "no" was  procedural:  
Because of the extent of the potential show-stopper list it seemed safer to
1) work hard to develop and improve the Merged Ontology but
2) not expose ourselves to the embarassment of having an evolving standard
which later is shown
   to be fundamentally flawed (thus the preference to call it a WP, not a
draft standard)
3) have a proponent of each alleged show-stopper 
     i) sharpen the relevant statement above 
     ii) lead or at least be active in a discussion of the issue
     iii) abide by a vote on the issue


I don't want to obstruct progress
and so if, after cogitating a bit on the above, you'd still recommend a YES,
I'm content to vote that way.

    Regards,
     -Fred

&gt;         I am preparing comments for resolution.  I interpret your comments
&gt; as suggestions for improvements, which we will be resolved after the group
&gt; decides if it wants to work on this document or not.  Is this OK by you?

&gt; SUO,
&gt; 
&gt; I vote NO (re establishing Ian Niles' Merged Ontology as a base document),
&gt; 
&gt; reasoning as follows.
&gt; 
&gt; The group is in a productive challenge-response mode.
&gt; The Merged Ontology should be a working paper.
&gt; Formal votes should be taken, after discussion, on each
&gt; of the several ways it is claimed to be fundamentally flawed:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Requirement for a representation of time and change,
&gt; 2) Requirement for a representation of  alternative courses of reality,
&gt; 3) Disallowance of incommensurate views unrelated to one another,
&gt; 4) .....
