Paul,

Still in the process of getting my e-legs back
after a goodly time spent airing out the space
between my ears, but here are some random bits
of free associative nitworking:

Subj:  All Liar, No Paradox

From:  Jon Awbrey &lt;jawbrey@oakland.edu&gt;
  To:  [Peirce Subgroup]

Re Jim's question:

&gt; Perhaps the liar's paradox can not be reduced to diagrammatic form.
&gt; Why does this paradox seem to resist deductive analysis?  Is there
&gt; something in the purpose or context of the premises that is at the
&gt; root of the problem?  Is there something about asserting ones own
&gt; context, or denying one speaks from a context that is at the bottom
&gt; of this paradox?

Jim,

According to my understanding of it, the so-called Liar Paradox
is just the most simple-minded of fallacies, involving nothing
more mysterious than the acceptance of a false assumption,
from which anybody can prove anything at all.

Consider one of the forms in which it is commonly presented:

| Somebody writes down:
|
| &gt; 1.  Statement 1 is false.
| 
| Then you are led to reason:
| If Statement 1 is false then
| by the principle that permits
| the substitution of equals in
| a true statement to obtain
| yet another true statement,
| one can derive the result:
|
| &quot;Statement 1 is false&quot; is false.
| Ergo, Statement 1 is true,
| and so on, and so on,
| ad nauseum infinitum.

Where did you go wrong?
Where were you misled?

As it happens, graphical reasoning does help
to clear this up -- at least, it did for me --
if only because the process of translating
the purported reasoning into another form
gave me a clue where the wool was pulled.

Just here, to wit, where it is writ:

&gt; 1.  Statement 1 is false.

What is this really saying?
Well, it's the same as writing:

&gt; Statement 1.  Statement 1 is false.

And what the heck does this dot.comment say?
It is inducing you to accept this identity:

&gt; &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Statement 1 is false&quot;.

That appears to be a purely syntactic indexing,
the sort of thing you are led to believe that
you can do arbitrarily, with logical impunity.
But you cannot, for syntactic identity implies
logical equivalence, and that is liable to find
itself constrained by iron bands of logical law.

And you cannot just assume what this result says:

&gt; &quot;Statement 1&quot; = &quot;Negation of Statement 1&quot;

To write the last step in the form that I like:

&gt; (( Statement_1 , ( Statement_1 ) ))

And this my friends, call it &quot;Statement 0&quot;,
is purely and simply a false statement,
with no hint of paradox about it.

Statement 0 was slipped into your drink
before you were even starting to think.
A bit before you were led to substitute
you should have examined more carefully
the site proposed for the substitution!

For the principle that you rushed to use
does not permit you to substitute unequals
into a statement that is false to begin with,
not just in the first place, but even before,
in the zeroth place of argument, as it were,
and still expect to come up with a truth.

Now, let that be the end of that.

Jon

I was reminded of this old note of mine, initially
addressed to some denizens of the Peirce List, by
Jay Halcomb's remarks on the need to distinguish
&quot;syntactic&quot;, &quot;semantic&quot;, and dare I add &quot;pragmatic&quot;
brands of inconsistency affecting our formal systems.
Just by way of tossing yet another file into the ointment,
I thought that this humble example, aside from booting the
Liar beyond the reaches of our Architectronic Bootstraps,
might also serve to illustrate just how tricky it can be
to perform the required dissection.

By the way, I forgot to include the Figure,
which was critical to seeing the solution,
so here it is:

              S1
              •
              |
       S1     |
        •-----•
         \   /
          \ /
           •
           |
           |
           @

   (( S1 , ( S1 ) ))

Figure 0.  Statement 0

&gt; T.1.1:  There is a claim on the table (somewhere) that ALL unsolvable formal problems are
&gt; solvable formally by altering (sometimes only so slightly) the axioms or/and inference rules.
&gt; Related to this claim are many well established schools of thought -- including the work of
&gt; Godel, Church, and Penrose -- as well as others (A. Zenkin - D. Pospelov) on the limitations
&gt; of formalism.  I can discuss this claim if someone wishes.
&gt;
&gt; T.1.2:  There are the concerns of linguists such as Ben Whorf (non-translatability
&gt; of some natural language tokens for specific source to target languages), or such
&gt; as the later Wittgenstein.  Here we have a direct cause of the distinction between
&gt; &quot;machine addressable&quot; and &quot;non-machine addressable&quot; subjects as defined now in the
&gt; Topic Maps conceptual model.  Again, this distinction is why we of us have judged
&gt; that Topic Maps has the **potential** for doing something that XML with RDF or KIF
&gt; or UML will not -- because they cannot.
&gt;
&gt; T.1.3:  One must go outside the &quot;first system&quot; -- but IF this is an infinite
&gt; regression, ... then one never actually left the first system -- now did we?
&gt; One needs an &quot;epistemic gap&quot;.

&gt; reflecting also the work of Drs. Peter Kugler and
&gt; Robert Shaw (Einstein Institute) and others)
&gt;

&gt; such as Jon addresses and which I have addressed, here and elsewhere, on occasion.

&gt; T.2.1:  <A  HREF="http://www.ontologystream.com/admin/strategy.htm">http://www.ontologystream.com/admin/strategy.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt; T.2.2:  The reduction of the phenomenon of human knowledge to discrete economic terms
&gt; can not go the way that commercialism has made with a very real (pragmatic?) reduction
&gt; of moral and social values to purely monetary terms.
&gt;
&gt; T.2.2.1:  First, because human knowledge is not &quot;real&quot; in the sense of something
&gt; that can be divided (fractionated) and made into a commodity (this is a BCNGroup
&gt; knowledge claim -- and we welcome the validation exercise.)

Here is an excerpt from my dissertation on the definition of &quot;real&quot; that I use,
and that I recommend for your consideration.  It is borrowed from C.S. Peirce,
who took the trouble to trace the concept back to its initial sources in the
works of the Medieval Scholastics:

Subj:  Re: Factorization Issues
Date:  Mon, 27 Nov 2000 10:30:18 -0500
From:  Jon Awbrey &lt;jawbrey@oakland.edu&gt;
  To:  Conceptual Graphs &lt;cg@cs.uah.edu&gt;,
       Stand Up Ontology &lt;standard-upper-ontology@ieee.org&gt;

I was going to open by saying that I came here not
to prove the reality of universals but to bury it --
but I suppose that the e-voked potential irony of that
would only serve to render even my ideal renderer more
suspicious in his or her or its hermenetics of my text.

So let me go back to how I began, and see if I can detect
any chad or detente of my &quot;intially intended indent&quot; (III):

&gt; I would like to introduce a concept that I find to be of
&gt; use in discussing the problems of hypostatic abstraction,
&gt; reification, the reality of universals, and the questions
&gt; of choosing among nominalism, conceptualism, and realism,
&gt; generally.

Okay, I still like the sound of that.  And I believe that it
fairly states my actual intent, which is to put my own bases
and biases away in ever so slightly leaky brackets -- &quot;e-poches&quot;,
to kern a phrase -- and to return once again to that e-ternally
recurring &quot;Dream of Leibniz&quot; (DOL) -- dreams can be good things
in my morpheology and in my oneirontology! -- and to tease out
the sort of equipotential framework in which every perspective
has at least a minimal representation, if not always a totally
unskewed prospection.

So the only &quot;proof of concept&quot;, in other words, the simple &quot;test of idea&quot;
that I am suggesting for this notion of factorization is that it ought to
&quot;be of use in discussing the problems of hypostatic abstraction, reification,
the reality of universals, and the questions of choosing among nominalism,
conceptualism, and realism, generally&quot;.  Even if I thought, as I do, that
the practical necessity of thinking in terms of &quot;real generals&quot; cannot be
escaped, I have long ago given up on the idea that this realization can be
forced on actually finitary communities, interpreters, persons, or whatever,
in a finite spell of time.

In sum, I am seeking an &quot;approximately level playing area&quot; (ALPA) --
not quite the same thing as the dream of a &quot;god's eye view&quot; (GEV)
or the gratuity of an &quot;ontologically hermeneutral language&quot; (OHL),
though perhaps just as illusuory a quest as any other cut of chase --
the sort of mat-e-matical ring that the various contestants would
not automaticaly feel is preclusive to their interest in wrestling.

So, it is, after all, more a matter of gymnastics
than all those other brands of Socratic exercises.

However, if and when I do get around to straightforwardly tackling
this problem about the &quot;reality of universals&quot;, then my claims on
the title of &quot;reality&quot; would be wholly contingent on a particular
definition of that term, and my use of the word &quot;real&quot;, along with
its cognates and its derivatives, might be explained a bit like this,
in the way that I gloss the theme of &quot;reality&quot; in the following excerpt
from my diss, from a passage about half-way through Subsection 1.3.4.14
&quot;Application of OF [Objective Framework]:  Generic Level&quot; -- if you do
not mind jumping just a little bit abruptly into the middle of things:

| In spite of the apparent duality between these patterns of
| composition, there is a significant asymmetry to be observed
| in the way that the insistent theme of realism interrupts the
| underlying genre.  To understand what this means, it is necessary
| to note that the strain of pragmatic thinking I am using here takes
| its definition of &quot;reality&quot; from the word's original Scholastic sources,
| where the adjective &quot;real&quot; means &quot;having properties&quot;.  Taken in this sense,
| &quot;reality&quot; is necessary but not sufficient to &quot;actuality&quot;, where the word
| &quot;actual&quot; means &quot;existing in act and not merely potentially&quot; (Webster's).
| To reiterate the same thing from the converse direction, actuality is
| sufficient but not necessary to reality.  The distinction between
| the two ideas is further pointed up by the fact that a potential
| can be real, and that its reality can be independent of any
| particular moment in which the power acts.
|
| These &quot;angelic doctrines&quot; would probably remain distant from
| the present concern, were it not for two points of connection:
|
| 1.  Relative to the present genre, the distinction of reality, that can
|     be granted to certain objects of thought and not to others, fulfills an
|     analogous role to the distinction that singles out &quot;sets&quot; among &quot;classes&quot;
|     in modern versions of set theory.  Taking the membership relation &quot;€&quot; as
|     a predecessor relation in a pre-designated hierarchy of classes, a class
|     attains the status of a set, and by dint of this becomes an object of
|     determinate discussion, simply if it has successors.  Pragmatic reality
|     is distinguished from both the medieval and the modern versions, however,
|     by the fact that its reality is always a reality to someone.  This is due
|     to the circumstance that it takes both an abstract property and a concrete
|     interpreter to establish the practical reality of an object.

&gt; T.2.2.2:  Second, because it would be an new moral outrage produced (again)
&gt; by a mind set that sees no moral or social values (those who insist that
&gt; everything is marketing.)
&gt; 
&gt; T.3:  The possibility of grounding knowledge technology in modern science.
&gt;
&gt; T.3.1:  We specifically mean NOT computer science, but sciences
&gt; that are not artificial in the sense that Herbert Simon talks about.
&gt; Biology, the new physics, ecological science, quantum mechanics,
&gt; astrophysics, etc.  These are the real sciences, not computer science.
&gt;
&gt; T.3.2:  The sciences that recognize and discover the essentially
&gt; stratified nature to the organization of processes and causes.
&gt;
&gt; T.3.3:  OF COURSE computer science is valuable,
&gt; but it (like economic theory) is not a science
&gt; in any full sense.
