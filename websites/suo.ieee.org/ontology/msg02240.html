&gt; Dear Jon,

| 3.  The Three Great Data Models
| 
| 3.1  The Relational Data Model
|
| The mathematical concept underlying the relational model
| is the set-theoretic 'relation', which is a subset of
| the Cartesian product of a list of domains.
|
| A 'domain' is simply a set of values.  ...
| The 'Cartesian product' of domains D&lt;1&gt;, D&lt;2&gt;, ..., D&lt;k&gt;,
| written  D&lt;1&gt; x D&lt;2&gt; x ... x D&lt;k&gt;, is the set of all k-tuples
| (v&lt;1&gt;, ..., v&lt;k&gt;) such that v&lt;1&gt; is in D&lt;1&gt;, v&lt;2&gt; is in D&lt;2&gt;,
| and so on.  ...
|
| A 'relation' is any subset of the Cartesian product of
| one or more domains.  As far as databases are concerned,
| it is pointless to discuss infinite relations, so we shall
| assume that a relation is finite unless we state otherwise.  ...
|
| The members of a relation are called 'tuples'.  Each relation that
| is a subset of D&lt;1&gt; x D&lt;2&gt; x ... x D&lt;k&gt; is said to have 'arity' k.
| A tuple (v&lt;1&gt;, v&lt;2&gt;, ..., v&lt;k&gt;) has k 'components';  the i^th
| component is v&lt;i&gt;.  Often we use the shorthand v&lt;1&gt;v&lt;2&gt;...v&lt;k&gt;
| to denote the tuple (v&lt;1&gt;, v&lt;2&gt;, ..., v&lt;k&gt;).
|
| It helps to view a relation as a table, where each row
| is a tuple and each column corresponds to one component.
| The columns are often given names, called 'attributes'.
|
| Example 3.1.  In Figure 3.1 we see a relation whose attributes
| are CITY, STATE, and POP.  The arity of the relation is three.
| For example, (Miami, Oklahoma, 13880) is a tuple.
|
|     CITY    |   STATE   |    POP
| ¤~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~¤
|   San Diego | Texas     |    4490
|   Miami     | Oklahoma  |   13880
|   Pittsburg | Iowa      |     509
|
| Figure 3.1.  A Relation
|
| Jeffrey D. Ullman, 'Principles of Database Systems',
| Computer Science Press, Rockville, MD, 1980, pages 73-74.

MW:  So tell me is it San Diego or Texas
     that has a population of 4490?

Joke, right?

MW:  The issue is that whilst the formality may be as you describe, ...

Not my description.  This is a "standardly upstanding omnibus"
on the subject, though I did pick out the oldest edition that
I could find around the house in order to emphasize how long
these teachings have been being dinned into our data-brains.

Need I remind you that this particular exhibition of textbook-thumping
behavior was occasioned by your own remarks, as instanced in Exhibit B?

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~EXHIBIT~B~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  Why do you think anyone would want to say this?
     If you are going to take a simple KIF binary relation
     instance and represent it in a relational database, and
     you want to do some basic data management of that relation,
     you need several columns to do it.  You need 3 columns (plus
     the table name) as a minimum to have the equivalent expressive
     power in a single record to something like:

     (R x y)

MW:  Now in KIF when elsewhere you want to refer to (R x y)
     you just state it again there.  In a database you don't,
     you make a surrogate for the object that is represented,
     and use that.  So if KIF used a similar approach you would
     have something like:

     #1 (R x y)

MW:  Well you would need to be pretty dumb not to see
     that this is 4 elements you need to find a place for.
     Even with one of them being the table name you are left
     with 3 (minimum).

MW:  So to suggest that there is an equivalence
     between a binary relation and a table with
     2 columns is either ignorant or mischevous.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

I believe that I have sufficiently addressed the point for
which the above reference was adduced, to wit, that the
following statement is either ignorant or mischievous:

| MW:  So to suggest that there is an equivalence
|      between a binary relation and a table with
|      2 columns is either ignorant or mischevous.

MW:  ... practice is different.  In most databases I have seen,
     each record has a primary key, and each of the other columns
     are related to the binary key, so I'm guessing, but in the
     example above we have for the first record:

MW:  San Diego is in Texas (obviously not the one I know)
     San Diego has a population of 4490

MW:  So what is really represented here is two binary relations.
     They are just denormalised into a ternary relation.

There are so many things wrong with these three paragraphs
that I will have to address a whole separate note to them.
In the mean time I hope that you will do yourself the
favor of contemplating the following words of wisdom:

| MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
|      They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
|      infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
|      combinations of things, and then I see a further
|      infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
|      ourselves to those where all the members of the
|      set have the same adacity).

I'll be back.

Jon Awbrey
