&gt;In the ongoing dicussion between Pat and Ian,
&gt;I have decided to attempt to slice a tiny part of their issues and
&gt;see if we can start a separate thread on the issue of axioms for
&gt;granularity.

Great idea. However we ought to be aware that there are some people 
who have thought about this stuff quite hard already, including Jerry 
Hobbs and Nick Asher.

&gt;First, the discussion in progress.
&gt;
&gt;Ian Niles said:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  .... Generally speaking, when one distinguishes stuffs from objects,
&gt; &gt; &gt;one claims that the stuffs are stuff-like only at or above a certain level
&gt; &gt; &gt;of granularity, and, hence, parts of things at this level of granularity
&gt; &gt; &gt;will not be stuff-like.
&gt;
&gt;Pat Hayes replied:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; By the way, that idea of "down to a certain level of granularity" is
&gt; &gt; a fine aspiration for an ontologist, and everyone sees that we need
&gt; &gt; it, but nobody has actually managed to do it. I don't know of anyone
&gt; &gt; who has axiomatized the idea satisfactorily (yet). The nearest is
&gt; &gt; Jerry Hobbs, and he had to hack round the basic problem by assuming
&gt; &gt; that approximation is transitive (which of course it isnt, as every
&gt; &gt; engineer, builder and carpenter knows in detail.) Ive been trying to
&gt; &gt; do this, on and off, for about 30 years and I havnt managed it yet,
&gt; &gt; but I do have a very finely honed sense of how not to do it and why
&gt; &gt; all extant ideas don't work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The central problem is that the heap paradox has a very nasty
&gt; &gt; interaction with logical inference: it violates the transitivity of
&gt; &gt; correctness.  About every decade or so someone publishes a paper
&gt; &gt; about granularity or approximation which fails to solve the basic
&gt; &gt; problem.
&gt; &gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; &gt; You are relying on this notion of granularity to do a lot of your
&gt; &gt; work here. I would urge caution, since you will have a very hard time
&gt; &gt; cashing out this intellectual loan.
&gt;
&gt;the heap paradox, as i understand it, says something like:
&gt;
&gt;Assume you have a heap of sand, and start the process of removing
&gt;one grain of sand at a time from that heap.
&gt;
&gt;When you have a trillion grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
&gt;As the process continues, you have a smaller and smaller heap.
&gt;When you have a million grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
&gt;As the process continues, you have a smaller and smaller heap.
&gt;When you have a ten thousand grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
&gt;As the process continues, you have a smaller and smaller heap.
&gt;When you have a few hundred grains left, you still have a heap of sand.
&gt;Suddenly as the process continues, you don't have a heap left,
&gt;but just a a few grains.

Well yes, but you have missed out the part that makes it a paradox. 
Heres the key point: if you take away one grain of sand from a large 
pile then is still a large pile. (Because you can't even tell the 
difference; it is too small to matter; it is below the granularity 
level; it is within tolerance; etc.,; all ways of saying the same 
thing.). However, every pile, no matter how large, has some finite 
number of grains in it. Ergo, by mathematical induction, it is easy 
to prove (PROVE !) that even a pile with only one grain in it is a 
large pile. But a pile with one grain is not a large pile.

&gt;This paradox has a temporal analogue as well.

Yes, it can be given temporal, spatial and other analogs. Zenos 
paradoxes have the same flavor. Many of these have been resolved by 
talking about limits, but limits don't help for the heap paradox, 
since it arises using induction. (You could try denying induction, 
but it seems like a desperate measure.)

&gt;lets say you have a film of a man walking from New York to L.A.
&gt;(admittedly a very long film).  I am going to refer to the film
&gt;for clarity, but the actual process of walking is what I'm going
&gt;to say has heap-like aspects.
&gt;As you shorten the film from a trip to L.A. to a trip from the front
&gt;door to the first stop-light, the temporal heap-like aspects lessen.
&gt;eventually, you don't have a heap of walking, but just a few steps.
&gt;
&gt;Now it seems to me that this change from heap-ness to non-heapness
&gt;is very similar to the change from countable sets to finite sets.

I don't think so, myself. That change (from infinite to finite) is 
different in kind precisely because you can't get across the 
infinite--&gt;finite barrier using induction. There is no contradiction 
in saying that if you take one grain of sand from an infinitely large 
heap then it's still infinitely large. You can't conclude anything 
from that by induction. The heap paradox depends on the fact that 
heaps, no matter how large, are finite.

The 'small' version of the infinite/finite contrast is the 
finite/infinitesimal contrast.  A bunch of folks at PARC (Danny 
Bobrow was one of them) suggested the use of infinitesimals to handle 
granularity. That does block the paradox, but it has the other odd 
consequence that you can now prove that no matter how many grains of 
sand you remove, the heap will never change its size. There really is 
no way around it: either a single grain makes no difference (in which 
case no finite number makes any difference) or else it does (in which 
case, what is the difference that one grain makes?)

BTW, here are some of the ideas Ive met. Some are better than others.
0. Choose a threshhold size and stick to it. Works in the same sense 
that Lego is bricklaying.
1. Infinitesimals (one grain makes no difference. See above.)
2. Variable truthvalues (one grain makes (large-heap ?x) *very 
slightly* less true.)
3. Orders of magnitude (Jerry Hobbs' idea. Define predicates like 
'large' as being about relative orders of magnitude. Works OK as long 
as you keep away from the boundary cases.)
4. Relativity (Nick Asher, I think. Idea is to simply forbid 
predicates like 'large' and use only  binary relations 'larger-than', 
and understand 'large' to mean something like 'larger than average', 
ie is always understood as relative to some population of 'typical' 
heaps. Complicated, but otherwise similar to 3.)
5. Tolerances (say that two sizes are within tolerance if you can't 
tell the difference between them. Being within tolerance is symmetric 
and reflexive but probably not transitive. There is an entire 
mathematical theory of 'tolerance spaces' which we could utilize, but 
it colors the entire logic, since all predications have to be made 
relative to a tolerance.)

None of these is what I would call a really good solution, but the 
last three have a snowball's chance.

&gt;According to my understanding, it is impossible to say that
&gt;a set is finite using only First order predicate logic.

Strictly, what is impossible is to write a first-order sentence which 
is true only in precisely the finite models. A quibble.

&gt;So approaching this from that perspective would be ill-advised.
&gt;
&gt;However this issue seems to be related to limits too, so maybe
&gt;it will be necessary to meet it head-on.
&gt;
&gt;The change-over from heap-ness to non-heap-ness seems to be
&gt;related to 'size'. When the size of the heap gets within a
&gt;a few orders of magnitude of the size of the granules,
&gt;the change-over occurs.

Well, assuming that there is a change-over, maybe. But if you can 
prove that there couldnt be a change-over, there's not much point 
worrying about when this impossible thing happens.

&gt;So what seems to be necessary for the axioms
&gt;is a general idea of a heap of something,
&gt;a general idea of the size of the heap of something,
&gt;a general idea of the granule of something,
&gt;a general idea of the size of the granule of something,
&gt;a general idea of order of magnitude between sizes,
&gt;and the idea of adding a granule to a heap, or removing one.
&gt;
&gt;So what are the problems with this process of axiomizing?

The central problem is that it seems to be just plain true that 
adding or removing something below the granule size makes *no 
difference* to the large-scale predications. Really no difference at 
all. Taking one grain from a large pile is *always* going to leave a 
large pile. It's not that there is some critical size at which 
removing one grain of sand makes 'large' become false of the heap. If 
you assume there is, you can indeed handle the problem, with a lot of 
artifice. But that's obviously wrong. There is no such critical size 
where largeness ends: that is the point. (That is what is wrong with 
ideas 3 and 4, by the way. They both entail that there is some 
straw-breaks-camels-back boundary, even though it might be 
context-dependent in some devious way.)

I once had the idea of looking at subject areas where very small 
differences really do matter, such as tolerances in engineering. 
There is an entire economics of tolerances in engineering, where 
people pay large amounts of money just to buy precision. (Check out 
the notion of 'size blocks' for example.) What you find is that 
people have evolved quite intricate ways of dealing with this topic, 
and quite intricate concepts are involved: notions like 'critical 
tolerance' and 'degree of fit', distinctions between upper and lower 
error bounds, and notions of measurements being taken directly from a 
standard (rather than transferred by measurement, the point being 
that the act of measuring is itself small-error-prone, and small 
errors are liable to add up into larger ones.)
A key aspect of all this reasoning seems to be that it supports good 
engineering (and framing and carpentery) practice which has evolved 
to provide methods which are secure against transitive accumulation 
of errors. Applied to inference, this means that it is OK to conclude 
that A = B provided that B was checked directly against A, but not if 
it was concluded from A = C and C = B, since that involves two 
potentially error-producing measurements, in general. This is what I 
meant by tolerances being in conflict with the transitivity of 
inference correctness. This is a bit like nonmonotonic reasoning, but 
worse. It might be OK to infer B from A and to infer C from B, but 
not to infer C from A, even though C does not in any way contradict A 
or over-ride the inference of B from A; just because it isn't safe to 
make too many inferences without checking the size blocks.
