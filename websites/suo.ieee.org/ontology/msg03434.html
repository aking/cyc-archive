Inquiry Driven Systems

&quot;Inquiry&quot; is a word in common use for a process that resolves doubt
and creates knowledge.  Computers are involved in inquiry today, and
are likely to become more so as time goes on.  The aim of my research
is to improve the service that computers bring to inquiry.  I plan to
approach this task by analyzing the nature of inquiry processes, with
an eye to those elements that can be given a computational basis.

I am interested in the kinds of inquiries which human beings carry on
in all the varieties of learning and reasoning from everyday life to
scientific practice.  I would like to design software that people could
use to carry their inquiries further, higher, faster.  Needless to say,
this could be an important component of all intelligent software systems
in the future.  In any application where a knowledge base is maintained,
it will become more and more important to examine the processes that
deliver the putative knowledge.

Three questions immediately arise in the connection between
inquiry and computation.  As they reflect on the concept of
inquiry, they have to do with its integrity, effectiveness, and
complexity.  These questions ask whether all such processes dubbed
&quot;inquiry&quot; have anything essential in common, whether any useful parts
of them can be automated in practice, and just how deep is the takedown
needed to reach the level of routine steps.  The issues of effectiveness
and complexity will be discussed throughout the remainder of this text,
but the problem of integrity must be dealt with immediately, since doubts
about it may interfere with my ability to exercise this title to &quot;inquiry&quot;.

Thus, we must examine the integrity, or well-definedness, of the very idea of
inquiry, that is, &quot;inquiry&quot; as a general concept rather than a catch-all word.
Is the faculty of inquiry a principled capacity, leading to a disciplined form
of conduct, or is it only a disjointed collection of unrelated skills?  As it
is currently being carried out on computers today, inquiry includes everything
from database searches, through dynamic simulation and statistical reasoning,
to mathematical theorem proving.  Insofar as these tasks constitute specialized
efforts, each of them demands software that is tailored to its individual purpose.
Insofar as these different modes of investigation contribute to larger inquiries,
our present methods for coordinating their separate findings are mostly ad hoc
and still a matter of human skill.  Thus, we might question whether the very
name &quot;inquiry&quot; succeeds in referring to a coherent and independent process.

Do all the varieties of inquiry have something in common, a structure or
a function that defines the essence of inquiry itself?  I will say &quot;yes&quot;.
One advantage of this answer is that it brings the topic of inquiry within
human scope, and also within my capacity to research.  Without this, the
field of inquiry would be impossible for any one human being to survey,
because a person would have to cover the union of all the areas that
employ inquiry.  By grasping what is shared by all inquiries, I can
focus on the intersection of their generating principles.  Another
benefit of opting for this answer is that it promises a common
medium for inquiry, one in which the many disparate pieces of
our puzzling nature may be bound together in a unified whole.

When I look at other examples of instruments that people have used
to extend their capacities, I see that two questions must be faced.
First, what are the principles that enable human performance?  Second,
what are the principles that can be augmented by available technology?
I will refer to these two issues as the question of original principles
and the question of technical extensions, respectively.  Following this
model leads me to examine the human capacity for inquiry, asking which
of its principles can be reflected in the computational medium, and which
of its faculties can be sharpened in the process.  It is not likely that
everybody with the same interests and applications would answer these
questions the same way, but I will describe how I approach them, what
has resulted so far, and what directions I plan to explore next.

The focus of my work will narrow in three steps.  First, I intend
to concentrate on the design of intelligent software systems that
support inquiry.  Then, I will select mathematical systems theory
as an indispensable tool, both for the analysis of inquiry itself
and for the design of programs to support it.  Finally, I plan to
develop a theory of qualitative differential equations, implement
methods for their computation and their solution, then apply the
resulting body of techniques to two kinds of recalcitrant problems:
(1) those where an inquiry must begin with too little information
to justify quantitative methods, and (2) those where a complete
logical analysis is necessary to identify critical assumptions.

The stages of work just described will gradually lead me to introduce the
concept of an &quot;inquiry driven system&quot;.  In rough terms, this type of system
is designed to integrate the functions of data-driven adaptive systems and
rule-driven intelligent systems.  The idea is to have a system whose adaptive
transformations are determined, not by learning from observations alone nor by
reasoning from concepts alone, but by the interactions between these two sources
of knowledge.  A system that combines different contributions to its knowledge base,
much less the mixed modes of empirical and rational types of knowledge, will find
that its next problem lies in reconciling the mismatches between these sources.
Thus, we arrive at the concept of an adaptive knowledge-base whose changes over
time are driven by the differences that it encounters between what is observed
in data and what is predicted by laws.  This sounds, at the proper theoretical
distance, like an echo of the error-controlled cybernetic system, moreover, it
falls into line with classic descriptions of scientific inquiry.  Finally, this
suggests that good formulations of such &quot;differences of opinion&quot; might allow us
to find differential laws for the temporal evolution of inquiry processes.

There are several implications of my approach that I need to emphasize.
Many distractions can be avoided if we guide our approach by the two questions
raised above, of principles and extensions, and if we guard against confounding
what they ask with what they do not ask.  The issues that surround these points,
concerning the actual nature and the possible nurture of the capacity for inquiry,
will be taken up shortly.  But first I need to deal with a preliminary source of
confusion.  This arises from the two vocabularies, the language of the application
domain, which talks about higher order functions and intentions of software users,
and the language of the resource domain, which describes the primitive computational
elements to which software designers must try to reduce the problem.  We are forced
to use, or at least to mention, both of these terminologies in our effort to bridge
the gap between them, but each of these languages plays a different role in the work.

In studies of formal specifications the designations &quot;reduced language&quot;
and &quot;reducing language&quot; are often used to discuss the two roles that are
encountered here, that of the &quot;application&quot;, &quot;practice&quot;, or &quot;target&quot; domain,
on the one hand, and that of the &quot;base&quot;, &quot;method&quot;, or &quot;(re)source&quot; domain,
on the other.  I will be using all of these terms, with the following two
qualifications.

First, I must note a trivial caution.  Our sense of &quot;source&quot; and &quot;target&quot;
will often get switched depending on our direction of work.  Furthermore,
these words are reserved in category theory to refer to the domain and
the codomain of an &quot;arrow&quot;, that is, a function, a mapping, a morphism,
or a transformation.  This will limit their use in the above sense to
the more informal contexts.

Now, I must deal with a more substantive issue.  In attempting to automate
a fraction of such grand capacities as intelligence and inquiry, it is seldom
that we totally succeed in reducing one domain to the other.  The reduction
attempt will usually result in our saying something like this:  that we have
reduced the capacity A in the application domain to the sum of the capacity B
in our base domain plus some residue C of unanalyzed abilities that must be
called in from outside the basic set.  The residual abilities will then be
assigned to the human side of the interface, that is, attributed to the
conscious observation, common sense, or creative ingenuity of users and
programmers.  In the theory of recursive functions, we would say that A
is &quot;relatively computable&quot;, given an &quot;oracle&quot; for C.  For this reason,
I will often speak of &quot;relating&quot; a task to a method, rather than fully
&quot;reducing&quot; it.  A measure of initial success is often achieved when we
can relate or connect an application task to a basic method, long before
we can completely reduce one set of them to the other.  The catch will
always be whether the basic set of resources has already been implemented,
or is just being promised, and whether the residual ability has a lower
complexity than the original task, or is actually more difficult.

At this point I can return to the task of analyzing and extending
the capacity for inquiry.  In order to enhance a human capacity
it is first necessary to understand its process.

To extend a human capacity we need to know the critical functions that
support that ability, and this involves us in a theory of the practice
domain.  This means that most of the language describing the target
functions will come from sources outside the areas of systems theory
and software engineering.  The first thoughts that we take for our
specs will come from the common parlance that everyone uses to talk
about learning and reasoning, and the rest will come from the special
fields that study these abilities, from psychology, education, logic,
and the philosophy of science.  This particular hybrid of work easily
fits under the broad banner of artificial intelligence, yet I need to
repeat that my principal aim is not to build any kind of autonomous
intelligence, but simply to amplify our own capacity for inquiry.

There are many well-reasoned and well-respected paradigms
for the study of learning and reasoning, any one of which
I might have chosen as a blueprint for the architecture of
inquiry.  The model of inquiry that works best for me is one
with a solid standing in the philosophy of science and whose
origins are entwined with the very beginnings of symbolic logic.
Its practical applications to education and social issues have
been studied in depth, and aspects of it have received attention
in the AI literature (Refs 1-8).  This is the pragmatic model of
inquiry, formulated by C.S. Peirce from his lifelong investigations
of classical logic and experimental reasoning.  For my purposes, all
this certification means is that the model has survived many years of
hard-knocks testing, and is therefore a good candidate for further trial.
Since we are still near the beginning of efforts to computerize inquiry,
it is not necessary to prove that this is the best of all possible models. 
At this early stage, any good ideas would help.

My purpose in looking to the practical arena of inquiry
and to its associated literature is to extract a body of
tasks in real demand and to start with a stock of plausible
suggestions for ways to meet these requirements.  Some of
what we find depicted in current pictures of learning and
reasoning may turn out to be inconsistent or unrealizable
projections, beyond the scope of our present or possible
technology.  This is the very sort of thing that we should
be interested in finding out!  It is one of the benefits of
submitting theories to trial by computer that we obtain this
knowledge.  Of course, the fact that no one can presently
find a way to make a concept effectively computable does
not prove that it is unworkable, but it does place the
idea in a different class.

This should be enough to say about why we sometimes need to cite
the language and critically reflect on the concepts of other fields
in the process of doing work within the disciplines of systems theory
and software engineering.  To sum it up, it is not a question of entering
another field or absorbing its materials, but of finding a good standpoint
on our own grounds from which to tackle the problems that the outside world
presents.

Sorting out which procedures are effective in inquiry and finding out
which functions are feasible to implement is a job we can do better in
the hard light demanded by formalized programs.  But there is nothing
wrong in principle with a top-down approach, so long as we do come down.
I will follow the analogy of a recursive program that progresses down
steps to its base, stepwise refining the details of higher-level specs.
The best reinforcement for such a program is to maintain a parallel
effort that builds up competencies from fundamentals.

Once I have addressed the question of what are the principles
that enable human inquiry it brings me to the question of how
I would set out to improve the human capacity for inquiry by
computational means.

Within the field of AI there are many ways of simulating and supporting
learning and reasoning that would not involve me in systems theory proper,
that is, in reflecting on mathematically defined systems or in considering
the dynamic trajectories that automata trace out through abstract state spaces. 
However, I have chosen to take the system-theoretic route for several reasons,
which I will now discuss.

First, if we succeed in understanding intelligent inquiry in terms
of system-theoretic properties and processes, it equips this knowledge
with the greatest degree of transferability between comparable systems.
In short, it makes our knowledge robust, and not narrowly limited to
a particular instantiation of the target capacity.

Second, if we organize our thinking in terms of a coherent system or
an integral agent that carries out inquiries, it helps to manage the
complexity of the design problem by splitting it into discrete stages.
This strategy is especially useful in dealing with the recursive or the
reflexive quality that bedevils all such inquiries into inquiry itself.
This aspect of self-application in the problem is probably unavoidable,
due to the following facts.  Human beings are complex agents, and any
system likely to support significant inquiry is bound to surpass the
complexity of most systems we can fully analyze today.  Research into
complex systems is one of the jobs that will depend on intelligent
software tools to advance in the future.  For this we need programs
that can follow the drift of inquiry and perhaps even scout out
fruitful directions of exploration.  Programs to do this will
need to acquire a heuristic model of the inquiry process that
they are designed to assist.  And so it goes.  Programs for
inquiry will pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.

Taking as given the system-theoretic approach from now on,
I can focus and rephrase my question about the technical
enhancement of inquiry.  How can we put computational
foundations under the theoretical models of inquiry,
at least, the ones that we discover to be accessible?
In more detail, what is the depth and content of the
task analysis that we need to relate the higher order
functions of inquiry with the primitive elements given
in systems theory and software engineering?  Connecting
the requirements of a formal theory of inquiry with the
resources of mathematical systems theory has led me to
the concept of inquiry driven systems.

The concept of an inquiry driven system is intended to capture
the essential properties of a broad lass of intelligent systems,
and to highlight the crucial processes which support learning and
reasoning in natural and cultural systems.  The defining properties
of inquiry driven systems are iscussed in the next few paragraphs.
I then consider what is needed to supply these abstractions with
operational definitions, concentrating on the terms of mathematical
systems theory as a suitable foundation.  After this, I discuss my
plans to implement a software system that is designed to help analyze
the qualitative behavior of complex systems, inquiry driven systems
in particular.

An inquiry driven system has components of state, accessible to
the system itself, which characterize the norms of its experience.
The idea of a norm has two meanings, both of which are useful here.
In one sense, we have the descriptive regularities that are observed
in summaries of past experience.  These norms are assumed to govern the
expectable sequences of future states, as determined by natural laws.
In another sense, we have the prescriptive policies that are selected
with an eye to future experience.  These norms govern the intendable
goals of processes, as controlled by deliberate choices.  Collectively,
these components constitute the knowledge base or intellectual component
of the system.

An inquiry driven system, in the simplest cases worth talking about,
requires at least three different modalities of knowledge component,
referred to as &quot;expectations&quot;, &quot;intentions&quot;, and &quot;observations&quot; of
the system.  Each of these components has the status of a theory,
that is, a propositional code that the agent of the system carries
along and maintains with itself through all of its changes of state,
possibly updating it as the need arises in experience.  However, all
of these theories have reference to a common world, and they indicate
under their varying lights more or less overlapping regions in the
state space of the system, or in some derivative or extension of
the basic state space.

The inquiry process is driven by the nature, the degree, and the extent
of the differences that exist at any time among its operative theories,
for example, the differences among the expectations, the intentions, and
the observations of the inquiry agent or the relevant community of inquiry.
These discrepancies are evidenced by differences in the assemblies of models,
empirical or theoretical, that are held to satisfy the respective theories.
Normally, human beings experience a high level of disparity among these
theories as a dissatisfying situation, a condition of cognitive discord.
For people, the incongruity of cognitive elements is accompanied by an
unsettled affective state, in Peirce's phrase, the &quot;irritation of doubt&quot;.
A person in this situation is usually motivated to reduce the annoying
disturbance by some action, all of which activities we may classify
under the heading of inquiry processes.
