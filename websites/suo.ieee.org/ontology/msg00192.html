Pat --

I'd like to use your example below to raise an issue I've raised here
before.  The aircraft example is a good one to talk about interoperability
among applications, and ontology vs. applications.

It seems to me that there might be several different software applications
that might be concerned with the same aircraft over its lifetime.  One
would be at the manufacturer that would provide the design specifications
for that type of aircraft.  Another would track the assembly process of
that particular plane.  There might be an application that tracks sales and
delivery of aircraft.  There would a maintenance system at the airline that
owns the aircraft to record its state of repair and disrepair.  There will
also be a scheduling system that assigns the aircraft to specific routes on
specific days.  And there will be air traffic control and ground control
systems that will track its specific position en route.

It seems to me that each of these applications could benefit from
ontologies that provide the meaningful categories of concern within the
domain of interest (aircraft design and engineering, aircraft manufacture,
maintenance, air traffic, etc.).  Some of these ontologies would have
overlapping concerns.  The parts and assembly discussion that you provide
below would apply both to the manufacturing application and to the
maintenance application, although there would be differences as well, such
as the need to know about refurbishment, for instance.  Some domains would
be quite distinct, even though dealing with the same instances of aircraft.
For instance air traffic control would not be expected to have an extensive
ontology of parts, assemblies, and sub-assemblies.  The result of this is
that there would be issues of overlapping and consistency among the various
ontologies that help structure the various applications.  So, for instance,
it would be good if an air traffic control system and a ground control
system had some common structure in terms of the kinds of things to be
tracked, and the behavior of those things in relation to each other (albeit
one in two-dimensional space and the other in three-dimensional space).
And a shipping and delivery application would have a less granular sense of
urgency about space time than either of the two just mentioned.

Furthermore, the applications that deal with instances of aircraft,
instances of aircraft components, and specific air traffic routes would not
themselves be ontologies, would they?  So that when you say "time-dependent
slots (or axioms) on the specific instance of a part itself" you don't
really mean specific instances (with a part-number), but rather axioms
about expected time-dependent relationships among part types (with model
numbers, maybe) in an ontology that supports the application.  Right?  Or
do you not make a distinction between an application that deals with
instances and an ontology that sets up categories and relationships that
can be used by one or more instance-managing applications, for their
operation and interoperation?

Thanks for your thoughts.

Matthew --
   Thanks for the clarification:
&gt;
&gt; The port engine on a plane is an example of an object that
&gt; can have periods of non-existance. When one engine is
&gt; removed for maintenance, and replaced by another.
&gt; However, your description of Pat's intent is sufficiently
&gt; unconstrained to cover that case.
&gt;
   This is an important issue, and I will provide my
current thoughts on it.
   This phenomenon is not one I would represent as being
some form of intermittent "concrete_existence".  I would reserve
"concrete_existence" for individual objects.  A specification of the
parts for some artifact, or protoypical natural object, is a definition
of some class of objects, which a particular object in the real world
may or may not conform to.  To be consistent, I think such definitions
need to refer to prototypes or "complete" objects.  The individual
parts may be classified as "vital", "essential" "typical", "optional",
"disjoint-alternate", or "accessory" -- for example.  The assertions of
the "presence" or "absence" of some designed part of an artifact at
some particular time and place, whether it is connected as intended in
the design, and whether it is functional, are time-dependent assertions
about specific instances of objects that don't change the definition of
the complete artifact.   A particular artifact that can serve the role of
a part of a plane may or may not be designated as "belonging"
to some particular plane (e.g. while being repaired), which is
not the same as saying that it is "in-place" and "functional".  I would
view these latter three assertions as time-dependent slots (or axioms)
on the specific instance of a part itself.
   Assuming that some instance of an artifact such as a plane is
sufficiently intact to be termed a plane, even though incomplete, it
should have time-dependent attributes such as "complete", or
"functional".  If "incomplete" there will be some list of parts that
are "missing".  Whether an artifact can be pulled apart and
cease its "existence" and then be re-assembled and said
to exist again under the same instance-name is a convention that
depends on "identity criteria", which Guarino has labored much
to clarify.  If there is some single vital part (fuselage?)
which by convention defines whether some object exists or not,
regardless of the presence of other parts, then intermittent
existence should not occur; the "incomplete" artifact would exist
as soon as the vital part came into existence, and cease to exist
when that vital part ceased to exist (and recursively for the
"vital part").  Alternatively, existence could be said to begin only
when some artifact has achieved functionality at some time, and
subsequent existence might be defined as being existence of the
vital part.
