&gt; Subj:  Peirce's Work - Classification of the Sciences (fwd)
&gt; Date:  Fri, 3 Nov 2000 14:37:39 -0800 (PST)
&gt; From:  Mary Keeler &lt;mkeeler@u.washington.edu&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Okay, here it is!  See if you can tell why
&gt; I think this &quot;diagram&quot; helps so much?
&gt; 
&gt; ---------- Forwarded message ----------
&gt; Date: Tue, 8 Aug 2000 17:51:10 -0700 (PDT)
&gt; From: Mary Keeler &lt;mkeeler@u.washington.edu&gt;
&gt; To: port-l@iupui.edu
&gt; Subject: Peirce's Work - Classification of the Sciences
&gt; 
&gt; Peirce's classification scheme first divides inquiry into the Sciences of
&gt; Review and the Sciences of Discovery.  This reconstruction of part of his
&gt; classification is a slightly corrected and modified version of what will
&gt; appear in my ICCS paper this year.  I will be leaving for the ICCS
&gt; conference on Friday, but will send several more posts in the &quot;Peirce's
&gt; Work&quot; series, before I depart.  Will be visiting family and friends in
&gt; Germany, Paris, and London.  Do let me know if I will be near enough to
&gt; meet up with any PORTers during the next three weeks?  (Tony, will you be
&gt; in Paris, by chance?)  I will be meeting with Jaime Nubiola in Cambridge,
&gt; MA, on my return, and we will work on mirror-site issues.  Hope to see
&gt; many of you in Darmstadt!  --Mary
&gt; 
&gt; Bear in mind as you examine the following that Peirce said:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Modern science, with its microscopes and telescopes, with its chemistry
&gt; and electricity, and with its entirely new appliances of life, has put us
&gt; into quite another world; almost as much so as if it had transported our
&gt; race to another planet.  Some of the old beliefs have no application
&gt; except in extended senses, and in such extended senses they are sometimes
&gt; dubitable and subject to just criticism.  It is above all the normative
&gt; sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic) that men are in dire need of
&gt; having severely criticized, in their relation to the new world created by
&gt; science.  Unfortunately, this need is as unconscious as it is great.&quot; [MS
&gt; 291 (1905); CP 5.513]
&gt; 
&gt; ______________________________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; _The Structure of Philosophy in a Classification of the Sciences of Discovery_
&gt; represents philosophy as a positive science, in the sense of discovering what
&gt; really is true but limited to &quot;so much of truth as can be inferred from common
&gt; experience.&quot;  The special sciences are principally occupied with the accumulation
&gt; of new facts inferred from specific human and natural inquiries
&gt; [see CP: 1.183-238 (1903)].
&gt; 
&gt; I. Mathematics (&quot;the Conditional or Hypothetical Science, whose only aim
&gt; is to discover not how things actually are, but how they might be supposed
&gt; to be, if not in our universe, then in some other studies what is and what
&gt; is not logically possible, without making itself responsible for its
&gt; actual existence.&quot;) [CP, 5/40 (1903)]
&gt; 
&gt; II. Philosophy (&quot;in Three Branches: Phenomenology ascertains and studies
&gt; the kinds of elements universally present in the phenomenon; meaning by
&gt; &quot;the phenomenon,&quot; whatever is present at any time to the mind in any
&gt; way; Normative science distinguishes what ought to be from what ought not
&gt; to be, and makes many other divisions and arrangements subservient to its
&gt; primary dualistic distinction; Metaphysics seeks to give an account of the
&gt; universe of mind and matter.  Normative science rests largely on
&gt; phenomenology and on mathematics; Metaphysics on phenomenology and on
&gt; normative science.&quot;) [CP: 1.186 (1903)]
&gt; 
&gt;         A. Phenomenology (the science of experience [in terms of Category
&gt;         Theory: Firstness, Secondness, Thirdness]. Peirce says: &quot;The most
&gt;         fundamental fact about the number three is its generative potency.
&gt;         This is a great philosophical truth having its origin and
&gt;         rationale in mathematics. . . . I analyze experience, which is the
&gt;         cognitive resultant of our past lives, and find in it three
&gt;         elements.  I call them Categories. . . . I will so far follow
&gt;         Hegel as to call this science Phenomenology although I will not
&gt;         restrict it to the observation and analysis of experience but
&gt;         extend it to describing all the features that are common to
&gt;         whatever is experienced or might conceivably be experienced or
&gt;         become an object of study in any way direct or indirect.&quot;)
&gt;         [CP: 4.309 (1903), see also 2.84 (1902), 5.37 (1903)]
&gt;         
&gt;         B. The Normative Sciences (&quot;the science of the laws of conformity
&gt;         of things [as phenomena] to ends, that is, perhaps, to Truth,
&gt;         Right, and Beauty.&quot;) [CP: 5.121 (1903)]
&gt;                 
&gt;                 1. Esthetics (the science of ideals; considers those
&gt;                 things whose ends are to embody qualities of feeling) 
&gt; 
&gt;                 2.Ethics (the theory of self-controlled or deliberate
&gt;                 conduct; considers those things whose ends lie in action)
&gt; 
&gt;                 3. Logic (Formal Semiotic, or the science of
&gt;                 self-controlled or deliberate thought; considers those
&gt;                 things whose end is to represent something)
&gt;         
&gt;                         a. Philosophical Grammar (Speculative Grammar, or
&gt;                         the theory of meaning) 
&gt; 
&gt;                         b. Critical Logic (the theory of inference)
&gt;         
&gt;                                 i.   Abduction (logic of hypothesis)
&gt;                                 ii.  Induction (logic of sampling)
&gt;                                 iii. Deduction (formal logic)
&gt; 
&gt;                         c. Philosophical Rhetoric (Speculative Rhetoric,
&gt;                         i.e., theory of method) 
&gt; 
&gt;         C. Metaphysics (&quot;the science of Reality. Reality consists in
&gt;         regularity.  Real regularity is active law. Active law is
&gt;         efficient reasonableness, or in other words is truly reasonable
&gt;         reasonableness.  Reasonable reasonableness is Thirdness as
&gt;         Thirdness.&quot;) [CP: 5.121-129 (1903); see also V 6, B1 (Monist
&gt;         series of 1891)]
&gt; 
&gt;                 1. Ontology (general metaphysics)
&gt;                 2. Psychical metaphysics (religion)             
&gt;                 3. Physical Metaphysics or Cosmology (natural laws)
&gt; 
&gt; III. The Special Sciences: these are now represented by the various
&gt; disciplines in a college of arts and sciences, apart from philosophy and
&gt; mathematics.  Peirce divides these into what we now think of as the
&gt; humanities and human studies (including psychology and the social
&gt; sciences) and the natural sciences, which would correspond roughly to the
&gt; distinction between the Geisteswissenschaften and the Naturwissenschaften)
&gt; [based on Joseph Ransdell's reconstruction].
