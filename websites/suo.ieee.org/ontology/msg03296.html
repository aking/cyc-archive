HP = Howard Pattee
JA = Jon Awbrey
BR = Betrand Russell

ERROR SIG:

It is important to hash this out really thoroughly,
so I will break up BR's text into bite-size chunks.

JA, chunking BR:

| How shall we describe the logical form of a belief?
|
| I want to try to get an account of the way that a belief is made up.
| That is not an easy question at all.  You cannot make what I should
| call a map-in-space of a belief.  You can make a map of an atomic
| fact but not of a belief, for the simple reason that space-relations
| always are of the atomic sort or complications of the atomic sort.
| I will try to illustrate what I mean.
|
| The point is in connexion with there being two verbs in the judgment
| and with the fact that both verbs have got to occur as verbs, because
| if thing is a verb it cannot occur otherwise than as a verb.
|
| Suppose I take &quot;A believes that B loves C&quot;.  &quot;Othello believes that Desdemona loves Cassio.&quot;
| There you have a false belief.  You have this odd state of affairs that the verb &quot;loves&quot;
| occurs in that proposition and seems to occur as relating Desdemona to Cassio whereas
| in fact it does not do so, but yet it does occur as a verb, it does occur in the sort
| of way that a verb should do.
|
| I mean that when A believes that B loves C, you have to have a verb in the place where
| &quot;loves&quot; occurs.  You cannot put a substantive in its place.  Therefore it is clear that
| the subordinate verb (i.e., the verb other that believing) is functioning as a verb, and
| seems to be relating two terms, but as a matter of fact does not when a judgment happens
| to be false.  That is what constitutes the puzzle about the nature of belief.
|
| You will notice that whenever one gets to really close quarters
| with the theory of error one has the puzzle of how to deal with
| error without assuming the existence of the non-existent.
|
| I mean that every theory of error sooner or later wrecks itself by assuming
| the existence of the non-existent.  As when I say &quot;Desdemona loves Cassio&quot;,
| it seems as if you have a non-existent love between Desdemona and Cassio,
| but that is just as wrong as a non-existent unicorn.  So you have to
| explain the whole theory of judgment in some other way.  I come now
| to this question of a map.  Suppose you try such a map as this:
|
|                                    Othello
|                                       |
|                                       |
|                                   beli|eves
|                                       |
|                                       v
|                        Desdemona -----------&gt; Cassio
|                                     loves
|
| The question of making a map is not so strange as you might suppose
| because it is part of the whole theory of symbolism.  It is important
| to realize where and how a symbolism of that sort would be wrong:
|
| Where and how it is wrong is that in the symbol you have this relationship
| relating these two things and in the fact it doesn't really relate them.
|
| You cannot get in space any occurrence which is logically of the same form as belief.
|
| When I say &quot;logically of the same form&quot; I mean that one can be obtained
| from the other by replacing the constituents of the one by the new terms.
|
| If I say &quot;Desdemona loves Cassio&quot; that is of the same form as &quot;A is to the right of B&quot;.
|
| Those are of the same form, and I say that nothing
| that occurs in space is of the same form as belief.
|
| I have got on here to a new sort of thing, a new beast for our
| zoo, not another member of our former species but a new species.
|
| The discovery of this fact is due to Mr. Wittgenstein.

HP: I think Russell has just learned to distinguish syntax and semantics.

I do not wish to comment on that particular issue right now.  I read this to indicate
that BR has come up to the inextricably intertwined problems of &quot;intentional contexts&quot;
and &quot;propositional attitudes&quot;, and is about to run up against all of those refractory
resistances to analysis that Quine would one day adumbrate as &quot;referential opacities&quot;.
But the obscurity of the obstacle is relative to the &quot;form of analysis&quot; (FOA) that is
applied thereto, and it never seems to occur to a certain type of hard-headed thinker
that maybe the first essay at a method is not as all-fired universal as it might have
been one time cracked up to be.

Comically, all too comically, BR and LW have not gotten out much,
busy as teacher and student have been almost exclusively reading
each other's papers, and so, like children on their first visit
to the zoo, they appear to think that, between the two of them,
they have personally discovered all the beasts that live there.

Jon Awbrey
