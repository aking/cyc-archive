Doug,
   I think it would be both relevant and valuable to have someone create an 
ontology of teams and groups, hopefully consistent with the ontology that 
has been produced so far.  It would be interesting to see how this would 
fit into the mereological axioms Ian has integrated into the merged ontology.

&gt;This thread is one of several where I could make this point, but I like the

&gt;
&gt;It seems to me from an ontological perspective it is very interesting to
&gt;talk about the nature of teams, the various kinds of teams that we know of
&gt;(professional, university, informal children's teams chosen on a
&gt;playground, etc.), how the various kinds of teams differ from one another,
&gt;and how they each differ from other forms of human social systems.
&gt;Additionally, how human social systems differ from other natural social
&gt;systems (ant colonies, schools of fish, cooperating beavers, etc.), and how
&gt;living social systems differ and are similar to other living systems, such
&gt;as organisms (humans, whales, worms), systemic parts of organisms
&gt;(cardiovascular systems, digestive systems etc.), cells, robots, cars,
&gt;telecommunication networks, the whirlpool in my bathtub and the Great Red
&gt;Spot of Jupiter.  In other words ontological consideration of systems,
&gt;whether autopoietic or not, complex and adaptive or not, dissipative
&gt;structures or not, legally constituted or not, and any of many interesting
&gt;dimensions of this subject.
&gt;
&gt;Is it too soon to start carving up the work of the SUO along these lines?
&gt;Or is this ever going to be the focus of this work?  At some level it is
&gt;probably important to have exhaustive discussions of how set theory and 4-d
&gt;vs. 3-d+time would accommodate meaningful classifications.  It certainly
&gt;must be interesting, since we keep gravitating back to these discussions.
&gt;
&gt;I could have easily jumped into the long discussion of relationships vs.
&gt;relations.  What I would have said there is that there is that while the
&gt;various technical meanings of these terms is interesting, it should be
&gt;equally interesting, from an ontological point of view, that there are
&gt;large numbers of interesting types of relationships (contractual, proximity
&gt;emotional, linguistic, assembly, etc., etc.)  Isn't this what we're about
&gt;in this work?  Or is it still just too early to start?

&gt;Pat, Matthew, et al,
&gt;
&gt;I am following Pat's suggestion and only replying to the mailing list. (I
&gt;am
&gt;in two minds about whether I would actually like to be replied to directly
&gt;on topics I have contributed to - as sifting through the SUO mailing list
&gt;takes time - and I sometimes miss interesting messages - but I also
&gt;understand Pat's point of view).
&gt;
&gt;I have merged (or is it aligned) messages from Pat and Matthew on similar
&gt;topics.
&gt;I've also taken the liberty of changing the title - hopefully making it
&gt;more
&gt;meaningful.

&gt;Dear Chris,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; You also wrote:
&gt; &gt; Notice it only arises for entities that are located in space
&gt; &gt; and time: abstract things like sets and numbers are not classified in
&gt; &gt; either of these ways. (Note in particular that a set of physical
&gt; &gt; things is not itself physical.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are you taking physical and abstract as two sides of the same
&gt; &gt; distinction
&gt; &gt; here - or are there more types. It also seems to me that the complete
&gt; &gt; banning of spatio-temporal location for sets can be
&gt; &gt; problematic if you want
&gt; &gt; to think of things such as groups (football teams, and so on)
&gt; &gt; as sets. Some
&gt; &gt; people have suggested this - and ordinary language (for what
&gt; &gt; it is worth) at
&gt; &gt; least supports the view that they have a location ("the
&gt; &gt; English football
&gt; &gt; team was in Hungary last week"). So treating sets as abstract
&gt; &gt; seems to me a
&gt; &gt; choice which blocks off the possibility of treating 'physical
&gt; &gt; groups' as
&gt; &gt; sets.
&gt;
&gt;MW: Well I certainly don't see the England Football team as a set. I would
&gt;see them as a non contiguous aggregate. So I would have no trouble talking
&gt;about the total weight of the team (as I have said elsewhere - how much
&gt;does
&gt;a class weigh?).
&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;CP: The issue here is not about how to deal with a particular item, but how
&gt;the item influences the overall architecture. We have a notion of member
&gt;(of
&gt;a set), which is not transitive. Where we (well, some people) would like to
&gt;somehow say the set of physical things is not itself a physical things. We
&gt;also have a notion of part, which is transitive. Where we would like to say
&gt;a whole composed of physical parts is itself physical. We have the notion
&gt;of
&gt;a member of a group (collection, or whatever), which has characteristics of
&gt;both. Note: we use member of and part of for group - and I am not sure
&gt;quite
&gt;where the differences lie (and I would be interested in finding out). It
&gt;seems we now have three options:
&gt;1. Treat groups as sets. This recognizes that 'member of group' is not
&gt;transitive. But we need to drop the intuition that sets are absolutely
&gt;non-located (a difficult intuition to justify for small finite sets). (See
&gt;Max Blacks' "The elusiveness of sets" - The review of Metaphysics, 24, pp.
&gt;614-36, 1971 - for one description of this position.)
&gt;2. Treat groups as wholes - then we need a version of part of that is not
&gt;transitive. I may be part of the football team, but my hand certainly is
&gt;not.
&gt;3. Treat member/part of group as a new kind of relation - and groups etc.
&gt;as
&gt;a new category of things. This is unattractive for reasons of ontological
&gt;economy (if you like parsimony).
&gt;Matthew chose option 2. But I am not aware of a sufficiently fine
&gt;distinction here between different kinds of parts. The members of a
&gt;football
&gt;team seem to be privileged parts in a way in which the parts of a car are
&gt;not. We tend to think of sets having members with a common characteristic,
&gt;this is true of collections. We tend to think of a wholes' parts as having
&gt;different characteristics, the car's engine and bodywork are different
&gt;kinds
&gt;of things. More importantly the part relation is transitive, but part of
&gt;collection seems not to be. My hand is not a member of the football team in
&gt;a way in which I am.
&gt;For the record, I am attracted to using either 1 or 2 as the situation
&gt;demands it - both seem to me to be useful, and used. 3 seems unattractive
&gt;to
&gt;me because it seems to buy you some local simplicity at the cost a
&gt;significantly increasing global complexity. E.g. are collections of
&gt;collections the same type of thing as collections of physical objects - or
&gt;do we have a hierarchy of collections. Is the member of group transitive or
&gt;not? (Probably not - but we need to spell this out.)
&gt;It seems to me that spatio-temporal location (or weight) can easily be
&gt;'defined' for sets, but make more sense for sets that tend to have a
&gt;coherent spatio-temporal location - up to a certain granularity (as they
&gt;are
&gt;disconnected). We can say the football team is in London (now) or even in
&gt;this room (now) - depending on how far they are spread out. For sets such
&gt;as
&gt;the human race, we might say they are on the planet Earth now, but this
&gt;seems less satisfactory. We can see a similar issue arising for
&gt;disconnected
&gt;spread out physical objects. If we take masses (as Quine did) as the fusion
&gt;(sum) of all the stuff involved - milk as the fusion of all the bits of
&gt;milk
&gt;that there are, have been or will be. Then this is a physical object,
&gt;however it has a uninteresting, useless location and weight (particularly
&gt;if
&gt;we take it as extended over possible worlds). This seems to me to show that
&gt;the issue about spatio-temporal location (and weight) is more linked to
&gt;usefulness and ease of determination, rather than the nature of the things
&gt;itself.

&gt;There is a pretty well-investigated subject area of formalisations of
&gt;the notion of 'part', called mereology. It seems clear that the
&gt;set/subset relation and the whole/part relation are intriguingly
&gt;similar in some ways, but also pretty clearly not the same relation,
&gt;no matter what David Lewis thinks. At any rate, one would need to
&gt;make a very strong case to say they were. If you substitute a team
&gt;member, the team has a *different* set of players, yes? If you want
&gt;to say no, then how are you going to talk about what I would call the
&gt;set of players in the team?
&gt;CP: In the case of a configured group, which a football team can be
&gt;interpreted as, we have the positions, which give the team its structure.
&gt;Then substituting a team member, is just changing the person who plays in a
&gt;position. There is the same set - in the sense of the same configutation,
&gt;it
&gt;is just that one of the positions - a space-time worm - has different
&gt;people
&gt;occupying different stages at different times. So in a perdurantist
&gt;world-view we can explain what you mean by a different set of players. The
&gt;situation bets more complex when the team's configuration changes over
&gt;time - e.g. you go from a 3-4-3 structure to a 4-4-2 structure say (I am
&gt;not
&gt;a fan of football so these may not be common structures).

&gt;a
&gt; &gt;choice which blocks off the possibility of treating 'physical groups' as
&gt; &gt;sets.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, and I would indeed block that one, and insist that any axiomatic
&gt;ontology make a sharp distinction between a physical group or
&gt;collection (such as a team, a shoal or a flock) and a set. If you do
&gt;not do this, then for example set-membership will need to have a
&gt;temporal parameter. Good luck with adapting ZF (or any other known
&gt;set theory) to include temporal reasoning. (And what else is down
&gt;that road? Situations? points of view?)
&gt;CP: Pat, does this mean you take option 3 above?
&gt;
&gt;Ordinary language is a lousy guide to ontological coherence, as I've
&gt;said before. If the idea of 'set' were clear in NL, then people like
&gt;Russell and Whitehead would have had a much easier time.
&gt;
&gt;CP: I agree about ordinary language. But I think you are being a bit too
&gt;quick about temporalising. The 'problem' that you are referring to is the
&gt;standard endurantist problem for 'properties' that change. And you are only
&gt;forced to temporalise if you are an endurantist. A perdurantist can use
&gt;exactly the same strategy for dealing with the property 'being a member of
&gt;group X' as with 'being red'. If one uses temporal stages, then there is no
&gt;need for temporalisation. So the issue about temporalising is the old
&gt;endurantist-perdurantist choice -  which, as one would guess, raises its
&gt;head in the notion of collections.
&gt; &gt;In the spirit of starting middle out (with rich middle-level concepts) -
&gt;it
&gt; &gt;may make sense to defer any decision of abstractness and sets until we
&gt;have
&gt; &gt;some more material to work on.
&gt;
&gt;Well, if there is one topic in the world that might be said to have
&gt;been formalized to death, it is surely set theory. You think the jury
&gt;is still out? (And you think we are going to do better than Russell,
&gt;Zermelo, Quine, Von Neumann, etc. ?)
