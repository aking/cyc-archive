Arisbeans, SUOphists, Countre Kin,

It would be so much easier if we knew who to blame,
if only we could name names and pin the tale on some
ass from the past, like Homer, Sophocles, Euripides,
Parmenides, Heraclitus, that whole pack of Sophists,
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Ovid, Augustine, Aquinas,
Ockham, Scotus, Descartes, Leibniz, Locke, Hume, Kant,
Frege, Peirce, Russell, Wittgenstein, Carnap, the list
of usual suspects goes on and on, until one has clean
forgotten almost entirely what the original sin might
have been, in the first place.

But now I must try to focus, and strain to remember why
I threaded this thread, in the first place, so long ago,
in so many ways before there was even the most gossamer
gleam of a web in even the most peircing needler's eye.

For quite some time now my main concern has been to pry
the last fingers of the Cartesian mortemain from around
the neck of Peirce's philosophy, but I have discovered
to my profound dismay that this fatal stranglehold has
a much tighter grip on all of our thinking than might
have been guessed from the frequency and the tone of
our common protestations against it.  But methinks
that we protest too much, and practice too little,
when it comes to the sowing and the weeding and
the reaping of these bright and shiny new beans,
the ones that the Stranger named Peirce sold us.

Now, you may think that I have just pinned it all on poor Descartes,
but I am careful, as a general rule, to distinguish the derivative
tradition, as it comes to be received, from the integral person,
as he or she really was, and even as he or she actually wrote.

I had planned to take up the case of "The Sophist versus Plato's 'Sophist'"
at about this point, but I have recently discovered that my reading of this
source is far more controversial than ever I would have dreamed, given that
I have always thought that it was a fairly standard reading, if not always
a universally favored one, and so there is little that I can do in a case
like this but to return to my sources, read them over one more time, and
see if I do not see something different in them than I did in the last 
millennium.  But that will have to be the exercise of another time.

In my own defense, I can only say that this reading was by no means
original with me, but one that I was led into by a former generation
of teachers that I had.  Did my teachers mislead me?  This is always
a fair question, of course, and so it is one that I will examine in
the days and the weeks, if not the months and the years, to come.

And Still Pre-Ambling,
After All These Years,

Jon Awbrey
