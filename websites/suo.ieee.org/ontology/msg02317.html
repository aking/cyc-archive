Matthew,

My previous reply on this thread was made while
I was earnestly being called to dinner, and my
rush to finish up what was still on this plate
may have led to a bit of inadvertent sloppiness
in the resulting message.  Consequently, I have
spliced in a few corrections, refinements, and
additional remarks below.

&gt; &gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am still looking for easy ways to explain what's wrong with
&gt; &gt; &gt; this purported "analysis", "definition", "transliteration", or
&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever.  The reason why it is important no longer has anything
&gt; &gt; &gt; to do with triadicity specifically, but now has to do with whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; posterity will judge the SUO group as having understood even so much
&gt; &gt; &gt; as what a relation or a tuple is.  At the present time that question
&gt; &gt; &gt; is seriously in doubt.  Yes, of course, people are able to recite
&gt; &gt; &gt; the phrase that "a relation is a set of tuples", but whether they
&gt; &gt; &gt; can follow up any significant number of the consequences of that
&gt; &gt; &gt; token tenet, and whether they can recognize a tuple in many of
&gt; &gt; &gt; its sundry disguises, those are different questions altogether.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, while I was pondering, weak and weary, this whole problematic
&gt; &gt; &gt; scene, I happened to recall a sort of a pedagogical moment from my own
&gt; &gt; &gt; education that I thought might serve as a generic brand of anecdote,
&gt; &gt; &gt; bringing perhaps a little bit of illumination on the present case.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the subject of Real Analysis, one is concerned
&gt; &gt; &gt; with spaces and functions of the following types:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; &gt; |  Dimension    |  Space        |  Function     |
&gt; &gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; &gt; |  1            |  R^1 = R      |  R^1 -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; &gt; |  2            |  R^2 = RxR    |  R^2 -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; &gt; |  3            |  R^3 = RxRxR  |  R^3 -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; &gt; |  ...          |  ...          |  ...          |
&gt; &gt; &gt; |  n            |  R^n          |  R^n -&gt; R     |
&gt; &gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, it is typical to begin with the one-dimensional case
&gt; &gt; &gt; and gradually to work toward the multi-dimensional setting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In referring to the elements of R and mappings from R to R,
&gt; &gt; &gt; one naturally uses notations like "x in R",  "f : R -&gt; R",
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the value of f at x is written "f(x)".  So far, so good.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; When one finally arrives at the n-dimensional case, it is
&gt; &gt; &gt; usual to write things like "x = &lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;&gt;", using
&gt; &gt; &gt; either the single letter or the coordinate list, depending
&gt; &gt; &gt; on whichever is convenient at a given moment of discussion.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But how do you write the value of f at x?  Strictly speaking,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is, according to the rulebook of syntactic substitution,
&gt; &gt; &gt; one ought to write either "f(x)" or "f(&lt;x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;&gt;)",
&gt; &gt; &gt; and when you go through this ringer for the first time, some
&gt; &gt; &gt; professors will actually insist that you preserve this purity
&gt; &gt; &gt; of notational discipline, sanctioning "f(x&lt;1&gt;, ..., x&lt;n&gt;)" as
&gt; &gt; &gt; a vile abuse of notation.  Of course, this degree of pickiness
&gt; &gt; &gt; will all seem a bit silly, at first and then again a few months
&gt; &gt; &gt; later when you have much worse problems to worry about, but still,
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience teaches the experienced teacher that there is a point
&gt; &gt; &gt; to it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Moral Of The Story?  Well, one thing ought to be perfectly clear
&gt; &gt; &gt; by now to all sensible observers, and that is that the nature and
&gt; &gt; &gt; the structure of the mathematical object in question, whether it
&gt; &gt; &gt; is x in R^n or else f : R^n -&gt; R, is not affected one liitle bit
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the syntactic expression, whatever its structure, that is used
&gt; &gt; &gt; to refer to it.  And if anybody thinks to make ontological capital
&gt; &gt; &gt; off the abuse of notation, or the poetic license, that permits us
&gt; &gt; &gt; to write "f(x, y, z)" instead of "f(&lt;x, y, z&gt;)", or vice versa,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then that person has another think coming.  The arity of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; relation is the same either way.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  I agree that if you have some set of binary relations
&gt; &gt;     that essentially define the coordinate positions of
&gt; &gt;     components in some higher arity relation then there
&gt; &gt;     is also the higher arity relation.
&gt; 
&gt; You are saying here that the definition of a k-tuple
&gt; in terms of its k coordinate projections has nothing
&gt; to do with the potential analysis, decomposition, or
&gt; whatever, of the whole k-adic relation into possibly
&gt; simpler relations, arity-wise.   Welcome to the club!
&gt; 
&gt; So this conception of cartesian product space, which
&gt; was not discovered by Quine fifty years ago, but has
&gt; made up a staple article of furniture in mathematics,
&gt; since, here's a hint, Descartes, has been an utterly
&gt; irrelevant red herring since the initial moment that
&gt; it first got foisted on the scene.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That was not the issue.  Indeed, the axiom that Chris M
&gt; &gt; has put together on my behalf specifically states this.
&gt; &gt; The issue was whether the higher arity relation could be
&gt; &gt; represented by some set of binary relations.  You do not
&gt; &gt; seem to be disputing that this can be done in the manner
&gt; &gt; I have described.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, you, with a little bit -- okay, a lot! -- of non-help
&gt; from others, are consistently failing to distinguish between
&gt; a relation, which is, as you say, a set, and a single tuple.

This has become such a general issue and such a constant source
of misunderstanding in our joint and several efforts to explore
the logic of relations that I am going to extract it for a bit
of focal attention back on the mainline of the "Exposition".

This basic point here is that there are two levels of description:

1.  The level having to do with relations,
    which are sets of tuples.

2.  The level having to do with ordered tuples,
    which can be seen as lists or as sequences,
    which are actually functions from an ordered
    set, like counting numbers, to a component set.

To describe a relation is to describe a set.
To describe a relation as a set it is necessary
to refer to either one of two sorts of things:

a.  Properties of relations, which are properties of sets.
    Here one is choosing to "change horses mid-stream"
    and to continue the res on the intensional ponens.

b.  Categories, classes, or sets of relations, which are
    categories, classes, or sets of sets.  Here one is
    choosing to "stay the course" and to keep betting
    on the horse of the initial extensional color.

To describe a relation as a set of tuples it is, of course,
necessary to describe the tuples to some degree and extent,
perhaps even to remind oneself of their structure as tuples,
according to some definitions of the cartesian product, say,
the ones that express it in terms of projections or of roles.
But I said "necessary" not "sufficient".  There is much more
to the structure of a relation, qua set, than the structure
of its tuples, taken severally, one at a time, in isolation.

&gt; The coordinate projections are relevant to the structure of
&gt; a single k-tuple.  To talk about analyzing a whole relation
&gt; in terms of other entire relations, putatively simpler ones,
&gt; one needs to bring in operations that operate on whole sets.
&gt; Examples of 2-adic set operations (so 3-adic set relations)
&gt; are things like Intersection, Union, Relational Composition.
&gt; Examples of 1-adic set operations (so 2-adic set relations)
&gt; are things like Complementation and the various Projections.
&gt; To do anything that qualifies as an "analysis" (up-chunking)
&gt; of a set, one would have to use "forms of analysis" that are
&gt; at least as adic as 2-adic set operations (3-adic relations).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Indeed your argument now seems to be that it says the
&gt; &gt; same thing (of course it should say the same thing).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  I understood that a part of your argument was that n-adic
&gt; &gt;     relations could ALWAYS be "decomposed" into triadic relations,
&gt; &gt;     but not necessarily to binary relations.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that is correct.  But people are responsible only for what
&gt; they actually say.  And the way that I and my whole army uses
&gt; the terms "composition" and "decomposition" is criterial to
&gt; the claim being made.  It is only that a set of folks who
&gt; have never bothered to read or to understand the initial
&gt; statement of the issue have cluttered up the beach with
&gt; their peculiar variety of cargo-cultism.

Let me state this more carefully.

1.  Speaking purely of "compositive reduction",
    all k-adic relations can be "reduced to
    "compositions" of 3-adic relations, whereas
    no 3-adic relations can be "reduced to
    "compositions" of 2-adic relations.

2.  Speaking purely of "projective reduction",
    the situation is more mixed, but one must
    note that this form of reduction takes it
    for granted that one can use a well-known
    set of 3-adic relations, the connectives,
    in order to perform the reduction at all.

3.  The "change of variables" formula:
    For all x in X,  L(x) &lt;=&gt; [L(y) for some y in X] --
    the introduction of "y = x" is just another distraction --
    is a true thing to say about the application of a relation L
    to a tuple x in a cartesian product space X, but it contributes
    nothing non-trivial to the articulation of L as a relation, per se.

&gt; &gt; However, following the argument you seem to be putting forward here,
&gt; &gt; if I have a 4-adic, or 5-adic relation, then "decomposing" it does
&gt; &gt; not put it out of existence, it only means that it is implied rather
&gt; &gt; than explicit in some ontology.

I did not understand this piece about putting relations "out of existence".
In any case, it appears that you are using "relation" to mean "tuple" here.

&gt; This one tuple at a time investigation has nothing
&gt; to do with the matter of analyzing whole relations.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This seems to be arguing both ends against the middle to me.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I'm afraid you guys have been shadow-boxing in the dark,
&gt; and nobody even rang the bell.
