&gt; &gt; &gt; So perceptions about what is "relevant" and what is not, what

&gt; &gt; &gt; personal opinions derived from personal or corporate interests,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and unless people are prepared to argue and to give reasons why
&gt; &gt; &gt; this or that potential contribution is "on" or "off" topic, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; I personally have to regard such aspersions as the abuse of true
&gt; &gt; &gt; collegiality that they really are.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Perhaps Jon can explain the relevance of his postings which seem
&gt; &gt; quite frivolous, such as information about Donald Duck's nephews,
&gt; &gt; a myth about how the "trickster-god" achieved his manhood, items
&gt; &gt; of poetry, etc.  To me, they just seem to be "spam".
&gt; 
&gt; [Beginning of "my two cents" worth ...]
&gt; 
&gt; I'd say that the problem, from my perspective, is that the wording
&gt; of Jon's postings (including the original posting you reference above)
&gt; are unnecessarily complex.  Even though I am a native English speaker,
&gt; I have a much much harder time reading and understanding Jon's postings
&gt; than anyone else's postings (see postings recently from Adam, Jim, John,
&gt; Matthew, Nicolas, Phil, etc.).  In my opinion, Jon seems to care more
&gt; about getting the characters to line up in some pattern (if your E-mail
&gt; displays in, say, Courier font then you know what I'm talking about)
&gt; than getting the message across.
&gt; 
&gt; Recommendation:  Higher priority should be given to being clear and concise ...
&gt; it helps for native and non-native English speakers.
&gt; 
&gt; In my experience in E-mail and netnews distribution over the past 20+ years,
&gt; the technology doesn't matter as much as the willingness of the communities
&gt; to be "self-policing".  Even better would be self-discipline ...
&gt; self-policing wouldn't be necessary.  Occassional face-to-face
&gt; meetings help, too: they build they bonds for self-discipline,
&gt; self-policing, and common goals ... we have discussed this,
&gt; I know face-to-face meetings are difficult.  Regardless of
&gt; the technology, "bad" participants can drag down the joint
&gt; efforts, e.g., meetings, E-mail, lists, papers.
&gt; 
&gt; Recommendation:  Determine the policy before choosing
&gt; a distribution technology.  Simply put, if you haven't
&gt; determined how you will handle those who violate the rules,
&gt; then the technology doesn't really matter.  I think some people
&gt; believe that those "bad" participants will simply have their own
&gt; topics and any good technology should be able to select the "good"
&gt; from the "bad".  It isn't that simple.  I've subscribed to "slashdot"
&gt; for about 1.5 years, but there is *tons* of garbage in there ... it is
&gt; very difficult to keep up with "slashdot".  Back to the policy issue:
&gt; it would be terrible if this list became a "moderated" list (whether
&gt; it is E-mail, netnews, hypermail, slashcode, etc.), but that is what
&gt; it might become if we (collectively) don't have self-discipline.

Frank,

There are several different disciplines that I observe
in addition to my orthographic obsessions, which appear
to fascinate some folks to the point that they cannot
seem to focus on anything else.

1.  There is the discipline of inquiry, which means among other things:

    a.  The recognition of the problems that exist in a field.

    b.  The acknowledgement of the uncertainties that prevail.

    c.  The seeking out of whatever ideas might contribute to
        a practical solution, no matter what their sources.

    d.  The testing of potential solutions against the original
        problem requirements and against likely alternatives.

    e.  The checking of theoretical fancy against concrete examples,
        and against empirical datasets whenever pertinent and possible.

2.  There is the discipline if proof with respect to
    formal, logical, and mathematical assertions.

3.  There is the discipline of programming, and always keeping in
    mind what it takes to be making sense, computationally speaking.

4.  There is the discipline of reading the associated literature,
    or at least having read the basic primers in a relevant field,
    before weighing in with some axiom set hatched out on a rainy
    afternoon that is intended to "cover the globe" in some area.

5.  There is the discipline of providing scholarly references to
    the sources of the most significant ideas that I am aware of
    borrowing.  This is not just a matter of giving credit where
    credit is due, but is intended as a service to readers, so that
    they can avail themselves of the greater wealth of ideas that the
    original source is likely to provide, and so that they can check
    for themselves whether my interpretation of the source accords
    with the one that they would form from their own reading of it.
    For some odd reason, this has brought the charge of evangelism
    down on my head, but if the likes of Russell, Whitehead, and the
    whole analytic gang had observed a similar discipline, instead of
    treating the works of all previous generations as so much public
    domain material, then this charge would not even be in the air.

In pursuit of the principles, I have contributed to this group
some of the only detailed proofs of any assertions at all, and
one of the only real-life datasets gathered for funded research
that it has seen here.  This does not count, of course, links
to websites that may contain such things.  But some people
just seem to fixate on the passing bits of doggerel verse,
designed as a moment's comic relief.  Frankly, I do not
comprehend their taste.

Jon Awbrey
