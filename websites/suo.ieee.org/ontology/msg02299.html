Filament 2.  Method Of Reduction?

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Matthew,

I have gathered together on the present line the segments
of our discussion that surround your presentation of your
purported method of reduction.

JA:  As an object example, taken for the moment in
     the converse direction of synthesis, joining
     an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already
     an element of a 3-adic relation, just as every
     other "binary operation" is a 3-adic relation.

MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.
     Binary operations are of the form F : a -&gt; b,
     and even though a and b might be quite complex,
     the essential form is binary.

JA:  I would say that the accidental form, even the 
     superficial form is binary -- anything at all
     can be glossed over with a superficially simple
     appearance -- it is our job precisely to detect
     and to reveal the underlying complexities.

MW:  Interesting.  I prefer to reveal the underlying simplicity.

If there is an underlying simplicity, fine and dandy, but
merely fixating on a single elementary relation (or tuple)
at a time and ignoring the actual structure of a complex
system is an Rx for misunderstanding the real situation.
This is the rut that this discussion has been in ever
since Pat introjected that change of variables formula,
and all of the seeming development that has seemed to
occur has yet to alter what it basically says, to wit:

| For all x in some cartesian product space X,
| the following two statements are equivalent:
|
| 1.  R(x)
|
| 2.  R(y) for some y in X such that y = x.

This is true enough, and I can say quite ingenuously
that I envy the rank order of banality that is quite
admirably accomplished in it, but it contributes not
a whit to the anatomy of any relation of any valence.

JA:  The chief thing that is confusing the issue
     is the fact that x is written as a tuple on
     the left whereas the tuplehoods of x and y
     are unpacked via coordinate projections on
     the right side of the translitteration.

JA:  But this buzzines is all taking place local to each tuple,
     one tuple at a time, in a kind of serial monotony, and it
     does nothing to address, to analyze, or to articulate the
     global structure of any given relation.

The tuple-local arguments that you are propounding are
quite analogous to somebody saying something like this:

| At every point of the globe, the globe is locally flat,
| ergo et ipso flatso, the globe is proven globally flat.

There can be global properties of spaces that do not reduce
to the properties that are manifest in local approximations.

JA:  Here, let me try to explain it to you this way.
     The following table presents the 3-adic relation
     that is otherwise known as the 2-ary operation of
     conjunction, commonly symbolized by "and" or "&amp;":

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  Now, let us suppose that you are a humble Data Scrivener,
     as I once was, and your not-so-humble Boss comes to your
     cubicle one day, no doubt pursuant to that data downsize
     directive that I encouraged you to explore in a previous
     scenario, and tells you that you need to get this simple
     structure into a 2-column table at most, which being the
     true believer in economy that you are you promptly do as
     follows:

o-----------o---------o
|&lt; x  ,  y &gt;| z = x&amp;y |
o-----------o---------o
|&lt; 0  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 0  ,  1 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  1 &gt;|    1    |
o-----------o---------o

JA:  Whereupon you are promptly rewarded with a well-deserved
     promotion at twice your former salary for the incredible
     shrinking cost you have thereby beneficed your unit with!
     In yer dreams ...

JA:  The point of this example is that
     there is an information-theoretic
     reality that we are up against,
     the inherent dimensionality of
     a particular data set, and it
     cannot be wisked away through
     the prestidigitation and the
     subterfuge of superficially
     different data arrangements.

MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
     We are talking about representation of things, rather
     than what things are.

JA:  The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated
     knowledge of being, is not a day I think that any of
     our sort will see this side of heaven.  The only way that
     we "fallible and mortal finite information creatures" have to
     approach the One and the Universal is via the Many Appearances,
     by taking up as many different styles and types of representations
     as we hope to fathom, and then, by way of transformations on them, to
     distill what invariants, half concealing, half disclosing, they manifest.

MW:  So it is innapropriate to discuss whether an activity is (or is not)
                               ^^^^^^^  
     a spatio-temporal extent?  (Not everything is about representation).

JA:  But everything we discuss is discussed in a discussion.
     And all we represent is represented in a representation.
     I do not see how changing the subject of discussion can
     suddenly render us capable of direct infallible knowledge
     of the being of things, do you?

MW:  If we set the representation by relations
     of particular adacity aside, I think we
     would find much more to agree about.

JA:  Well, that is a heavenly notion.
     But, alas, I must tarry here below.
     I still have so much work to do, y'know.
 
JA:  The only residual dross of the matter appears
     to turn on the circumstance that some people
     cannot yet distinguish a relation from an
     element of one.

MW:  But there is no difference, except in perspective.

JA:  There is a big difference between a relation and a tuple,
     and there is a big difference between articulating the
     structure of a relation and articulating the structure
     of a tuple.  The circumstance that you keep trying to
     gloss over these basic facts with these sorts of glib
     cliches is not going to render you much service with
     regard to your expressed goal in this discussion:

| MW:  One reason I am pursuing this discussion is that
|      if there really are things it cannot handle,
|      I would really like to know.
 
MW:  OK well let me first try to state a method, you will have
     to forgive some lack of formality,  but it should not be
     so unclear what I mean.

MW:  Where I come from this method would be
     informally known as reification.

Having seen more of your elaboration of what you are actually doing,
I begin to see this more as a matter of two kinds of embedding that
you are carrying out on the given relation, and one of these brands
of embedding, extension, or extenuation does have a relation to the
operation that is classically known as "hypostatic abstraction", or
else as "reification".  But all of these operations act to increase
the arity of the relation, so I really do not see how they help the
case that you want to establish.  I will split off these issues and
take them up in another note.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~METHOD~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  Purpose:

V1:  To take any n-adic relation occurrence
     and turn it into n binary relations
     without loss of meaning.

V2:  To take what is represented by an n-ary relation,
     and represent it by n binary relations and
     a set/class of objects.

JA:  I am taking the sense of your later explanations to be
     that "n-adic relation occurrence" is just an "n-tuple",
     otherwise known as an "n-adic relation instance".

JA:  Of course, it would only be interesting
     if an entire n-adic relation, not just
     a single n-tuple, was being converted
     into 2-adic relations, right?

MW:  Of course.

MW:  Method:

V1:  Create an object (say e) that stands for
     the n-adic relation instance as a whole.

V1:  e replaces the tuple rather than a relation.
     So e replaces &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;.

V1:  This does not mean that e = &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;.
     There is a relationship, but it is one of derivability
     rather than equality.

JA:  I still do not get this bit about "derivability, not equality".

MW:  There is something in a later e-mail that relates to this.
     It is really that the relationship between the two is that
     they represent the same thing, rather than actually are
     themselves (a constant and a tuple) the same thing.

JA:  That was what I was guessing back when you were
     using the phrase "stands for".  But I believe that
     we will now have to think a bit -- okay, a lot! --
     more carefully about the sign relations that you have
     just invoked, that is, about what things are the objects
     of what signs, and how, and when.

V1:  Take each each component in the relation occurrence --
     the relation occurrence is a tuple, a component is the thing
     in a place in a tuple, so &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt; --
     and create a relation between it and e.
 
V2:  For each tuple 

     &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;

     that is a member of the n-ary relation (L) create exactly
     one object (e) that is a member of the set of objects (E).

JA:  Just for the sake of concreteness as I attempt to follow along,
     let me try this method out on one or two of the above examples.

JA:  Relation L(&amp;) = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x &amp; y = z}.

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  So, for each tuple &lt;x, y, z&gt; in L(&amp;)
     create exactly one object e in set E.

     E  =  {e&lt;0&gt;, e&lt;1&gt;, e&lt;2&gt;, e&lt;3}.

JA:  Why don't we get really clever and
     use a binary index for the e's?

     E  =  {e&lt;00&gt;, e&lt;01&gt;, e&lt;10&gt;, e&lt;11&gt;}.

MW:  For each component of the tuple create a binary tuple
     that is a member of a relation that indicates the place
     in the original tuple that the component stands in, e.g.:

     place1 &lt;e, component1&gt;

JA:  I will revert to my custom here and employ the
     standard-use-onyms of "coordinate projections".

     Proj&lt;1&gt;(e) = x.
     Proj&lt;2&gt;(e) = y.
     Proj&lt;3&gt;(e) = z.

MW:  You lost me again.

JA:  Alright, the application of the 2-adic relation
     that you are denoting by means of the expression,

     "place1 &lt;e, component1&gt;",

     is the same thing "for all practical purposes" (FAPP)
     as the application of the "1st coordinate projection"
     that I'm denoting by means of the following equation,
     between the applied function and its specified value:

     "Proj&lt;1&gt;(e) = component1".

JA:  More abstractly, that is, abstracting from these
     particular applications, the 2-adic relation that
     you name "place1", supposing it to be a subset of
     a cartesian product, in this case, place1 c E x X,
     is in fact the special brand of a 2-adic relation
     that is commonly called a "function", in particular,
     being "functional" from "domain" E to "codomain" X.
     People -- people who speak loosely for just about
     as long as they can get away with it -- often take
     the liberty of using the very same name under the
     variant type, writing, say, "place1 : E -&gt; X".
     We, however, are past the point, or not yet to
     the point, of being able to get away with this.

MW:  OK I follow this (not quite the same as understand).

We will just have to find some path to understanding.

Until Then,

Jon Awbrey
