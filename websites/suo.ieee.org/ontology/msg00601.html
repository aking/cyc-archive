&gt; Hi Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; 	I think we already have or are in the process of creating the
&gt; documents you want.  See my comments below.

MW: If this were true why would I make the comment? I have better things to
do.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dear James and Colleagues,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let me set out some of the documents (or types of document) I 
&gt; &gt; think we need:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Architecture and Principles
&gt; 
&gt; How would this differ from the Standard and Purpose of the SUO?

MW: I don't know what you mean by Standard here (do you mean scope?). The
purpose would be an integral part of the architecture and principles. But it
would be one page of what I would see as a 20-30 page (not counting boiler
plate) document.

Other things that would be required are:
 - The scope. What is definitely in, what is definitely out.
 - The architecture. This should talk about and describe the skeleton of the
ontology that is to be fleshed out. e.g. we might include areas like:
   - Backbone - perhaps both a 3D and a 4D backbone with a mapping between
them
   - different sorts of whole part
   - elements of set theory, e.g. classification, subclassof, disjoint
   - connections
 - Principles - probably just an outline, pointing to a more detailed
methodology document.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Languages (KIF)
&gt; &gt;     - Requirements
&gt; &gt;     - Language Reference Manual
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't this embodied in the SUO-KIF reference manual (a work 
&gt; in progress):
&gt; <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/suo-kif.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/suo-kif.html</A>

MW: The 2nd of these is the SUO-KIF reference manual. I haven't seen a
statement of requirements that this reference manual is supposed to satisfy,
and I don't see evidence that it yet meets the practical requirements for
developing an SUO.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. Methodology for ontology development
&gt; &gt;     - Usage of KIF
&gt; &gt;     - Ontology Structuring Principles
&gt; &gt;     - Ontology Integration Principles and Methodology
&gt; &gt;     - Ontology Mapping Principles and Methodology
&gt; 
&gt; I've inserted (at the end of this message) my statement of 
&gt; the methodology
&gt; regarding merging/aligning ontologies.  Are you saying that we need
&gt; something more than this?

MW: Yes. See "developing high quality data models" 
<A  HREF="http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle/data/mdlgdocs.htm">http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle/data/mdlgdocs.htm</A>
for an example of the sort of document I think we need for the first two,
and ISO 18876-2 "Mapping and integration methodology" for the sort fo thing
I think we need for the second two.

Not having these is OK if you are the only person who is going to create and
maintain this ontology (and probably use it). But I hope the point here is
that what we do is transparant, and maintainable and extensible by others
follosingn the same approach that we have done. So far we only have what you
think (from time to time) is a good idea, first moving this way, then that
way on the tide of current opinion. (By the way, I'm not suggesting that
there is something else you could have done in the absence of the documents
I am seeking.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. Ontology Parts
&gt; &gt;     - A series of parts, each probably quite small 
&gt; &gt;       (smaller than the Ian Niles document) that 
&gt; &gt;       can be used in groups together for particular
&gt; &gt;       purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, the "Merged Ontology" is comprised of nine relatively
&gt; self-contained sections, viz. "Structural Ontology", "General 
&gt; Classes and
&gt; Axioms", "Agent Hierarchy", "Number Hierarchy", "Units of Measure",
&gt; "Organism Hierarchy", "Temporal Definitions/Axioms", "Mereotopological
&gt; Definitions/Axioms", and "Positional Relations".  Are you 
&gt; saying that we
&gt; need a more fine-grained division that this?

MW: This is a problem (I think) with KIF first of all.

What I am saying is that it is already clear that a monolithic ontology will
become unmanageable, if it hasn't already become so. I think we need what I
think John has described as a Lattice of Theorems, or at least my
interpretation of what he meant. That is that each theorem should be managed
as a separate piece of KIF - this give manageability. But we also need to
know as part of the theorem, which other theorems it is dependent on (I
think we can allow dependence to be inherited). This implies that we need
constructs in KIF to support this. So we need to be able to define a
collection of KIF statements as a theory, and be able to give in a theory
the list of other theories it is dependent on.

You do not have any of this structure even informally, so no user would know
which bits of the SUO he needs if say he is just interested in holes.

If this can already be done with KIF as it is, I would appreciate an
explaination.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; =========================================
&gt; Procedure for Merging/Aligning Ontologies
&gt; =========================================
&gt; 
&gt; The procedure I used in merging aligning ontologies is as 
&gt; follows.  The
&gt; first step was to convert all of the ontologies listed on the 
&gt; SUO Candidate
&gt; Content web page (<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>) into 
&gt; SUO-KIF.  Once
&gt; this was accomplished, I selected the most general ontology 
&gt; (John Sowa's
&gt; upper level ontology) as the base ontology.  I then mapped 
&gt; concepts/axioms
&gt; from the remaining ontologies into the base ontology.  In this mapping
&gt; process, there were two possible cases, each in turn with two 
&gt; subcases.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  New content (Nothing in the merged ontology corresponds with the
&gt; concept/axiom to be mapped)
&gt; 
&gt;   	a. Useful/Relatively Noncontroversial content.  In this 
&gt; subcase, the
&gt; new concept/axiom is deemed to 	be useful and not to 
&gt; violate any cherished
&gt; philosophical principles.  Once I decided that the new 	
&gt; concept/axiom should
&gt; be included, it was simply a matter of finding a place for it in the
&gt; ontology.  	In some cases, this required creating some intermediate
&gt; levels of concepts between existing 	concepts and new content.  These
&gt; intermediate levels were identified in an earlier email 
&gt; directed 	at
&gt; John Sowa on "trouble spots" in the merged ontology.  An 
&gt; example of this
&gt; subcase is the 	subhierarchy of numbers that was taken 
&gt; from the KIF-Numbers
&gt; ontology on the Ontolingua server. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	(subclass-of RealNumber Number)
&gt; 	(subclass-of RationalNumber RealNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of PositiveRealNumber RealNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NegativeRealNumber RealNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of Integer RationalNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of EvenInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of OddInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NaturalNumber Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NonnegativeInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NegativeInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of PositiveInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of PositiveNumber Number)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NegativeNumber Number)
&gt; 	(subclass-of ComplexNumber Number) 
&gt; 
&gt; 	b. Useless/Controversial content.  In this subcase, the new
&gt; concept/axiom is judged (by me) to be 	either not useful or too
&gt; controversial for incorporation into a schema that we hope 
&gt; will have both
&gt; broad application and wide acceptance.  This is of course a 
&gt; very subjective
&gt; judgement, but ontology 	merging/alignment is probably 
&gt; much more of
&gt; an art than a science.  An example of content that was 	
&gt; thought to be too
&gt; controversial for inclusion is the following hierarchy of 
&gt; normative notions
&gt; developed by myself.  It is too controversial, because there 
&gt; are many ways
&gt; of categorizing such 	notions, and some have suggested that a 
&gt; version of
&gt; Deontic Logic would be more appropriate for 	capturing the required
&gt; connections.
&gt; 
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of Normative Entity)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Normative)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Proposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of Obligation NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of Agreement NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of JudgementOfEtiquette NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of AestheticJudgement NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of InstitutionalObligation Obligation)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of PersonalObligation Obligation)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of ReligiousObligation InstitutionalObligation)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of LegalObligation InstitutionalObligation)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Old Content (There is some degree of overlap between the 
&gt; merged ontology
&gt; and the concept/axiom to be     mapped)
&gt; 
&gt; 	a.  Perfect Overlap.  In this case, the terms may 
&gt; differ but the new
&gt; concept has the same semantic 	content as a concept 
&gt; already in the merged
&gt; ontology or, with respect to axioms, there is a logical 	
&gt; equivalence
&gt; between the new axiom and an existing axiom.  An example of 
&gt; this sort of
&gt; case occurs in 	the various mereotopological theories.  
&gt; Some philosophers
&gt; use 'part-of' as the primitive notion to 	frame their 
&gt; axioms, some use
&gt; 'overlaps', and still others use some notion of 'connection'. 
&gt;  	However, in
&gt; many cases, axioms across these different systems are 
&gt; logically equivalent.
&gt; 
&gt; 	b.  Partial Overlap.  In this case, there is some 
&gt; overlap in meaning
&gt; between the new content and 	existing concepts or axioms in 
&gt; the merged
&gt; ontology.  An example of this is the case role hierarchy.  	Although
&gt; John Sowa's system of case roles was part of the base 
&gt; ontology (and, hence,
&gt; the original 	merged ontology), I tried to simplify it 
&gt; somewhat to make it
&gt; more like other systems of case roles.  	Both systems follow:
&gt; 
&gt; 	John Sowa's Subhierarchy under 'Role':
&gt; 
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of PrehendingEntity Role)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of PrehendedEntity Role)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Composite PrehendingEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendingEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendedEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Component PrehendedEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Whole Composite)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Substrate Composite)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Part Component)
