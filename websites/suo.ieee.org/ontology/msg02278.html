Pat,

	Thanks for your criticisms of the merged ontology.  Please see my
responses below.

-Ian


&gt; PS. I have been browsing the merged ontology and so far *every single 
&gt; thing* I have seen in it is wrong. In particular (in no particular 
&gt; order):
&gt; 1. the axiom for piece-of is obviously wrong, since it entails that 
&gt; every piece has all the properties of the whole:
&gt; (=&gt; (piece-of ?X ?Y) (forall (?Z) (=&gt; (instance-of ?Y ?Z) 
&gt; (instance-of ?X ?Z))))

I don't see why this strikes you as obviously wrong.  I defined 'piece-of'
to be a specialization of 'part-of', where both of the arguments are
stuff-like entities.  You may believe that such a specialization is not
useful or you may be violating your own dictum that the meaning of a term in
a formal language is determined solely by the axioms that contain it.  It's
hard to see what you're up to here.

&gt; 2. piece-of only applies to ContinuousObjects, which is wrong.

See my comment above.

&gt; 3. OrganicSubstance is a subclass of ContinuousObject, which is 
&gt; either wrong or assumes a strongly mereological view of objecthood.

I don't follow you here.  All I meant by OrganicSubstance is a
ContinuousObject which is also organic.  Of course, you had no way of
knowing this, since I neglected to include any documentation for this
concept.  Sorry about that.

&gt; 4. The explanation for continuousObject does not make sense. It 
&gt; starts "A ContinuousObject is an object in which every part is 
&gt; similar to every other in every relevant respect." which is a 
&gt; contradiction in itself, since some parts presumably contain other 
&gt; parts as parts.

This would be a contradiction only if one assumed that the relevant respects
apply to all of the parts of the original parts, and I am not making this
assumption.  Generally speaking, when one distinguishes stuffs from objects,
one claims that the stuffs are stuff-like only at or above a certain level
of granularity, and, hence, parts of things at this level of granularity
will not be stuff-like. 

&gt; 5. Can something be a selfConnectedObject and also a 
&gt; ContinuousObject? If so, what is a superficial-part-of a 
&gt; ContinuousObject, and if a superficial-part-of is also a part, is it 
&gt; similar in every relevant respect to a non-superficial part? If not, 
&gt; why is the object Continuous; if so, what makes the part superificial?

Yes, the merged ontology allows that a ContinuousObject can also be a
SelfConnectedObject.  A superficial part of a ContinuousObject would be a
part of the ContinuousObject at the surface which has the precise
granularity for the stuff.  A superficial part could be similar in every
relevant respect to a non-superficial part, because I think we're all agreed
that relevant respects do not encompass locative properties.  Finally, part
of what makes a part superficial is that it is located at the surface of the
object.

&gt; 6. An action is a subclass of a HumanCaused Process, which makes 
&gt; actions by animals, computers and other machines logically impossible.

It all depends on how you define the notion of 'Action'.  One can draw a
distinction between events that are intentional and the result of
deliberation and events that are not.  This sort of distinction, you are
right, leaves (most) animals, robots, etc. out of the picture.  However, it
is a crucial concept - in fact, our legal system is founded on it.  If one
wants to create a more general concept that includes both 'Action', as
currently defined, and the things that animals and robots do, this is
possible in the framework of the merged ontology.
