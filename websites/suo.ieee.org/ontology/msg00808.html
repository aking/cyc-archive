&gt; Subject: SUO: RE: RE: RE: RE: RE: #3 "Flawed Approach, etc
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Matthew, 
&gt; 	.		This answers several e-mails from you 
&gt; that have just
&gt; rolled in, addressed to me. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Basically, it is evident I have interpreted some of your
&gt; words as being more hostile to Ian than they apparently were 
&gt; intended to be.

MW: Indeed.

&gt; It still happens when I read them, so it must relate to differences in
&gt; interpretation. It sounded to me that you were opposed to 
&gt; Ian's work being
&gt; continued or kept, and the only benefits would be the lessons 
&gt; learned in
&gt; producing it. 

MW: The main gap is whether you are looking at how far we've come, or
whether you are looking at how far to go. I am doing the latter, so I am
saying we are not nearly finished, indeed we have barely started - if that,
an it is too early to move to a mode where we are taking a document and
trying to develop it to a standard.

MW: From the other end, Ian has done good and useful work that should not be
abandonned.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I hope you have seen from earlier e-mails today that I
&gt; support both your and Ian's work. I hope we can benefit from 
&gt; both of you and
&gt; your products. 

MW: I don't seriously doubt that. Just sometimes when you challenge me for
alternatives that I've already presented it irks a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Your idea about modularising the effort, and working on
&gt; different sections sounds like it has potential, provided 
&gt; compatibility is
&gt; maintained. Naturally, there will have to be agreement 
&gt; between you about the
&gt; divvying up of the work portions. 

MW: Of course part of what you need to be able to work separately with some
hope the pieces will fit together is a framework and methodology. Without
that you have an artifact that can only be maitained by its author. This
would be somewhat limiting.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I accept your assertions that the various 
&gt; documents you have
&gt; sent heave given approaches to merging structures, etc. 
&gt; Possibly, like me,
&gt; Ian has been swamped with all the e-mail traffic on this 
&gt; project. It is
&gt; really getting excessive. 

MW: True.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I don't comprehend the significance of your 
&gt; previous comment
&gt; about EXPRESS being "long on structure and short on axioms". 

MW Data models are normally only able to represent a small range of
constraints (or axioms - axiom is really just a posh word for constraint).
EXPRESS actually has quite a fully featured constraint language, but we
haven't used it in developing the EPISTLE Core Model, mostly a matter of
priorities.

&gt; Does this
&gt; affect its utility? 

MW: No. It just means there is some work still to do. Hardly a surprise.

&gt; I think your gist was possibly that the 
&gt; way would be to
&gt; translate EPISTLE into SUO-KIF anyway, wasn't it? 

MW: Yes, I do not wish to propose using EXPRESS. It jsut happens to be the
language I have used historically, so it is where a lot of the work I have
been involved in is.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I've got to say, I wish these were written in ACE or the
&gt; like. I'd have a chance of reading them myself, then. As it is, any
&gt; contributions are going to be very laboured. 

MW: For you and me both. Personally I think that all KIF should come with
and English translation.

&gt; &gt; Dear Matthew, 
&gt; &gt; 	.		These are instances of colourful 
&gt; &gt; rhetoric putting a
&gt; &gt; definitely emotional perspective. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Well that is one way to describe the use of analogy, but the only
&gt; emotion I am suffering from is frustration that this effort 
&gt; might be dragged
&gt; into a direction where a lot of effort is expended for no 
&gt; great purpose.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	.	However, I suggest they do not present the only ways of
&gt; &gt; viewing the principles you have raised.

&gt; snip
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Ian,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What this says to me is that given some available sources, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have done
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something minimal to bring these sources into one document 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and eliminate any
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obvious conflicts. What you do not convince me of is that you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have a grand
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plan of the parts of the ontology that will be required, the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paradigms that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be supported, and an approach for filling in that 
&gt; framework.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You're right that I don't have a "grand plan of the parts of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ontology
&gt; &gt; &gt; that will be required", and I think this is as it should be.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Oh, so you think it is better to travel without a map.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	If you think you know the map (and I mean the content, 
&gt; &gt; not just the
&gt; &gt; list of required planning and support documentation we need 
&gt; &gt; by the time the
&gt; &gt; project is complete), then, let's see it. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I have developed (and given references to) similar 
&gt; documents for the
&gt; development of data models for similar purposes. When we 
&gt; undertook that work
&gt; in EPISTLE we concluded that it was better to produce those 
&gt; documents (the
&gt; map) before we undertook large scale modelling. It saved a 
&gt; great deal of
&gt; effort. Building models in KIF is not so different from doing so in an
&gt; Entity Relationship language. Most of the issues and 
&gt; principles stay the
&gt; same.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: However, you seem to have a very short memory, so I will 
&gt; repeat again a
&gt; list of document that make a better start point for 
&gt; discussion of what we
&gt; should do and how we should do it than just picking up some 
&gt; bits of ontology
&gt; and merging them together:
&gt; 
&gt; MW: ISO 18876-1 WD5 Integration of Industrial Data for 
&gt; Exchange Access and
&gt; Sharing: Overview and Architecture
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This document shows how a number of different 
&gt; models/ontologies can be
&gt; integrated. The methodology preserves the original 
&gt; model/ontology whilst
&gt; allowing the creation of an integration model/ontology. Different
&gt; integration models/ontologies can be created and linked by application
&gt; models/ontologies that are concepts that can be mapped into both
&gt; models/ontologies.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: ISO 18876-2 WD5 Integration of Industrial Data for 
&gt; Exchange Access and
&gt; Sharing: Integration and Mapping Methodology
&gt; 
&gt; MW: The methodology for how to operate the above architecture.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: "Some notes on the nature of things"
&gt; 
&gt; MW: An outline in plain language of a rationale for 4D a 
&gt; ontology/model.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: The above can be found at <A  HREF="http://www.ISO18876.org">http://www.ISO18876.org</A> if you 
&gt; dig around a
&gt; bit. All have been mentioned several times.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: "Developing High Quality Data Models V2"
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle/data/modelling/">http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle/data/modelling/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This document illustrates a number of traps that that 
&gt; those developing
&gt; data models frequently fall into when developing data models. It also
&gt; presents some principles for how to avoid these traps. In (at 
&gt; least) one
&gt; e-mail exchange here I have presented a version of these 
&gt; principles adapted
&gt; for KIF. They are not that complicated, but the current model does not
&gt; support them.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: EPISTLE Core Model V3.2 Revision 6 (aka ISO 15926-2 DIS draft)
&gt; 
&gt; MW: A data model which I posted in the last few days, part of which I
&gt; translated into KIF in November, and reposted again recently.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: So I really do not understand how you can accuse me of 
&gt; not presenting
&gt; the bits of the map I have. I only wish people would look at 
&gt; it, apparently
&gt; including you.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I am not so arrogant as to suggest that the work 
&gt; mentioned above is
&gt; perfect in any sense. No map is. The point of a map is that it guides
&gt; travellers better than no map at all, and passes on the 
&gt; experience of other
&gt; travellers (or map makers).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will suggest
&gt; &gt; &gt; additions to the ontology, other people will suggest other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; additions, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; some people will argue that some of these proposed additions 
&gt; &gt; &gt; should not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; incorporated into the merged ontology.  I don't think it would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate for one person to provide the entire framework 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a project
&gt; &gt; &gt; that requires the consenus of a wide range of experts.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: The foundation or outline is a level at which we can 
&gt; &gt; discuss what we are
&gt; &gt; going to do and how, without actually wasting a lot of time 
&gt; &gt; doing things at
&gt; &gt; the detailed level. Of course it is not for one person to 
&gt; &gt; decide, any more
&gt; &gt; than the detail is. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	Fine, but that doesn't damn Ian's work to date. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Where have I damned Ian's work? I have been careful to say it is
&gt; valuable. It is just not a good enough starting point for 
&gt; standardisation.
&gt; In my view the big mistake here is asking for a vote, and 
&gt; more particularly
&gt; the nature of what we were asked to vote on.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm  not sure what
&gt; &gt; &gt; you mean by the "paradigms that will be supported".  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: e.g. 3D and 4D.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As for  an approach for
&gt; &gt; &gt; filling in the ontology, my plan is to align the remaining 
&gt; &gt; &gt; candidate SUO
&gt; &gt; &gt; sources with the merged ontology. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we start somewhere, and move off in some direction without 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where we are trying to get to, then there is no reason why we 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should arrive
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the desired place, because we don't even know how to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recognise it if we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arrived there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree.  I am using the "IEEE SUO Scope and Purpose" as my 
&gt; &gt; &gt; guide, and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope others are as well.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: That's a bit like saying "The objective is to win the 
&gt; &gt; war, now lets just
&gt; &gt; start skirmishing and see where we go"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GH&gt;	It's a bit like saying all sorts of other things as 
&gt; &gt; well. We don't
&gt; &gt; have an enemy for starters. I suggest analogies should be as 
&gt; &gt; precise as
&gt; &gt; possible, and I don't think this one is. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: OK it is like starting a large project without a project 
&gt; plan, or it is
&gt; like constructing a complex engineering artifact without a 
&gt; design. It is
&gt; anything large where you start withou knowing where you are 
&gt; going, or or how
&gt; you are going to get there.
&gt; &gt;
