Dear John,

This doesn't help us much. In particular it doesn;t answer the question we
started with, which is "Is an activity a relation?" where at least Pat,
Chris P and I would argue that an activity is a spatio-temporal extent, and
would feel uncompfortable that a relation was a spatio-temporal extent. On
the hand many others note that activities are frequently modelled as
relations. Perhaps it is OK to do both, in which case is this inconsistent?
Or does it just not matter?

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew, Mike, et al.,
&gt; 
&gt; That is a very serious and very difficult question:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call what 
&gt; it is in the real
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;world that they refer to?
&gt; 
&gt; As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box
&gt; of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
&gt; realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
&gt; use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
&gt; together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
&gt; other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
&gt; Java, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they
&gt; refer to in the real world?" all hell breaks loose.
&gt; 
&gt; You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
&gt; what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestion:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
&gt;     interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
&gt;     satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
&gt;     is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
&gt;     purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
&gt;     realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
&gt;     words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
&gt;     let's not worry too much about what it is.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
&gt;     the position that KIF is the official language to be used
&gt;     for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
&gt;     If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.
&gt; 
&gt; I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out"
&gt; that doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the
&gt; same cop out that Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his
&gt; Tractatus:  "Everything that can be said can be said clearly,
&gt; and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent."
&gt; 
&gt; For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some
&gt; extra prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in
&gt; the SUO] can be said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot
&gt; speak [in KIF], thereof we must be silent.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not an answer to the question of what do relations
&gt; really refer to.  It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the
&gt; only kind of cop out that will allow us to get some work done.
&gt;
