Pat,

A really small, niggling point.

You wrote:
"I think what Matthew may have been talking about are cases where
something might have an intermittent existence. This isn't plausible
for physical things, but there are some reasonably intuitive
examples."

It seems to me that it can be plausible for some kinds of physical objects.
Wouldn't it be better to say that we normally do not think of physical
things as having intermittent existence. But that there are examples. I seem
to remember someone mentioning the polar ice cap in one SUO message
(apparently it sometimes melts away completely). Another geographical
example would be rivers that run dry. It seems to me that my car's front
right wheel is a physical object (though some might want to relegate this to
a role - whatever that it is) - over the life of my car, this wheel has had
an intermittent existence.

The substantive point behind this - for me - is that temporal continuity is
good requirement for identity (temporal unity) but unfortunately not an
absolute rule.

Regards,
Chris

&gt;------------
&gt;On time intervals:
&gt;[Pat Hayes (paper)}:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  A timeinterval is a connected piece of the time-plenum.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Things that have a temporal extent, or which occupy time in some
&gt; &gt; &gt; way, must have a time interval which is their life-span.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Just a check on what you mean here. An object may also
&gt; &gt; have many time intervals of existance, not just one. Right?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;    That section is a quote from Pat Hayes's paper, and my
&gt;interpretation of that sentence is that there is some timepoint before
&gt;which a temporally-located object did not exist (in the real world),
&gt;and a time after which it no longer exists.  I am unfamiliar with
&gt;the concept you refer to as having "many time intervals of existence"
&gt;(unless you are thinking of observations by different observers using
&gt;different clocks in a relativistic framework).  Is there a reference
&gt;to a discussion of that manner of representation?

I think what Matthew may have been talking about are cases where
something might have an intermittent existence. This isnt plausible
for physical things, but there are some reasonably intuitive
examples. My favorite is the concept of a 'shed' in weaving, which is
the space through which the shuttle passes *when the heddles are in a
certain configuration*, each different heddle defining a diferent
'shed'. The same piece of physical space therefore 'becomes' a
different shed when the heddles are changed, and each shed comes into
and goes out of existence as the fabric is woven. Another example
might be a 'session' of a committee which meets regularly, or the
activity of writing a book over a long period, interrupted by things
like sleeping.

There have been attempts to figure out a calculus of 'intermittent'
time-intervals, but I don't know of any fully successful ones. The
relationships between arbitrary such intervals are much more complex
than  those between connected intervals. (BTW, algebras for
relativistic intervals have been worked out. The 13 'linear'
relationships become, as I recall, around 19 possibilities in special
relativity. This might seem like a purely academic exercise, but it
has realistic applications whenever one has to consider transmission
speeds which are comparable to the normal time measures, eg as in
communication in networks.)
