Aldo,

Pat objected to the word "intended" (which I consider something
that can only be inferred, at best approximately, from context).
But I also object to the word "average", which seems to imply
some kind of context-independent meaning.

I don't believe that the range of meanings of a word is
arbitrary, but I don't believe in an "average" meaning
that is independent of context.

&gt;IMO, what computational ontology (as far as lexical items are 
&gt;concerned) is trying to do is formally approximating the 
&gt;conceptualization that an average reader from our current dominant 
&gt;(or shared) culture assumes when reading a lexical item. In other 
&gt;words, only some possible models for a lexical item are committed to 
&gt;in a given ontology. The more general an ontology claims to be, the 
&gt;more it assumes the conceptualization of that average reader 
&gt;independently of any context of use. The more domain-oriented an 
&gt;ontology is, the more it describes the conceptualization of an 
&gt;average reader for a restricted community or context.

As an example, consider the following sentence:

   "Mary had a little lamb."

Then consider the following three continuations:

 1. "Its fleece was white as snow."

 2. "The rice was white as snow."

 3. "The doctors were amazed"

In context #1, she was playing with her pet; in #2, she
was eating it; and in #3, she was giving birth to it.

&gt; In this 
&gt;perspective, intentions are not _disturbing_ or _dangerous_ to 
&gt;computational ontology per se, but they should be _neutralized_ under 
&gt;certain conditions in order to give machines something that they can 
&gt;share with humans.

I don't believe that intentions are dangerous or disturbing,
and I certainly don't believe that they should be neutralized.
I don't believe that anyone (human or machine) can ever know
someone else's intentions exactly, but I do believe that both
humans and machines can infer a great deal about them from
context (although humans are certainly better at it than
most current computer systems).

There is a lot more to be said, but to be brief, I believe
that something along the lines of Wittgenstein's language
games is the way to go -- both for average human beings in
so-called "average" situations and for the most esoteric
specialists in any field.

In fact, I agree with the anthropologist Clifford Geertz,
who observed that anybody who does not belong to one's
immediate group is, in some respect, "exotic":

   "The problem of how a Copernican understands a Ptolemaian,
   a fifth republic Frenchman an _ancien regime_ one, or a poet
   a painter is seen to be on all fours with the problem of
   how a Christian understands a Muslim, a European an Asian,
   an anthropologist an aborigine, or vice versa.  We are all
   natives now, and everybody else not immediately one of us
   is an exotic.  What looked once to be a matter of finding
   out whether savages could distinguish fact from fancy now
   looks to be a matter of finding out how others, across the
   sea or down the corridor, organize their significative world.

From C. Geertz, _Local Knowledge_, Basic Books, 1983.
