Dear Phil,

This looks like a good idea. Do I take it you are offering to take
maintaining this on as a task?

&gt; Dear Matthew, and SUO Group in general,
&gt; 
&gt; Along the lines that you have proposed below, I think it 
&gt; would also be a
&gt; good idea for the SUO group to collectively, iteratively 
&gt; develop a web-based
&gt; SUO Glossary of specialized ontological terminology (e.g. 
&gt; defining phrases
&gt; like "4D Endurantist") including any terms that might be 
&gt; invented and then
&gt; used frequently within SUO correspondence...
&gt; 
&gt; One way to do this would be to use www.quickbase.com, to very 
&gt; easily set up
&gt; a database of terms  that people could update dynamically.... 
&gt; I thnk I could
&gt; do this very easily -- Do others think this is a good idea, 
&gt; and if so, is
&gt; there another, better way that it should be done?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

&gt; &gt; Dear Graham,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think some of the things we need to do is to write down 
&gt; the "fundamental
&gt; &gt; principles" of the different metaphysical paradigms which 
&gt; different people
&gt; &gt; use. Pat (with interjections from Nicola) has been doing a lot of
&gt; &gt; good work
&gt; &gt; educating us on some of the issues.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm reasonably comfortable my "notes on the nature of 
&gt; things" makes a good
&gt; &gt; start point for doing this for the 4D viewpoint. It would be
&gt; &gt; useful to have
&gt; &gt; something similar for the continuant/occurrent approach 
&gt; (perhaps Pat or
&gt; &gt; Nicola could oblige?) and for the Piercean viewpoint (John?).
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;In a message today, Ian Niles includes many of his documentation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;strings, such as:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;---------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(documentation Continuant "A continuant is any entity whose
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parts are wholly
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;present whenever it is present.")
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;----------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And later in the same message he writes:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;---------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;These docu-strings are supposed to make the meaning
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the concepts clear to people who weren't involved in
&gt; &gt; &gt; constructing the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ontology.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;----------------------
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with the stated goal, but I offer all of our current
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;documentation strings as evidence that we are nowhere 
&gt; near that goal.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;To pick on this one example, a "man on the street" (and 
&gt; most of us)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;would have no idea of what a Continuant is based on this 
&gt; definition.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Let's see, ...an entity whose parts are wholly present 
&gt; whenever it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is present.  I first strain to think of anything that doesn't fit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;this category.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, an example might be a football match. It has a 
&gt; first half and a
&gt; &gt; &gt; second half, and when one of them is present the other isn't.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here are more explanatory docu-strings, but they are more like
&gt; &gt; &gt; mini-essays. Is this the kind of thing you had in mind?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (documentation Continuant " Intuitively, an object-like thing as
&gt; &gt; &gt; opposed to an event-like thing; something that endures rather than
&gt; &gt; &gt; something that happens. A continuant is thought of as continuing
&gt; &gt; &gt; through time, but at any particular time is all there at 
&gt; that time,
&gt; &gt; &gt; in contrast to something that is thought of as being divided into
&gt; &gt; &gt; stages (contrast "Occurrent"). Examples include normal physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; objects, geographical regions, things like corporations 
&gt; or nations,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and locations of occurrents. The formal definition is that all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; parts of a continuant are present at the same time that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuant is; in other words, a continuant cannot have 
&gt; 'parts' which
&gt; &gt; &gt; are separated in time, such as the first and second halves of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; football game.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that the parts of a continuant may change from time 
&gt; to time, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; that every continuant occupies exactly the same space and 
&gt; time as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; occurrent (its lifetime).
&gt; &gt; &gt; In a 4-d ontology, a continuant is something whose spatiotemporal
&gt; &gt; &gt; extent is thought of as dividing into spatial parts 
&gt; roughly parallel
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the time-axis.
&gt; &gt; &gt; See Occurrent/Continuant-contrast-note.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (documentation Occurrent "Intuitively, an event-like 
&gt; thing as opposed
&gt; &gt; &gt; to an object-type thing; something that happens rather 
&gt; than something
&gt; &gt; &gt; that endures. An occurrent is thought of as having 
&gt; temporal parts or
&gt; &gt; &gt; stages, and it so cannot have all these parts together at one time
&gt; &gt; &gt; (contrast "Continuant"). Examples include extended 
&gt; 'events' such as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; football match or a race, processes of various kinds, states of
&gt; &gt; &gt; motion and lifetimes of continuants, which occupies the same space
&gt; &gt; &gt; and time but is thought of as having stages instead of parts. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; formal definition is: anything that lasts for a time but is not a
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuant.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that an occurrent may have participants 'inside' it which are
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuants, such as the players in a football match.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In a 4-d ontology, a continuant is something whose spatiotemporal
&gt; &gt; &gt; extent is thought of as dividing into temporal stages roughly
&gt; &gt; &gt; perpendicular to the time-axis.
&gt; &gt; &gt; See Occurrent/Continuant-contrast-note.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, maybe it means something that's not missing any 
&gt; of its parts,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;so a car that's missing its back seat would not be a 
&gt; Continuant (?).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But what does "wholly present" mean?  Does it mean the parts are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;correctly assembled and not just lying in a pile?  If my 
&gt; car's back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;set is sitting on the ground beside it, is it wholly present?  If
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it's in the same garage, or the same city, or the same 
&gt; state, is it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wholly present?   How close does it have to be to be present?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;It turns out that the author is apparently not using the word
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;"parts" in any normal sense,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ironically, it IS being used in pretty much the normal 
&gt; sense in that
&gt; &gt; &gt; definition of continuant; the sense in which your hand 
&gt; and your liver
&gt; &gt; &gt; are parts of you , but your childhood isn't part of you 
&gt; (its a stage
&gt; &gt; &gt; - temporal part- of your lifetime, in this way of talking.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;but probably means it to refer to temporal parts (a completely
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;foreign usage to anyone but us).  Or does it also refer 
&gt; to physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;parts at the same time?  If a set is an entity, do 
&gt; members of a set
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;count as its parts,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; NO!  Wash your mouth out with soap!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and how can we tell whether they are "present" or not, or whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the set itself is present?  These are the sorts of 
&gt; questions anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;might have when reading this definition.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;My recommendation is that we should focus on getting rich
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;definitions written for these concepts, so that we can all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;understand them before we go any further.  The definitions should
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;include all the explanatory text we can create, including
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;discussions of where the boundaries of each concept are 
&gt; (i.e., what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;barely fits this definition, and what just misses?).  
&gt; There should
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be plenty of examples of the full range of entities that fit the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;category, and of some that don't, and why not.  Perhaps we want a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;second relation like "discussion" where all the issues and subtle
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;problems with each concept are stored.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, Cyc has these extended mini-essays in places, and 
&gt; they are very
&gt; &gt; &gt; useful for giving a kind of survey of a connected bunch of tricky
&gt; &gt; &gt; concepts. For example, Cyc has about seven (ten?) 
&gt; distinct ways that
&gt; &gt; &gt; one thing might 'cover' something else, and without the 
&gt; guide nobody
&gt; &gt; &gt; could possibly follow exactly what they mean. Here's one 
&gt; that might
&gt; &gt; &gt; be useful:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (documentation Occurrent/Continuant-contrast-note " The 
&gt; question of
&gt; &gt; &gt; deciding whether something is a continuant or an occurrent can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; subtle. Notice it only arises for entities that are 
&gt; located in space
&gt; &gt; &gt; and time: abstract things like sets and numbers are not 
&gt; classified in
&gt; &gt; &gt; either of these ways. (Note in particular that a set of physical
&gt; &gt; &gt; things is not itself physical.) The basic test is to ask 
&gt; whether the
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing in question is best thought of as something that 
&gt; can be said to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be 'happening' or whether one thinks of it as something 
&gt; that endures
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a time and participates in happenings. As an alternative
&gt; &gt; &gt; criterion, consider a time just before the thing in 
&gt; question exists.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think of it as just going to start (occurrent), or as just
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to be created (continuant)?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Many physical things, however, can be thought of as being either a
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuant or an occurrent. Examples include localized processes
&gt; &gt; &gt; forming objects whose identity arises from dynamic 
&gt; equilibrium, such
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a rainstorm, an ocean wave, a flame, a fountain plume, 
&gt; a river or
&gt; &gt; &gt; even a human body. In such cases the ontologist may need 
&gt; to introduce
&gt; &gt; &gt; two kinds of entities, one to express the continuant or enduring
&gt; &gt; &gt; nature and the other the occurrent or process nature of 
&gt; the thing in
&gt; &gt; &gt; question. For example, an ocean wave can be thought of as a moving
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuant which at each moment is manifested by a local occurrent
&gt; &gt; &gt; consisting of the motion of a part of the ocean surface. A
&gt; &gt; &gt; thunderstorm viewed in a satellite image can be seen as a moving
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuant, but seen from one position on the ground may 
&gt; be thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; of as an occurrent (with stages of the sky darkening, 
&gt; rain beginning
&gt; &gt; &gt; to fall, etc.). A similar duality is seen in the contrast 
&gt; between a
&gt; &gt; &gt; motion and the thing moving, and the contrast between a continuant
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as a person and that person's lifetime, which must 
&gt; be thought of
&gt; &gt; &gt; as an occurrent. In general, if one is unsure how to classify some
&gt; &gt; &gt; piece of a complex system, the safest strategy is to treat it as
&gt; &gt; &gt; having both aspects and introduce them both into the ontology, so
&gt; &gt; &gt; that enduring things always have lifetimes during which 
&gt; things happen
&gt; &gt; &gt; to them, and happenings are always happening to something.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In a 4-d ontology there is no sharp contrast between occurrent and
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuant, and the same thing may be spatiotemporally 
&gt; divided up in
&gt; &gt; &gt; several different ways. In particular, a continuant can 
&gt; be identified
&gt; &gt; &gt; with its lifetime. This makes for fewer entities, but 
&gt; requires that
&gt; &gt; &gt; one specify carefully how properties are distributed with 
&gt; respect to
&gt; &gt; &gt; spatiotemporal divisions. One way to view the 
&gt; continuant/occurrrent
&gt; &gt; &gt; contrast is as a crude but useful system for making such
&gt; &gt; &gt; specifications.")
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This last paragraph might be too controversial to be included,
&gt; &gt; &gt; however, as it would ruffle endurantist feathers.
