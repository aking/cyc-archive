Graham,

	You suggest:

&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt;	.	I propose that Ian Niles be accepted as the co-ordinator and
&gt; developer of the SUO content, on the basis that no-one else is proposing
or
&gt; offering to undertake the work. 

&gt;	.	I further propose that the SUO content co-ordinator and
&gt; developer be required to advise the group of every change that s/he makes
on
&gt; their own initiative, so that the merits of each such change can be
&gt; considered by the other group members. 

	Good suggestions, but we can't do this unless the SUO group decides
whether it is going to do work on this document.  Many have voted for the
group to NOT take on this work, so they would justifiably be upset if we
took steps like this.

	If this votes passes, we will select a Technical Editor and make
sure that the process is open, but if it doesn't pass, we should not take
the steps you propose.

Jim








	.	RE: #4 'Practical Purpose': I have addressed the issue of
potential alternative start points several times recently. Only one
alternative has so far even been registered, but, so far, no-one is prepared
to champion even that. We're quite prepared to consider any suggestions on
their merits.  

	.	Since you evidently feel "that what we currently have is too
far from something that would be an acceptable standard, that it does not
constitute a start point", what do you suggest as the alternative????
Numbers of us are eagerly waiting to actually hear a positive option rather
than just another criticism. Matthew, the ball is in your court!!

Proposed Solution: 
	.	(None was provided by Matthew) I propose that the current
development work by Ian Niles be continued until someone actually proposes a
viable alternative. 

	.	RE: #5 'Email Process': I agree about the resourcing problem
with the more usual standards development approach you mention. Another
issue is that it is necessarily far slower than other approaches are capable
of being - that's one of the reasons the Internet is being taken up as a
mean of facilitating and expediting work. 

	.	In regard to your final comment that: "We could make the
e-mail stuff work better than it does", I wish to suggest an oft used and
well proven approach, including in standards development. This is that each
comment include a "proposed solution". This works best when the proposed
solution provides actual suggested alternative content that can be readily
assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem. 

	.	I suggest that, if this approach is undertaken, then we will
make far better and faster progress.  

Proposed Solution: 
	.	I propose that all future comments on the SUO development
each include a "proposed solution". As far as possible, the proposed
solution is to provide actual suggested alternative content that can be
readily assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem.
Comments that do not do this will not be ignored, but their adoption cannot
be achieved until a satisfactory proposed solution has been identified and
accepted.

Dear Jim,

I think the issue here is that what we currently have is too far from
something that would be an acceptable standard, that it does not constitute
a start point.

&gt; Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat and John 
&gt; say - is not
&gt; sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as 
&gt; Matthew says - does
&gt; not seem to be ready for practical use.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that - as it stands - the Ontology is not 
&gt; really a standard
&gt; that is fit for any practical purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of making concrete
&gt; suggestions via email is adequate for the task at hand. A point that a
&gt; number of people have made in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete 
&gt; suggestion for a way
&gt; to produce an adequate product. I think the task is of a size 
&gt; that anything
&gt; I would suggest would involve the old standards such as a project with
&gt; resources and a plan that gave some substance to the process 
&gt; of analysis to
&gt; be followed and the deliverables. But there is no point in 
&gt; starting this
&gt; unless there is some kind of commitment in terms of resources.
&gt;
