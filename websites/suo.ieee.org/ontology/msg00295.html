Bernard,

I have had in mind for quite a long while now finishing
my answer to your queries on Peirce's "way of writing",
and I think that maybe today is the day.  Here, for the
sake of refreshing our memories, are the last two beads
on this thread:

&gt; 
&gt; Bernard, &amp; All,
&gt; 
&gt; I do not think that Peirce's use of capitalization
&gt; is very consistent or terribly significant -- he is
&gt; probably just making an attempt to follow the usual
&gt; conventions of ordinary or mathematical discourse,
&gt; as the case may be, whatever was customary for the
&gt; times, the audience, and the occasion of writing.
&gt; In the case of published works, it is more than
&gt; likely that a particular style of emphasis was
&gt; enforced by editorial policy or persuasion.
&gt; 
&gt; There are several such likely conventions that I abduce
&gt; are being observed in the particular text that you cite:
&gt; 
&gt; | But at this point certain distinctions are called for.
&gt; | That which is communicated from the object through the
&gt; | Sign to the interpretant is a Form;  that is to say,
&gt; | it is nothing like an existent, but it is a power, is
&gt; | the fact that something would happen on certain conditions.
&gt; | This form is really embodied in the object, meaning that
&gt; | the conditional relation which constitutes the form is
&gt; | true of the form or it is in the Object.  In the Sign
&gt; | it is embodied only in a representative sense, meaning
&gt; | that whether by virtue of some real modification of the
&gt; | Sign, or otherwise, the Sign becomes endowed with the
&gt; | power of communicating it to an interpretant.
&gt; |
&gt; | (Manuscript MS 793, quoted from
&gt; |  R. Marty, l'algèbre des signes, pp. 382)
&gt; 
&gt; In mathematical discourse, then and now, it is very common to use
&gt; some style of emphasis (bold face, initial or full capitalization,
&gt; italics, quotation, or underlining (especially on the chalkboard))
&gt; to indicate that a word is either being defined-in-passing by the
&gt; context in which it is used, or else being used as a "term of art"
&gt; in a special technical sense, one that may be limited to the likes
&gt; of its indicated context.  If a definition 'en passant' is intended,
&gt; the empahsis will typically only appear on the first (or a critical)
&gt; token of the term, as with Peirce's use of "Form" and "form" above.
&gt; If a technical nomen is intended, then the emphasis will typically
&gt; be applied throughout, as in Peirce's use of "Sign" and "Object".
&gt; 
&gt; As to content, Peirce is speaking straight out of Aristotle's mouth here --
&gt; or is it vice versa!? -- where form is actuality and matter is potentiality
&gt; and where the two are blended and bound together -- or was it shearly in our
&gt; imaginations that they ever became separated!? -- in the animated material form
&gt; of synthesis that infuses the "living inferential metaboly of symbols".
&gt; 
&gt; | a.  The theories of the soul (psyche)
&gt; |     handed down by our predecessors have
&gt; |     been sufficiently discussed;  now let
&gt; |     us start afresh, as it were, and try to
&gt; |     determine (diorisai) what the soul is,
&gt; |     and what definition (logos) of it will
&gt; |     be most comprehensive (koinotatos).
&gt; |
&gt; | b.  We describe one class of existing things as
&gt; |     substance (ousia), and this we subdivide into
&gt; |     three:  (1) matter (hyle), which in itself is
&gt; |     not an individual thing, (2) shape (morphe) or
&gt; |     form (eidos), in virtue of which individuality
&gt; |     is directly attributed, and (3) the compound
&gt; |     of the two.
&gt; |
&gt; | c.  Matter is potentiality (dynamis), while form is
&gt; |     realization or actuality (entelecheia), and the
&gt; |     word actuality is used in two senses, illustrated
&gt; |     by the possession of knowledge (episteme) and the
&gt; |     exercise of it (theorein).

&gt; 
&gt; Jon,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the reply.  Your explanation sounds very accurate and I had not thought
&gt; the matter in that way.  This would mean that "Form" indicates something as :
&gt; "a definition of which can be found elsewhere by the reader".
&gt; So I will continue searching for it.
&gt;
&gt; May be that the convention is not wholly alien to the same one for proper names.
&gt; A definition is a relation aiming to show the identity between two terms.
&gt; As such it is individualized and Secondness.  The function of
&gt; a proper name seeems to be very near.
&gt; 
&gt; As to the following, I disagree in part :
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As to content, Peirce is speaking straight out of Aristotle's mouth here --
&gt; &gt; or is it vice versa!? -- where form is actuality and matter is potentiality
&gt; &gt; and where the two are blended and bound together -- or was it shearly in our
&gt; &gt; imaginations that they ever became separated!? -- in the animated material form
&gt; &gt; of synthesis that infuses the "living inferential metaboly of symbols".
&gt; 
&gt; I understood the passage on the contrary as meaning that Form
&gt; is potentiality (or better possibility : Firstness).  Remember :
&gt; CSP writes "Form is not an existent" and thus it cannot be actuality.
&gt; So and if I am not mistaken, matter (as "effete mind") is not opposed
&gt; to form and they could fall both in the same general category of Firstness,
&gt; but in a different way : matter as a degenerate second or dead signs which
&gt; have ceased their living.  Form being much more genuine firstness appeals
&gt; to iconicity and this could be why all that is communicated is a form
&gt; (cf perception theory).
&gt;
&gt; I am not very confident with Aristotle because my philosophical background is
&gt; insufficient.  But is not Peirce refounding the aristotelician categories there?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt;

Bernard &amp; All

There are many important issues here, and I hope that I can,
in time, do them justice.

Here, again, is Peirce's text:

| But at this point certain distinctions are called for.
| That which is communicated from the object through the
| Sign to the interpretant is a Form;  that is to say,
| it is nothing like an existent, but it is a power, is
| the fact that something would happen on certain conditions.
| This form is really embodied in the object, meaning that
| the conditional relation which constitutes the form is
| true of the form or it is in the Object.  In the Sign
| it is embodied only in a representative sense, meaning
| that whether by virtue of some real modification of the
| Sign, or otherwise, the Sign becomes endowed with the
| power of communicating it to an interpretant.
|
| C.S. Peirce, Manuscript MS 793, cited in:
| Robert Marty, L'Algèbre des Signes, p. 382.

Yes, I would agree that "dynamis" (potential, power) is being invoked here,
in this Aristotelian way of speaking that is really being intoned when we echo
that "Knowledge Is Power", without quite knowing, in our empty reverberations,
all throughout the "Scene Of Modern Awareness" (SOMA), what in the world we
are actually saying -- or is that just me?

And so what Peirce means to communicate to us must be a bit like this:
that what the Object conducts through the Sign to the Interpretant Sign,
as a general rule -- and thus as a matter of the conceivable continuity
of its own inherent or inherited  "form of being" (FOB) -- is a "bent",
a dynamis, a form of its own particular form, a generalized conditional
disposition to act, an inclination, a pattern, a potential, a power,
a propensity, a shape of things to come, a virtue, a "would be",
a "wouldn't it be luverly", if you will, and sing along with me.

And yet, independently of how he might sit with Aristotle,
do you actually think that Peirce has in mind or means to
recommend to us either a formless matter or an empty form
that does not matter to quick but mortally embodied souls?

No, I do not think so, and I believe that it is clear just at this point,
in this very passage that Peirce so incidentally marks with a semicolon,
that he is invoking Aristotle's animated synthesis of form and matter,
as if in a single breath, or perhaps a moment' pause between breaths,
to carry the argument from formative objective to formulated power.

| That which is communicated from the object through the Sign
| to the interpretant is a Form;  that is to say, it is nothing
| like an existent, but it is a power, is the fact that something
| would happen on certain conditions.

Now, Peirce is busy reformulating the categories of his predecessors
in this categorical endeavor, in particualr Aristotle and Kant, that
is certainly true, but I do not think, given his previous employment
of them, that he would have so radically reversed their circumstance
or so summarily dismissed their application to the matter under view,
not without, for the sake of continuity in the transits of tradition,
affording his potential "community of interpreters" (COI) the grace
of a clear and explicit sign of the change that he may have in mind.

And so I think that it is moderately clear, in the absence of any such
a sign to the contrary, that Peirce is quite simply, if not purely and
innocently, taking it for granted that all of his qualified interpreters
are so comfortable and familiar with this passage via 'Peri Psyche', and
others like it, that they will hardly be aware of the quantum jump from
"Form As Actual Realization" (FAAR) to "Matter As Power" (MAP).  Anyway,
that is how I would read it, to wit, the matter of his text on the Form.
In short, he is presuming that his readers will assume the synthesis of
the living entelechy as the medium of its understanding, indeed, of any
form of understanding (episteme) at all.

I believe that this interpretation is supported by the next sentence,
where Peirce speaks of the form as being embodied in the Object:

| This form is really embodied in the object, meaning that
| the conditional relation which constitutes the form is
| true of the form or it is in the Object.

You may usefully compare this with the places where Aristotle
discusses the relation between body (soma) and soul (psyche).

]

Due to the importance of Aristotle's account
for every discussion that follows it, not to
mention for the many that follow it without
knowing it, and because the issues it raises
arise repeatedly throughout this work, I am
going to cite an extended extract from the
relevant text (Aristotle, 'Peri Psyche', 2.1),
breaking up the argument into a number of
individual premisses, stages, and examples.

Aristotle wrote:

a.  The theories of the soul (psyche)
    handed down by our predecessors have
    been sufficiently discussed;  now let
    us start afresh, as it were, and try to
    determine (diorisai) what the soul is,
    and what definition (logos) of it will
    be most comprehensive (koinotatos).

b.  We describe one class of existing things as
    substance (ousia), and this we subdivide into
    three:  (1) matter (hyle), which in itself is
    not an individual thing, (2) shape (morphe) or
    form (eidos), in virtue of which individuality
    is directly attributed, and (3) the compound
    of the two.

c.  Matter is potentiality (dynamis), while form is
    realization or actuality (entelecheia), and the
    word actuality is used in two senses, illustrated
    by the possession of knowledge (episteme) and the
    exercise of it (theorein).

d.  Bodies (somata) seem to be pre-eminently
    substances, and most particularly those
    which are of natural origin (physica),
    for these are the sources (archai)
    from which the rest are derived.

e.  But of natural bodies some have life (zoe)
    and some have not;  by life we mean the
    capacity for self-sustenance, growth,
    and decay.

f.  Every natural body (soma physikon), then,
    which possesses life must be substance, and
    substance of the compound type (synthete).

g.  But since it is a body of a definite kind, viz.,
    having life, the body (soma) cannot be soul (psyche),
    for the body is not something predicated of a subject,
    but rather is itself to be regarded as a subject,
    i.e., as matter.

h.  So the soul must be substance in the sense of being
    the form of a natural body, which potentially has life.
    And substance in this sense is actuality.

i.  The soul, then, is the actuality of the kind of body we
    have described.  But actuality has two senses, analogous
    to the possession of knowledge and the exercise of it.

j.  Clearly (phaneron), actuality in our present sense
    is analogous to the possession of knowledge;  for both
    sleep (hypnos) and waking (egregorsis) depend upon the
    presence of the soul, and waking is analogous to the
    exercise of knowledge, sleep to its possession (echein)
    but not its exercise (energein).

k.  Now in one and the same person the
    possession of knowledge comes first.

l.  The soul may therefore be defined as the first actuality
    of a natural body potentially possessing life;  and such
    will be any body which possesses organs (organikon).

m.  The parts of plants are organs too, though very
    simple ones:  e.g., the leaf protects the pericarp,
    and the pericarp protects the seed;  the roots are
    analogous to the mouth, for both these absorb food.

n.  If then one is to find a definition which will apply
    to every soul, it will be "the first actuality of
    a natural body possessed of organs".

o.  So one need no more ask (zetein) whether body and
    soul are one than whether the wax (keros) and the
    impression (schema) it receives are one, or in
    general whether the matter of each thing is
    the same as that of which it is the matter;
    for admitting that the terms unity and being
    are used in many senses, the paramount (kyrios)
    sense is that of actuality.

p.  We have, then, given a general definition
    of what the soul is:  it is substance in
    the sense of formula (logos), i.e., the
    essence of such-and-such a body.

q.  Suppose that an implement (organon), e.g. an axe,
    were a natural body;  the substance of the axe
    would be that which makes it an axe, and this
    would be its soul;  suppose this removed, and
    it would no longer be an axe, except equivocally.
    As it is, it remains an axe, because it is not of
    this kind of body that the soul is the essence or
    formula, but only of a certain kind of natural body
    which has in itself a principle of movement and rest.

r.  We must, however, investigate our definition
    in relation to the parts of the body.

s.  If the eye were a living creature, its soul would be
    its vision;  for this is the substance in the sense
    of formula of the eye.  But the eye is the matter
    of vision, and if vision fails there is no eye,
    except in an equivocal sense, as for instance
    a stone or painted eye.

t.  Now we must apply what we have found true of the part
    to the whole living body.  For the same relation must
    hold good of the whole of sensation to the whole sentient
    body qua sentient as obtains between their respective parts.

u.  That which has the capacity to live is not the body
    which has lost its soul, but that which possesses
    its soul;  so seed and fruit are potentially bodies
    of this kind.

v.  The waking state is actuality in the same sense as the
    cutting of the axe or the seeing of the eye, while the
    soul is actuality in the same sense as the faculty of
    the eye for seeing, or of the implement for doing its
    work.

w.  The body is that which exists potentially;  but just as
    the pupil and the faculty of seeing make an eye, so in
    the other case the soul and body make a living creature.

x.  It is quite clear, then, that neither the soul nor
    certain parts of it, if it has parts, can be separated
    from the body;  for in some cases the actuality belongs
    to the parts themselves.  Not but what there is nothing
    to prevent some parts being separated, because they are
    not actualities of any body.

y.  It is also uncertain (adelon) whether the soul as an
    actuality bears the same relation to the body as the
    sailor (ploter) to the ship (ploion).

z.  This must suffice as an attempt to determine
    in rough outline the nature of the soul.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~AUTO~CATALYST ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Here is a study aid to assist with the reading of
the text.  What I think is especially relevant to
our purposes -- aside from the content of these
fundamental categories or "basemental concepts"
that echo in the everyday constitutions of our
minds and still support, if a bit contingently,
the greater parts of our thinking even today --
is the method that Aristotle uses, working through
analogy and prototype, or the well-chosen example,
to articulate, build, construe, derive, and apply,
in a recursive process, his system of abstractions.

So consider the following "Alignments of Capacities"
as you read Aristotle's text:

---------------------------------------------------
       Matter       |            Form
---------------------------------------------------
    Potentiality    |          Actuality
    Receptivity     |  Possession  |   Exercise
       Life         |    Sleep     |    Waking
       Wax          |          Impression
       Axe          |    Edge      |   Cutting
       Eye          |   Vision     |    Seeing
       Body         |            Soul
---------------------------------------------------
       Ship?        |           Sailor?
---------------------------------------------------
