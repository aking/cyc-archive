Dear Chris M,

Thank you for this exposition. It is very enlightening.

I have a few questions.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm glad you posted this, because I have been puzzled by the 
&gt; &gt; &gt;difference between inference (provability) and entailment 
&gt; &gt; &gt;for some time.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Below you give the difference by:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  1. Provability:  p is said to be _provable_ from A in some
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     logical system L iff there are rules of inference that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     allow p to be derived by performing some operations on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     the statements of A to generate the statement p.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  2. Entailment:  p is said to be _semantically entailed_ by
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     A iff in any state of affairs (or universe of discourse,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     or possible world) for which all the statements of A are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     true, the statement p is also true.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Well I can see some difference, and that entailment should be
&gt; &gt; &gt;stronger, but I don't really understand the difference.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The basic point is that semantic entailment depends on the
&gt; &gt; subject matter, but provability depends on your choice of
&gt; &gt; notation for logic and the rules of inference associated with
&gt; &gt; it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Niggling point: entailment depends on notation as well, since it is
&gt; always some set of statements in some notation (some language) that
&gt; entails some other sentence in that notation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Provability can be defined in terms of the syntax of the notation,
&gt; &gt; but entailment depends on the semantics of whatever subject is under
&gt; &gt; consideration.
&gt; 
&gt; Right.  In a little more detail, a statement S is provable from a set
&gt; of statements M iff there is a proof of S from M, where such a proof
&gt; (in classical logic) is just a finite sequence of sentences S1, ...,
&gt; Sn, where each Si is either an axiom of the proof procedure, a member
&gt; of M, or is warranted by some rule of inference like Modus Ponens.  A
&gt; proof is thus a finite, purely syntactic object whose legitimacy can
&gt; be checked mechanically (assuming that there is a mechanical test for
&gt; membership in your set M).  Note that there is no notion of *meaning*
&gt; involved in the concept of a proof.
&gt; 
&gt; By contrast, S is entailed by M iff any interpretation of the language
&gt; of S and M that makes all of the members of M true also makes S true;
&gt; again, iff any way of assigning meanings to the nonlogical expressions
&gt; of S and the members of M that makes the members of M true also makes
&gt; S true.  Note that there is no notion of inference rules or mechanical
&gt; checking involved in the concept of entailment.  It is a purely
&gt; semantic notion.

MW: I'm still not quite there with entailment. Could you give an 
example please?
&gt; 
&gt; The concepts of provability and entailent are thus, conceptually,
&gt; completely different.  It is therefore a rather wondrous thing that
&gt; the two can be shown (by means of soundness and completeness proofs)
&gt; to match up exactly in first-order logic: M entails S iff S is
&gt; provable from M.

MW: Well that answers one question I had - why KIF has no concept of
entailment.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;Presumably there are cases where something can be proved through
&gt; &gt; &gt;inference, but is not entailed.  
&gt; 
&gt; Such a system would be useless in classical logic; soudness is a
&gt; minimum criterion that any classical system must meet, as the point of
&gt; a proof theory is to mirror entailment as far as possible.  As John
&gt; notes, there may be more flexible, nonclassical logics where this does
&gt; not hold.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; With his famous incompleteness theorem, Kurt Goedel proved that
&gt; &gt; higher-order logic is not complete:  there are true statements
&gt; &gt; of arithmetic that are not provable.  
&gt; 
&gt; Though this holds as much for first-order as for higher-order systems
&gt; of arithmetic.  Indeed, the incompleteness of higher-order logics can
&gt; be shown to follow from the incompleteness of first-order arithmetic.
&gt; But note that there are two quite different notions of completeness at
&gt; work here that it is important to distinguish.  John defined the
&gt; notion of the completeness of a *proof procedure* for a language
&gt; relative to some semantic theory for the language.  Goedel's notion of
&gt; completeness has to do with *theories* (i.e., sets of sentences is
&gt; some language).  Say that a theory T is *negation-complete* iff, for
&gt; any sentence S of the language of T, either S is provable from T or ~S
&gt; is provable from T.  What Goedel showed is that every attempt to
&gt; axiomatize arithmetic is bound to fail; any (decidable) set of axioms
&gt; in the language of arithmetic that you propose, i.e., any (decidable)
&gt; theory in that language, will either be inconsistent or will not be
&gt; negation-complete -- i.e., there will be some sentence S of the
&gt; language of arithmetic such that neither S nor ~S is provable from
&gt; your theory.  (Actually, this form of Goedel's theorem, due to Rosser,
&gt; is slightly stronger than Goedel's original theorem.)  Your theory
&gt; will, in particular, as John notes, fail to prove some sentence that
&gt; expresses a truth of arithmetic.

MW: Again, could you give an example please?
&gt; 
&gt; From this, the incompleteness of higher-order logic can be shown to
&gt; follow: there is no complete proof procedure for higher-order
&gt; languages.  

MW: Does this mean  that higher order languages depend on arithmetic?
If so why doesn't a first order language?

&gt; In particular, for any proposed proof procedure for a
&gt; higher-order language, there will always be sentences S of the
&gt; language that are logically valid (i.e., true in every interpretation
&gt; of the language) but which are not theorems (i.e., are not provable
&gt; from the axioms of the proof procedure).
