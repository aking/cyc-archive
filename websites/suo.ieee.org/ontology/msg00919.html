&gt; Occurents and continuants:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm certainly new at this, but I was becoming comfortable 
&gt; with the idea
&gt; that occurents depend necessarily on contintinuents  (my life 
&gt; depends on
&gt; me),
&gt; but that the continuents are not parts.  (I am not part of my life).

MW: Personally, I do not find the concepts of Continuant and Occurant
particularly helpful. I think that the discussions that Pat and Ian have
been having illustrate this. There are alternative view points, in
particular the 4D one where something is its 4D extent, then all this fuss
and confusion just goes away.

&gt; Mary's smile
&gt; depends on Mary, but isn't part of Mary.   

MW: That's interesting. What do you think Mary's smile is? The shape she
makes her face? or a feature of it (for some time)?

&gt; The stabbing of Ceasar is a
&gt; stabbing
&gt; (occurent) that depends on Ceasar, Brutus, and a certain knife, (all
&gt; continuants),
&gt; but these aren't  _parts_ of the specific stabbing.     This 
&gt; seems quite at
&gt; odds
&gt; with much of the continuant-occurent discussion I see.

MW: And there will occur continuous confusion because of the limitiations of
the concepts and their underlying world view.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been away most of January and February till now, so I've 
&gt; certainly not
&gt; read
&gt; everything in this thread, but the idea of an occurant being 
&gt; a _part_ of a
&gt; continuent
&gt; bothers me.  I'm not sure if this makes me a non-extensionist...

MW: You should worry, someone here accused me of being a nominalist :-(

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can I suggest that we have a name change?
&gt; &gt; Can we talk about something such as bodies and events rather than
&gt; &gt; continuants and occurrents?
&gt; &gt; Occurrent and continuant are products of a 3-D
&gt; &gt; (Endurantisist) perspective
&gt; &gt; on ontology - and, I suggest that we let the holders of this
&gt; &gt; view keep them
&gt; &gt; (Nicola Guarino is, of course, also keen on this view). Typically
&gt; &gt; continuants are regarded as being completely present at any
&gt; &gt; times at which
&gt; &gt; they exist (whatever that means) - and occurrents as being 
&gt; temporally
&gt; &gt; extended (as explained in my earlier attachment). So they are
&gt; &gt; necessarily
&gt; &gt; disjoint. This does not cause showstoppers. Nicola Guarino
&gt; &gt; has just been
&gt; &gt; explaining to me that an ocean wave and a flame are
&gt; &gt; occurrents composed of
&gt; &gt; (disjoint) continuant masses. Though as Pat suggests it may
&gt; &gt; be simpler to
&gt; &gt; regard these as one.
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate your objection to the Continuant/Occurrent 
&gt; terminology here,
&gt; but I think it would be wise if we didn't get hung up on the names of
&gt; concepts, at least not at this early juncture.  Names are, 
&gt; after all, only
&gt; names, and arguments about terminology could easily overshadow the
&gt; substantive issues of defining concepts and crafting axioms.  
&gt; They could
&gt; also make it harder for us to communicate, if people find it 
&gt; difficult to
&gt; keep track of the currently preferred term for a particular 
&gt; concept.  I
&gt; suggest that we let the names stand for the time being, and 
&gt; that if a term
&gt; is found to be really objectionable by a majority of SUO 
&gt; participants, we
&gt; make the change at the end of the ontology design process.  
&gt; Does this sound
&gt; reasonable?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ian suggests that "there is no overlap between ContinuantType and
&gt; &gt; OccurrentType. I think this needs clarification. If one is an
&gt; &gt; extensionalist, one would typically identify a thing with its
&gt; &gt; life (they
&gt; &gt; have exactly the same spatio-temporal (and modal) extension). So the
&gt; &gt; property of being a human life and being human would be the
&gt; &gt; same property
&gt; &gt; (as they have the same extension). So body-type and
&gt; &gt; event-type would not be
&gt; &gt; disjoint. However a non-extensionalist (such as an
&gt; &gt; endurantist) may prefer a
&gt; &gt; scheme where these were disjoint. It maybe useful if the SUO
&gt; &gt; strategy vis a
&gt; &gt; vis extensionalism were clarified (some baggage comes, of
&gt; &gt; course, with KIF).
&gt; 
&gt; This is a good point.  If we included 'Human' under 
&gt; 'ContinuantType' and
&gt; 'Human-Life' under 'OccurrentType' in the merged ontology, 
&gt; then we would
&gt; violate the disjointness condition on 
&gt; ContinuantType/OccurrentType, because
&gt; 'Human' and 'Human-Life' are co-extensional and we are assuming an
&gt; extensional interpretation of SUO-KIF.  I guess my response 
&gt; here would be
&gt; to
&gt; leave 'Human' under 'ContinuantType', to place 'Lifetime' (in 
&gt; the sense of
&gt; an organism's spacetime worm) under 'OccurrentType', and then to
&gt; compositionally create the concept of a human lifetime from these two
&gt; notions, e.g. the following:
