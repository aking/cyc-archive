&gt;Pat,
&gt;
&gt;You wrote:
&gt;Matthew, I think you could get continuants into a 4-d ontology by
&gt;thinking of them as a certain class of temporal cross-sections of a
&gt;4-d history. Given a history, consider the set of all spacelike (ie
&gt;perpendicular to the time-axis) 'slices' of it: that set always
&gt;exists, and it is 1:1 with the history but not identical to it. For
&gt;histories of continuants, the things in this set will 'be' the
&gt;continuant at the various times in its lifetime (to speak for a
&gt;moment in continuant-talk) ; for other histories they won't, of
&gt;course, but they might still be worth allowing to exist. The
&gt;characteristically 'continuing' nature of continuants, to which those
&gt;wedded to that way of thinking attach so much importance, may be
&gt;phrased in terms of what Nicola calls identity criteria on the things
&gt;in these slice-sets. For example, from the history (lifetime) of a
&gt;person, this would construct the (single) person at each moment in
&gt;that person's life. Each of these would 'be' that (single) person at
&gt;a particular time, so if we were to (re)construct a temporal or modal
&gt;logic by thinking of times - temporally possible worlds - as slices
&gt;through the 4-d universe, then these things would be the (individual)
&gt;continuant in each temporally possible world.
&gt;
&gt;This move would allow a 4-d ontology to accomodate
&gt;continuant/occurrent talk quite naturally, I believe, even though it
&gt;would not be a mapping that those who like that way of talking would
&gt;approve of.
&gt;
&gt;This is a neat way of starting to explain to Perdurantists what Endurantists
&gt;mean.
&gt;But the problem is that it is a local solution - not a global one.

I think it can be global strategy for finding entities on which both 
sides can agree, and which can be used to translate between them (in 
both directions).

&gt;It does not even begin to explain why some properties belong to sets of
&gt;time-slices (continuants) - e.g. being human - whereas others belong to
&gt;fusions of these time-slice - e.g. being a human life.
&gt;And why some things can be sliced into time-slices making continuants - like
&gt;humans - but others cannot - like football matches.

But Chris, now you are revealing your own endurantist prejudices, 
seems to me, In Matthew's 4d world , there is nothing here to 
explain. There is no distinction between being a human being and 
being a human life (except maybe in the sense that the former applies 
to timeslices and the latter to entire histories, but that 
distinction is easy to characterize). That very way of talking 
presumes the endurantist distinction between occurrents and 
continuants which the 4-d perspective resoundingly rejects; it is in 
direct violation of the principle of spatiotemporal extensionality. 
(What one CAN do is distinguish between what might be called 
continuant-style vs. occurrent-style history-slicing - spacelike 
slicing versus timelike slicing - but that is not a type distinction 
between kinds of 4-d entity.)
To a fully committed 4-d-er, being a continuant is simply an 
arbitrary property of some histories. Some histories are histories of 
continuants, others are not. Which are, and how can you tell? Only an 
endurantist would know for sure. It would be like asking a 
witch-doctor for a magic spell; you wouldn't expect to be able to 
know the reason; and it doesnt matter, because it has no ontological 
consequences in the 4-d framework.

For example, I can make a flicker-book set for a football match 
(occurrent), and I can locate things on each 'page' which can be 
strung together into smaller flicker-book sets, eg of one of the 
players in the match (continuant). I can do *exactly* the same thing 
to a flicker-book of me (continuant), and discover, say, a process of 
digestion going on in my stomach (occurrent). As I carve up into 
finer and finer flickerbooks (or histories) along spatial and 
temporal lines, continuants and occurrent come and go, inside one 
another like 4-d Russian dolls (a movement (O) of a leukocyte (C) as 
blood (C or O?) flows (O) along a vein (C)....). Seems to me that to, 
say, a biologist, this rapidly changing philosophical classification 
of some pieces into the C and some into the O (and others, just as 
interesting, into neither) is all rather irrelevant, and just gets in 
the way. It certainly doesnt seem like anything very *basic* or 
*important*. And, I might add, once you get into cell biochemistry 
(where I am right now in another incarnation), it really does 
seriously get in the way. Is a cell membrane a continuant or an 
occurrent? It depends on what kind of microscope you are using. Fact 
is, it is neither. You can't even classify it securely as either 
liquid or solid, or as either permeable or impermeable.

The actual criteria on which we base our everyday classifications of 
pieces of the world into enduring objects are many and varied. Some 
'objects' are systems in dynamic equilibrium; some are identified by 
being inside certain kinds of enclosing barriers; some are identified 
spatially, or by reference to behaviors of other systems, or by the 
way they reflect light, and so on. This system of individuation is 
elaborate and interconnected, and neither 'school' (perdurant or 
endurant) either denies its existence or has any magic way of stating 
it, so everyone has a lot of work to do. Just insisting on the 
presence of a binary distinction doesnt seem to me to be much of a 
head start, I must say.

&gt;I think the best lesson this can give us is that it shows that translation
&gt;rather than merging is a better strategy.
&gt;
&gt;And that we need to operate at a global level rather than a local one.
&gt;
&gt;These last two points are, of course, ones that you, Matthew and I have been
&gt;making for some time.

Agreed.

Pat
