Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.

It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat and John say - is not
sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as Matthew says - does
not seem to be ready for practical use.

It seems to me that - as it stands - the Ontology is not really a standard
that is fit for any practical purpose.

I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of making concrete
suggestions via email is adequate for the task at hand. A point that a
number of people have made in the past.

I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete suggestion for a way
to produce an adequate product. I think the task is of a size that anything
I would suggest would involve the old standards such as a project with
resources and a plan that gave some substance to the process of analysis to
be followed and the deliverables. But there is no point in starting this
unless there is some kind of commitment in terms of resources.

Regards,
Chris

John,
   Our work can only proceed by people making concrete suggestions about
how to reconcile, integrate and improve the content we're starting
with.  It's easy to say that any proposal is inadequate.  My hope is that
you and others with propose specific improvements.  Ian has done
considerably more than just merge sources into a common notation.
   Certainly, different ontologies may not have strong connections with one
another.  I don't believe that is required.  Every branch of a tree need
not be strongly connected to a large set of siblings.  The important
features I would say are that the branches are not inconsistent or
redundant.  I believe that has been achieved.  The tree may be considered
sparse or denuded, but that's to be expected at this early stage.

&gt;I endorse Pat Hayes' vote:

&gt; &gt;I vote NO.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Comments: I don't mean to denigrate Niles' hard work, but it is
&gt; &gt;ridiculously premature to adopt this (or anything else like this) as
&gt; &gt;a base document. This document doesnt even come close to the
&gt; &gt;requirement for a base document given in the accompanying text.
&gt;
&gt;I agree with Pat that Niles has done some hard work in putting
&gt;together the work of several other people whose efforts have
&gt;been merged (including some of my own).  But the act of
&gt;translating those independent collections of axioms into a
&gt;common notation does not cause them to be integrated.
&gt;
&gt;Pat continues:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;It has no overall coherent ontological model; it represents a melange
&gt; &gt;of conflicting and incommensurate views on many basic ontological issues.
&gt;
&gt;I agree with the first line above, but I disagree with the
&gt;second line that those collections are "conflicting".  On the
&gt;contrary, they are consistent with one another for the very
&gt;simple reason that they are unrelated to one another.  Whether
&gt;they become "conflicting and incommensurate" would depend on
&gt;how they are used together.  But the really hard work involves
&gt;determining how or when they could or should be used together.
&gt;
&gt;I agree with the general tenor of Pat's further criticisms,
&gt;but there is much more to be said about the details of the
&gt;issues involved:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Its axioms have no global coherence (for example: the
&gt; &gt;intended meaning of the quantifiers varies from one place to another
&gt; &gt;in the document; later axioms do not conform to the categories
&gt; &gt;introduced in the earlier axioms; many, if not most, of the major
&gt; &gt;classifications depend on questionable and controversial philosphical
&gt; &gt;presuppositions.) It fails to address many of the basic ontological
&gt; &gt;issues that ned to be got clear before we can put any ontology to
&gt; &gt;practical use (how to represent time and change, how to deal with
&gt; &gt;alternative courses of reality, for example. ) Moreover, it is clear
&gt; &gt;that the more 'pieces' are added to it, the more these problems are
&gt; &gt;going to get worse rather than better.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This methodology is fundamentally flawed. There is no way to achieve
&gt; &gt;a coherent ontology by 'merging' axioms from incommensurate
&gt; &gt;ontological perspectives in this simplistic way. It is rather like
&gt; &gt;trying to create a large piece of software by just adjoining pieces
&gt; &gt;of code written by different authors in different computer languages,
&gt; &gt;and expecting it to magically work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Apart from the general issues of a lack of a coherent methodology, I
&gt; &gt;have many particular problems with much of the actual content of the
&gt; &gt;document. As it stands, the ontology it outlines would be unworkable
&gt; &gt;for me for almost any practical purpose, even if it were globally
&gt; &gt;coherent. But this is not the right place to go into details.
&gt;
&gt;I believe that Pat and I agree on one fundamental point:
&gt;much more work is needed on the foundations and methodology.
