JA = Jon Awbrey
JC = John Collier
KK = Kirsty Kitto

JA: Once again, from a pragmatic perspective, Peircean style, logics are not
    autonomous systems, sui generis, laws unto themselves, but normative and
    speculative branches on the tree of semiotics, and thus, by Biblical and
    Shakespearean principles of &quot;measure for measure&quot;, subject to evaluation
    in accord with the objective that logic in general is conceived to serve.
    It is from this setting that one can judge a nonsense, or else be judged
    by evolution for failing to do so, and from this POV that one always had
    the axis, the fulcrum, the lever, and the moment of force that is needed
    to pivot through sundry degrees of freedom in one's selection of logical
    and semiotic systems.

JC: I am sympathetic to this view, inasmuch as I understand it.
    We are certainly getting more clear about where we differ,
    which is progress.  I still regard logic as transcendent,
    and would be very reluctant to give this up.

JA: I do not use the word &quot;transcendent&quot; in this context very much,
    but that is mostly because of conflicting claims from too many
    different directions.  But I think that a proper understanding
    of &quot;formal&quot;, in the sense of &quot;quasi-necessary&quot;, and a grokking
    of the ways that norms are defined in terms of limit processes,
    might just cover most of what is desirable in that inclination.

JC: It may be an article of faith for me, but it is a very small amount of faith
    in terms of the propositions one must accept.  The view you describe as Peirce's
    I would agree provides the meaning (in the sense of 'sense' or grasp) of logic,
    but not, I think its object (reference or being).

JA: It is the purpose of a sign relational framework to provide room for both reference and sense.
    Whether that room gets filled is another sort of question.  I gave you an example of a logical
    proposition that has empirical content, as any proposition that is successfully interpreted to
    describe an object reality does.  How does this propositional expression acquire that virtue?
    Much in the way that any sign does, because a &quot;community of interpretation&quot; (COI) uses it
    as a part of its &quot;try at objectivity&quot; (TAO) to describe a pragma of concern or interest
    to them.  That, plus all of the &quot;standard operating procedures&quot; (SOP's) that it takes
    to assay construct validity and to test intercoder reliability.  Standard stuff.
    While a certain sort worries about &quot;grounding symbols&quot; the world goes on using
    these symbols to get a grip on reality in just the way that it evolved to do.

JC: In particular, I am not convinced that sense exhausts meaning,
    which is my residual and pretty minimal rationalism speaking.
    I think that there are important things that one cannot
    represent fully.  But I have already said this.

JA: I cannot even imagine, after all this time, why you might think
    that a pragmatician would ever say that &quot;sense exhausts meaning&quot; --
    or why you think that there is a choice between empiricism and
    rationalism that is somehow implied by the pragmatic maxim.

JC: Well, I don't think that.  But I also don't agree with the notion
    that truth is an idealized limit.  I think we can experience aspects
    of truth directly.  Also with other values.  Nonetheless, I believe we
    can also be very, very wrong in any situation that involves judgement.
    Even in the ideal limit.

JA: We seem to be using the root words &quot;limit&quot; and &quot;norm&quot;
    at variance from each other -- surprise, surprise.

JC: I don't think so.  We believe different things about norms.
    Mine is the more inclusive belief, yours is more restrictive.
    I can include what you believe, but I believe there is more.
    That has been the basis of all of our disagreements so far
    as I can see.

So far your description of what you believe about norms
is limited to stating that it is less limited than mine.
If my norms may serve as lower bounds then I am content
to have them inform others of yours in this wise, but I
am sure that those who are thus informed would be happy
to receive some information just a bit more informative.

JA: When I say that &quot;X is a normative science of the form of conduct Y whose object is Z&quot;,
    I mean that &quot;X is a study of ways to do Y, with an eye to ways that one may attain Z&quot;.
    A normative science that arrogates itself to any degree of success will embody claims
    to have knowledge (Latin &quot;scientia&quot;) as to how one who aims for Z ought to conduct Y.
    These knowledge claims are often expressed in pieces of advice called &quot;heuristics&quot;,
    &quot;maxims&quot;, &quot;norms of conduct&quot;, &quot;precepts&quot;, and so on.  I recognize that there are
    those who would consider this to be a &quot;cheap utilitarian&quot; form of a norm, but
    it's my story and I'm sticking to it.

JC: So you block by my view by usage.  That is to set up a straw man.
    That is what I have claimed you have been doing all along.

I merely elaborate my own insights
so as to make my usage transparent.
I don't see your view yet, nor how
what I have writ here can block it.
I simply said that it was my story.
Who blocks you from relating yours?

JA: A normative science may have one or more descriptive sciences as components
    that contribute to it, but its aim, &quot;what it's for&quot;, is quite distinct.

JA: For example, Hertz gave us a description of &quot;How I Think&quot;,
    that may be more or less true as an account of its object,
    but suppose someone points to this description of conduct and
    recommends it as a universal ideal, a categorical imperative,
    or as a much more modest model for our emulation, as Howard
    has done, or as Kirsty did recently in these fine words:

KK: | To me Hertz's statement embodies the way a good
    | physicist should think about their enterprise.

JA: Then we have the normative use of a descriptive account.
    It is usually implicit in the recommendation of a norm
    like this that the recommender is assuming a particular
    ordering among the various forms of conduct that fall
    under review, to wit:

JA: Ideal &gt;&gt;&gt; Recommender &gt;&gt;&gt; Recommendees.

JA: That is to say, why recommend unless you think that
    your addressees are further from the ideal in the
    measure of their conduct than you yourself are?

JA: These are the orders of considerations that go into my speaking
    &quot;of the ways that norms are defined in terms of limit processes&quot;.
