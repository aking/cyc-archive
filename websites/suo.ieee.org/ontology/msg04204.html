Bill --

I'll take my response to John's characterization of, especially Whitehead,
offline, so as not to annoy you further.  However, I think you have taken
your annoyance a little too far in your note below.  Specifically with
respect to disease-producing agents, it is clearly important to understand
their nature.  Are they chemical agents that can be countered with specific
antidotes?  Or, are they living invaders, that will respond to treatment
that stops their processes by killing them, removing them from the
bloodstream, etc.

This is exactly on my point about the purpose of the observer, which
translates into perceived purpose of the system that is called out for
description, and ontologization.  I think one of the ongoing arguments in
this working group is about what we might call context-free ontology.  What
a lot of critics of SUMO seem to be saying is that a large collection of
concepts and statements about them (axioms, propositions, etc.) can only be
so helpful in addressing real issues of meaning in various domains of
interest.

This is why I have several times tried to stimulate discussion about what
contribution a standard ontology can make to the problem of context.  My
feeling grows stronger that the way to focus this in a valuable direction
would be to create a detailed ontology of the types of purpose that users
might bring to the problem of disambiguation.  In this way the standard
(upper?) ontology would provide the framework for users of ontologies to
find the more specific ontologies most suited to their particular purposes
for looking for ontologies.

Does that make any sense to you?

How much ontology can we get done without worrying about &quot;thirdnesses&quot;,
&quot;oscillations&quot;, &quot;goals&quot;, &quot;life&quot;, etc?  I bet a whole lot.

Lately all of this discussion of these kinds of things is a USDA Prime
example of why this group (modulo that done by the members working on
concrete projects) makes little progress as a whole.  It's not that these
topics are not interesting.  I suppose they are, and especially so if one
likes Peirce's philosophy.

However, there is a lot in the world that goes on without the sanction of
human knowers and can be ontologized without reference to human conceptual
or belief systems.

Take this whole bit whole bit about the amoeba, for instance.  Or, for that
matter, E coli.  If I get sick and die from E coli infection, frankly I
don't care about the teleological characterization of the status of this
little bug as a living thing.  What I care about are the toxins that it has
released into my bloodstream that are turning my organs to jelly.  In
brief,
I'm a lot more concerned about the biochemistry of this little beastie than
I am about it's status as a living being.

There are many such examples.  We can walk a very long way without taking
unnecessary strolls into the minefields that line the path.  Later on we
can
go back and clear the minefields.

From an industrial point of view, this is where the money will be for
ontology.  Use an ontology to cure one disease, predict one terrorist
incident, eliminate 1% of fraudulent claims for an insurance company and
we're golden.  Then we won't have to worry about justifying discussions
about &quot;thirdness&quot; and life.
