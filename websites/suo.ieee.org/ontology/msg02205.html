&gt; There are several issues getting confused here.
&gt;
&gt; One, there might be some things 'beyond the physical dynamic'
&gt; which need to be taken into consideration in describing the world.
&gt;
&gt; Two, there is an inherent need for ternary relations.
&gt;
&gt; These two issues have nothing to do with one another.
&gt; The first is deserving of long discussion, but the second,
&gt; taken at face value, is just plain wrong.  Anything that can
&gt; be said using n-ary relations can be said using only binary relations,
&gt; if the 'saying' is allowed to use the normal apparatus of modern logic,
&gt; ie in particular if it can use existential quantifiers and conjunction.
&gt; This in fact follows from Peirce's own argument for the irreducibility
&gt; of triadicity, ironically enough, since Peirce showed that anything
&gt; could be said using binary relations plus ternary identity;  but in
&gt; modern logic, ternary identity can be defined as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; TI(x,y,z) &lt;=&gt; (x=y &amp; y=z)
&gt; 
&gt; Now, one might have objections to this translation on various grounds (it
&gt; fails to provide an 'adequate analysis' (Awbrey), or it misses the essential
&gt; triadicity of the use of a name three times (Sowa), or it fails to 'cover'
&gt; identity properly, or whatever) but the fact remains, that it exists, and
&gt; it preserves truth.  And by so existing, it establishes the elementary fact
&gt; that, to repeat, anything that can be said using n-ary relations, can be
&gt; said using binary relations.  So it is pointless to simply *deny* this fact.
&gt; What might be worth doing is stating the thesis that you believe in more
&gt; carefully, so that it has a snowball's chance in hell of actually being true,
&gt; rather than simply reiterating a logical absurdity as though it were Holy writ.

Pat,

You continue to berate this idol of your own devising
and to burn this effigy of your own stuffing that has
nothing to do with Peirce's theorems about teridentity
or triadic irreducibility.  On the optimistic assumption
that you even care about the truth of this matter, which
is simply concerned with the mathematical structures of
relations in general, I will try another way to explain
what the underlying subject matter is, and why various
particular facts about it might be of interest to us.

You may think of it as one of those questions of mathematical minimalism,
like whether it's possible to "square the circle" or "trisect the angle",
but here is the essential catch, using just a straightedge and a compass.
It just so happens that 19th Century logicians, if not to mention Peirce,
would have taken it for granted that the form of "relational composition"
that Peirce called by the name of "relative multiplication", by grant of
its analogy with matrix multiplication, was the minimal operation in the
field, among other things, precisely because it did not invoke the usage
of what we now so blithely call a "truth-functional connective", not for
any lack of having such basic matériel lying around their workshops, nor
for their lack of understanding them and all their fundamental operating
characteristics, which comprehension, until a few instructive months ago,
I would have said approaches our own, but now I would have to express it
differently.  And I have to say that my own aesthetic sense is congruent.

All of this board-setting, all of these rules of the game,
was simply taken for granted by all players, except maybe
Schröder, by the end of the 19th Century.  The lion share
of what you have been saying all this time would be heard
by these people as somewhat analogous to insisting on the
circumstance that "the circle can be squared" through the
devices of some fancy French curve or panacean pantograph,
all of which was perfectly well-understood since the days
antecedent to "Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres ..."
via the device of some outlandish Gallic incursion by one
who had the gall to make the necessary incisions, but all
of that is neither here nor there in regard to the matter
at hand, of course, and in the end all that tyros of this
ilk can demonstrate is their failure to grasp the initial
statement of the problem.

There is more to say here, of course, but let me just try
to make one intermediate point about what this problem is.
When you travesty the topic of teridentity in this manner:

| TI(x,y,z) &lt;=&gt; (x=y &amp; y=z)

Now, I know that you are simply trying to parapharse the issue
in the manner to which you have accustomed yourself to view it,
but let me just try to suggest that the issue that is actually
at stake here has just about as little to do with the identity
among x, y, z as the problem of Hesperos and Phosphoros has to
do with the identity "Venus = Venus".  So the problematic link
is not that between the object x and the object z, but instead,
that between the token "y" in "x=y" and the token "y" in "y=z".

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
