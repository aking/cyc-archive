NTH SIG:

The best, the boldest, and the brightest bead -- or so I fancy --
that I would have to string on this thread would most likely be
this old idea that I came up with way back in the middle of the
1980's when I was taking a course in "applied" category theory,
combinatory logic, computational model theory, and lambda calculus
from John Gray at UIUC in Chambana.  It represents some of my best
thinking on the subject -- or so I think -- but I have not gotten
a chance to develop it very much, partly due to the fact that most
folks that I tell about it think that it sounds pretty far-fetched --
I know, you are shocked!

Anyway, I tried to roll it out once or twice before in the SUO Forum,
partly in response to some inquiries from David Whitten, but I think
that maybe it got lost in the shuffle somewhere -- we do seem to do
a whole lot of shuffling round here!

The easy way to re-start is just
to re-cite my old messages on it,
or else you could find them here:

&gt; In working on the next iteration of my proposal for a starter KB,
&gt; I have run into a question:
&gt; 
&gt; Which of the following formalizations (or both) does the group prefer?
&gt; 
&gt; FORMALIZATION ONE
&gt; We can have a predicate ARITY that relates the count of arguments ?COUNT
&gt; expected in any assertion with a particular relation ?RELATION.
&gt; ie: (ARITY ?RELATION ?COUNT)
&gt; 
&gt; We can have a predicate LENGTH that  relates the count of arguments ?COUNT
&gt; actually present in an assertion ?ASSERTION to that assertion.
&gt; ie: (LENGTH ?ASSERTION ?COUNT)
&gt; 
&gt; To be useful, COUNT would have to be a CLASS, with associated axioms.
&gt; This formalization will require definition of a numeric 'less than'
&gt; relation NUM-LT to be useful, and probably a numeric 'successor' relation
&gt; NUM-SUCC or function NUM-SUCC-FN.
&gt; 
&gt; FORMALIZATION TWO
&gt; 
&gt; We can have a predicate VALID-POSITION that relates a numeric position
&gt; ?POSITION to a particular relation ?RELATION stating that position is
&gt; valid for any assertion with a particular relation ?RELATION.
&gt; ie: (VALID-POSITION  ?RELATION ?POSITION)
&gt; 
&gt; We can have a predicate VALID-ARGUMENT-POSITION that relates a numeric
&gt; position ?POSITION to a particular assertion ?ASSERTION stating that
&gt; position is actually present in an assertion ?ASSERTION.
&gt; ie: (VALID-ARGUMENT-POSITION ?ASSERTION ?POSITION)
&gt; 
&gt; This formalization only requires that positions be numeric labels and
&gt; not be defined with a 'less than' or 'successor' relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any preferences between these two formalizations?
&gt; or is there a third one that should be considered?

David,

You may want to consider generalizing the concept of a relation
to ones that do not have a definite arity (or adicity) but that do
still have a "typing relation" (generalizing the signature function?)
that relates each "elementary relation" in the relation to its class
of compatible types.

For example, you can treat a whole formal language R,
a subset of A* for some finite (countable?) alphabet A,
as though its words were written like this:

   a1:a2:a3: ... :aj: ... :an

where n is the length of the word in question,
and you can treat these as the "elementary relations" of R,
working out the appropriate algebra of relations. 

This is an off-the-cuff remark, coming out of a memory of some work
that I began more than 20 years ago, and so I am a bit hazy on how
my last and best formulation of it worked out, or if it ever did,
so I will put off saying any more until I can find my old files.

David,

Sorry, I had to write that in a bit of hurry.
I will try to clear up the easier confusions
that I introduced, then hope to get to the
rest later, as I am still trying to learn
the set of languages that you folks use.

&gt; 
&gt; I am not familiar with the term "adicity" and don't know if it is
&gt; similar to my relation ARITY or LENGTH.

People who say "unary" (or "singulary" (Quine)), "binary", "ternary", etc.
usually say "arity", but then they run into the resulting confusion about
"binary" numerals, so some of them resort to calling these "dyadic" numerals.

People who say "monadic", "dyadic", "triadic", etc. say "adicity" on those
few occasions when they are being consistent, but mostly they defer to the
common usage.  Still, this prevents a clash with the names of numeral bases.

&gt; I expect what you are refering to as a "typing relation" is
&gt; the combination of the relations NTH-DOMAIN and NTH-SUBCLASS
&gt; in the first version of the structural ontology available at
&gt; <A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00448.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/logs/suo/msg00448.html</A>
&gt; If it is not, I would like to know.

Here is what I remember of the conceptual "construction kit"
that I used to generate these prospective generalizations.
I was trying to treat the logic of relations in the style
of category theory, on beyond binary (dyadic) relations,
which has already been done, more or less.  Also, if you
think about the analogies between extensional relations
and formal languages, as sets of that embody informational
constraints in the form of subsets of tupled or concatenated
elements, it turns out that they have a whole lot in common.
Except, with formal languages one loses the notion of arity.

In "category theory", if one has a "category" X, then one has a collection
of "arrows" Arr(X) and a collection of "objects" Obj(X), and a couple of
maps Source, Target : Arr(X) -&gt; Obj(X), and one writes "f : A -&gt; B" to
indicate that Source(f) = A and Target(f) = B.  Plus some other stuff.

| J. Lambek &amp; P.J. Scott, 'Introduction to Higher Order Categorical Logic',
| Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1986.

So if you try to imagine what a "relational arrow" R would look like,
it would have "j^th domain maps" Dom(j) : Arr(X) -&gt; Obj(X), and one
would write "R : A1 x ... x Ak" to indicate that Dom(j)(R) = Aj,
for j = 1 to k.

Now think about the composition of ordinary functional arrows,
and try to devise a fitting generalization for these new-fangled
relational arrows.

Well, composition is really a two-step operation, if you want to
parse it that way.  Suppose you are given f : A-&gt;B and g : B-&gt;C.
First you assemble the product of the domains, AxBxC.  Then you
put the constraint associated with f : AxB on the first two places
and the constraint associated with g : BxC on the last two places,
and then you take the projection on the first and last places.
(I often call this "Tarski's Trick", but it's probably ancient.)

So a suitable generalization of composition for relational arrows
involves you in doing stuff like this:  Write out a product domain
of interest, place the constraints of Rj on a specified subset of
places, for j in some J, then take various projections of interest.

Now, once you have taken the trouble to generalize everything this far,
then you get as an extra bonus the added utility of having all of these
same ideas work more or less the same way for formal languages, viewed
as sets of strings that satisfy collections of informational constraints.

&gt; I assume what you are calling an "elementary relation"
&gt; is any relation that relates entities that are in the
&gt; object language L0, if not, I don't know what would
&gt; make one relation more "elementary" than another.

Sorry, here I was just reverting to Peirce's 19th Century language.
An "elementary relation" is just the intensional name for a tuple,
that is, whatever it is that corresponds, for an intensional thinker,
to an "element of the relation".  All of these fine distinctions aside,
I usually just go ahead and identify elementary relations with n-tuples,
but here it saves me having to mention the "n" in a situation where all
of the fixed arities are no longer guaranteed.

&gt; &gt; For example, you can treat a whole formal language R,
&gt; &gt; a subset of A* for some finite (countable?) alphabet A,
&gt; &gt; as though its words were written like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   a1:a2:a3: ... :aj: ... :an
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; where n is the length of the word in question,
&gt; &gt; and you can treat these as the "elementary relations" of R,
&gt; &gt; working out the appropriate algebra of relations.
&gt; 
&gt; If this is what you mean by "elementary relation",
&gt; I have little experience in working with these,
&gt; and thus, do not have an clear idea how these
&gt; "elementary relations" will impact the creation
&gt; or content of the standard upper ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; David (whitten@lynx.eaze.net) (713) 791-1414 ext 6116

I have this stuff written out somewhere, more carefully --
and it does provide a useful framework for working with
the logics of relations and relative terms, at least,
when you know enough about the relations of interest,
and have enough concrete data on them, to treat them
in a combinatorial fashion -- so I will try to find it.
