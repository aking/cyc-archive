&gt; ============================================
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is perhaps worth remembering that this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion started with Graham saying that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; activities WERE relations, where as I was saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that we sometimes represented activities as relations,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where the relation really contains a number of things
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the activity is related to, including perhaps a reference
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to itself, but not other representation, which is not quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, really, I cannot be responsible
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the ways that other people talk!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  No, all we can do (and perhaps should do)
&gt; &gt; &gt; is note that some peoples usage is that:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes   a   in the real world
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can you give me a concrete example -- I still cannot think of one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here, just to try and speed things up, I can think of an example
&gt; &gt; where I was almost tempted to say something just a bit like this.
&gt; &gt; Let me remind you of the story that I told about A and B, where
&gt; &gt; each of these two "objects" in the real world -- well, alright,
&gt; &gt; my imaginary real world, but you know what I mean -- is also
&gt; &gt; an "interpreter" of certain signs, and so is associated with
&gt; &gt; a sign relation, portions of which I set down as follows,
&gt; &gt; under the names "R(A)" and "R(B)", respectively:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; | You can start out by imagining that two people,
&gt; &gt; | A and B, have a language that is restricted to
&gt; &gt; | just their own proper names, "A" and "B", plus the
&gt; &gt; | first and second person pronouns, "I" and "you",
&gt; &gt; | which will here be| schematized as "i" and "u",
&gt; &gt; | respectively.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | To specify a sign relation one has to give three domains,
&gt; &gt; | the Object, Sign, and Interpretant domains, schematized
&gt; &gt; | here as O, S, and I, respectively.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | For this example, let us consider the two sign relations,
&gt; &gt; | R(A) and R(B), corresponding to the usages of the two
&gt; &gt; | "interpreters", A and B, respectively.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | [ *** Note On New Notation ***
&gt; &gt; | |
&gt; &gt; | | I will use "in" for "element of" and "ç" for "subset of".
&gt; &gt; | ]
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | We have the following:
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | R(A), R(B)  ç  O x S x I,
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | O  =  {A, B},
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | S  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"},
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | I  =  {"A", "B", "i", "u"}.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | R(A) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "i", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "u", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | R(B) has the following eight triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt;:
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "A", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "u", "A"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;A, "u", "u"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "B", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "i", "B"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |   &lt;B, "i", "i"&gt;
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Following a usage of C.S. Peirce,
&gt; &gt; | the elements of a sign relation R, that is,
&gt; &gt; | the ordered triples of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; in R,
&gt; &gt; | are known as its "elementary sign relations".
&gt; &gt; | (This is roughly Peirce's meaning.)
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | [ *** Note On New References ***
&gt; &gt; | |
&gt; &gt; | | <A  HREF="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/suo/email/msg00729.html">http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/suo/email/msg00729.html</A>
&gt; &gt; | | <A  HREF="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/suo/email/msg01224.html">http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/suo/email/msg01224.html</A>

&gt; &gt; | ]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, it is very tempting to just go ahead and identify
&gt; &gt; the "objective interpreters" A and B with the portions
&gt; &gt; of sign relations that are indicated in an immediately
&gt; &gt; relevant context, and thus to write out the identities,
&gt; &gt; A = R(A) and B = R(B), or, to write it all out in full:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A  =  {&lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "A", "i"&gt;, &lt;A, "i", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "i", "i"&gt;,
&gt; &gt;        &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "B", "u"&gt;, &lt;B, "u", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "u", "u"&gt;}.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; B  =  {&lt;A, "A", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "A", "u"&gt;, &lt;A, "u", "A"&gt;, &lt;A, "u", "u"&gt;,
&gt; &gt;        &lt;B, "B", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "B", "i"&gt;, &lt;B, "i", "B"&gt;, &lt;B, "i", "i"&gt;}.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, we are treading on recursed ground here, or very nearly,
&gt; &gt; apparently defining A and B in terms of themselves, in a way
&gt; &gt; that would seem to lead to an infinite regress, so it seems.
&gt; &gt; Now, the situation is really not as bad as all that, not if
&gt; &gt; one is careful, and qualifies everything with due attention,
&gt; &gt; but still, it is probably a good idea to avoid this way of
&gt; &gt; expressing things if at all possible.  One way to stay out
&gt; &gt; of trouble and confusion is to maintain the distinctions
&gt; &gt; between A and R(A) and between B and R(B), respectfully.
&gt; &gt; Another way to do it is to "hedge the equal signs" that
&gt; &gt; appear just above, stipulating that they do not signify
&gt; &gt; literal identities but only mark relationships whereby
&gt; &gt; the ostensible definienda A and B are "represented by"
&gt; &gt; their "actions" on the surrogate definientia, that is,
&gt; &gt; the basic elements {A, B, "A", "B", "i", "u"} that go
&gt; &gt; to make up the triples, that go to make up the sets
&gt; &gt; of triples, that are the sign relations in question.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; MW: let me try something "real"
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;purchase, Carter's, lawnmower, Honda CB250,
&gt;  GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;

Well, I will not quibble, for now, about the "locus of reality" (LOR),
and which of our instances is nearer to it, but I am pretty sure that
you and I will have many myriads more occasions to use sign relations
that are isomorphic to those in the Story of A and B before we happen
next to think on the purchase of a new lawnmower -- at least it shall
fall out that way in my particular Nex Of Web, my clime of world, and
my time of the year -- but never mind all that now, back to your tale.

&gt; This is reasonably typical of what
&gt; you might find in a purchasing system.

Now, here -- here, now -- I find that I must quibble.
For what you say is what I understand well enough if
I grant you the grace of a poetic license (licence?),
but since we are striving to be just as picky in our
reading of the letter of the lore as we possibly can,
since we are straining to watch our P's and Q's even
as the moving finger sets them out in blackened writ,
well, then we must look to see if we can see what it
is that is really going on here, anyway, in, and for,
and all around and about the neighborhood of the new
transaction to which your currency is adverting here,
the one that lies behind, beneath, beyond all of our
many fine, but not so final signs.

So let us 'really' try to think about what is 'really' going on
in the database system, keeping mostly to the superficial level
of the software system, but not staying altogether oblivious to
what is going in the physical system that embodies the computer,
roughly analogous, if only through the sequence of by and large
historical accidents that we e-phemize as "incre-mental design",
to that species of biological system -- I did say "roughly"! --
that makes up our minds, so far as we know.

Let us say that you load up and initialize your favorite relational
database system -- I've got mine ready to go! -- and then you enter
the following sequence of signs into a relational database table of
the appropriate number of columns, breaking up the string as you go,
and parceling them out to the waiting table in the accustomary ways.

Here's the String, or a Token thereof:

"&lt;purchase, Carter's, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;"

Here's the Table, or an Image thereof:

I think that you may need to re-set the line length on your browser,
or this discussion will quickly descend into utterly unscansionable
chaos!  I will break for coffee and give you a while to do that ...

And besides, I have to go rummaging through my Attic
to see if I can locate my "Old Naive Realists'" hat --
yes, it's so old that it's really a helmet!  BaDaBoom!

By the way, my allusions to "going for the record"
were meant as a joke, not as a challenge! --
you appear to trying to catch up!
Give it up!

Cheers,

If Not Always From The Stands,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; It might be said to represent a purchasing activity.
&gt; However, you will note that there is no single element
&gt; in this tuple that represents that activity, only the
&gt; class of activity (purchase).  Similarly, there is no
&gt; object that is a surrogate for the actual lawnmower
&gt; purchased (e.g. its serial number), but only the type
&gt; of item bought (lawnmower) and the manufacturers model
&gt; (Honda CB250) and even this has the manufacturers name
&gt; bundled in.  Since this is an international lawnmower
&gt; shop, they have unusually given a unit of measure for
&gt; the price paid, and we have the date and time of the
&gt; purchase.  It is highly likely that there is only one
&gt; activity that all these elements relate to.  But the
&gt; question is, does this refer to an activity, or is it
&gt; just a relation of elements that are each related to
&gt; an activity and together uniquely identify it, but
&gt; is not a surrogate for the activity itself?  I would
&gt; argue that it is the latter, but custom and practice
&gt; means that many would accept it as the former.
