Thank you for clarifying,

exactly what is going on.

Jon,

	I have held off for a long time regarding the volume and nature of
your postings, but your less-than-professional (in my opinion) postings
(toward Adam) of late I cannot ignore.  I am an advocate for open lists,
which is the main reason I have not stepped in until now, but we need to do
something about your postings.  Too many people are complaining.

	As you are aware, you post a large volume of mail to this list and
you write in a manner that most find very difficult to read.  You also load
up your paragraphs with lots of personal feelings and other points that
contribute little.  The reason Adam has not responded to your postings is
that he has given up and now filters them. He never sees them, unless I
forward them to him.  If you want people to take you seriously, I suggest
you be short and to the point, and reduce the volume of  your postings by a
large measure.  

	I am asking you to substantially reduce the number of postings to
this list and to only post messages that contribute something to this
project.

Jim

Adam,

My note was addressed to Jim.  I try to accord people the respect
that they accord me, modulo the mistakes that all of us make from
time to time.  I am speaking as sincerely as I can afford to, and
I simply have no way of being certain what some people are up to
from their conduct, if it does not fit with models that I know,
and so there is a lot of guessing from imperfect data that one
has to do.  Many times you and Ian have signed off with the
conventional request for feedback, and I simply cannot say
it any other way than to say that these sorts of requests
no longer strike me as sincere.  Nobody has to take all
the advice that is offered them, of course, but I think
that I summarize the situation fairly accurately when
I say that even my most prosaic remarks about rather
cut and dried logical errors, even when reinforced by
other observers, have yet to be answered in any one
of the several ways that I would generally expect
from people who are genuinely concerned about
solving rather obvious problems.  These sorts
of communication gaps do engender mistrust.

One of the reasons that I have started to emphasize
the obstacle-identifying, problem-solving approach to
our mission is that the solution to a genuine problem,
one that is concurrently faced by the whole discipline,
is not the sort of thing that can be faked, talked around,
or worn down into submission, the way that a shakey accord
by way of political niceties of procedure, even the way that
ultimate compliance with a pro forma standard, can be rigged.
Consequently I think that facing up to genuine problems, the
kind that it benefits everybody to solve, in the long-run
at least, is one way to keep everybody honest, thereby to
encourage a sense of common purpose, and to direct the
majority of our considerable energies at something
beyond each other.  Just my current sense of it.

Yours Truly,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; I have to say this is quite unfair both in tone and in substance and
&gt; seems in conflict with your signature.  When anyone has pointed out
&gt; a specific criticism of the Merged Ontology, we've always and will
&gt; continue to do our best to provide specific and detailed response
&gt; either as to why we may disagree, or a clear statement of agreement
&gt; and intention to change the problematic content.  As to the contents
&gt; we've offered being at the level of high-school programming, that
&gt; doesn't to seem to me either an accurate or a constructive comment.
&gt; Plain speaking can be constructive, and need not be pejorative as
&gt; are the comments below.
&gt; 
&gt; Adam
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What do I mean?  Well, here's a typical sort of example:
&gt; &gt; Every now and again, Adam or Ian will trot out some bit
&gt; &gt; of a "Problem in KIF" for our exercise, like some proud
&gt; &gt; housecats dumping a near-vanquished mouse at our door.
&gt; &gt; They actually seem to have impressed themselves with
&gt; &gt; these miniscule productions.  But when two or three
&gt; &gt; people have pointed out the glaring blunders that
&gt; &gt; any high school programmer would be ashamed to
&gt; &gt; miss, well, they vanish without a word of
&gt; &gt; thanks, and with the general attitude of
&gt; &gt; "Well, who asked you, anywho!?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, I take this a mark of a certain type of person,
&gt; &gt; but I do not come to regard it as an ominous sign,
&gt; &gt; at least, not until I see you appearing, through
&gt; &gt; omission or otherwise, to collude in that spirit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, I am still a rank novice when it comes to plain speaking,
&gt; &gt; and so I hope that you will not take offense at the manner in
&gt; &gt; which I have stumbled to express my concerns.  I still have
&gt; &gt; the fullest confidence in the mission.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Respectfully Submitted,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
