&gt;&gt;...  In general I would like to see us
&gt;&gt;spending less time trying to convince each other of some particular
&gt;&gt;point of view, and more time working on how to reconcile multiple
&gt;&gt;points of view, through axioms (or whatever representation) that
&gt;&gt;articulate what is common, what needs to be differentiated, and for
&gt;&gt;what purpose.

Pat Hayes replied:

&gt;Ah, OK. What you are talking about here is what one might call a 
&gt;meta-ontology: a theory of ontologies, with information about their 
&gt;strengths and weaknesses, what they are good for, how they relate to 
&gt;one another, etc.. That is a noble ambition, but I don't think it is 
&gt;what the SUO is trying to be. The SUO  proposes to be a *single* 
&gt;upper-level ontological framework which reconciles all these various 
&gt;points of view into *one* classification heirarchy into which all 
&gt;other ontologies can be fitted. Which is one reason why many of us 
&gt;are very doubtful that it can be done.

I'm not sure what, if anything, "the SUO" has ever proposed.
In my KR book, I was pushing very hard for the infinite lattice
of theories and something like a "metalevel" for reasoning
about which one(s) is/are appropriate for any given problem.

&gt;.... Most of this information space hasnt 
&gt;even been explored or properly surveyed, let alone carved up.

Of course not.  The problem will keep growing as long as there
is more science left to be done.  (And I strongly disagree with
those people who think that science is coming to an end.)
That is the whole point of the Knowledge Soup chapter of my KR
book:  the lattice of all possible theories is open ended, and
you use metalevel reasoning to find which one is appropriate
to your problem.

&gt;Sorry if Im one of the old cynical guys, but Ive been doing this 
&gt;stuff for about 30 years now, as have many other people in AI, and it 
&gt;doesnt seem that anything dramatic has changed. Moores law has been 
&gt;going on for a while now, but that kind of advance doesnt make the 
&gt;representational issues any easier. Ian is still talking about the 
&gt;situation calculus (reference McCarthy 1961, or thereabouts), and 
&gt;others are still getting hyped about modal logics (references from 
&gt;mid-60s), so where are the new ideas coming from?

I'm even more cynical.  I don't think that there has been
much significant progress on fundamental conceptual frameworks
since Aristotle.  But that is one reason why I think that there
is some hope:  we don't really need any conceptual breakthroughs
in order to get something useful done.
