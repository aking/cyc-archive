&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have a rather broad view of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;what a state is, which interestingly includes activities. So
&gt; &gt; &gt; a state for us
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is any piece of space time where the time dimension is
&gt; &gt; &gt; non-zero (though it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;may be vanishingly small). The useful ones are those for 
&gt; which some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;predicate is true, e.g. being a person, being at 20C, being
&gt; &gt; &gt; a husband, being
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a football match etc. Some states are a temporal part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; others. So being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;husband is a temporal part of being a person. Being a
&gt; &gt; &gt; quarterback in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;particular footbal match is a temporal part of the football
&gt; &gt; &gt; match AND a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;temporal part of a person.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;MW: It really is possible to represent accurately quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; complex ideas with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;some very simple basic concepts - but this is what 4D is 
&gt; all about.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;MW: Oh the changes (timeless events) are the temporal
&gt; &gt; &gt; boundaries of states.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Purely temporal, or could they slope? eg think of a 
&gt; moving sprayer,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the spatiotemporal locus of where the water stops being under
&gt; &gt; &gt; high pressure.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: We have the concept of a stream which slopes. I think 
&gt; this would cover
&gt; &gt;this case, but I'm not sure what sense of moving you mean 
&gt; here, a rotary
&gt; &gt;sprayer, or a moving truck. I guess in either case a stream 
&gt; is part of it.
&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of a hosepipe with a sprayer at the end. Water passing 
&gt; through that point is undergoing a state change (pressure, velocity, 
&gt; etc.) which can itself be the subject of detailed analysis.  If 
&gt; someone is waving the hose around in order to spray a garden, say, 
&gt; then the locus of that water-state-change is moving in space, so it's 
&gt; not a purely temporal boundary (?)

MW: Well believe it or not, the research project for my first degree just
happened to be about looking at how a sheet of water coming out of a nozzle
broke up into droplets ...

MW: Well a sloping Space/time map certainly indicates movement, and this
points to a lot of consecutive events (or arguably a continuous event - but
I really think it's a lot of events you could treat as a continuouus event).

MW: generally what you do is divide the problem, look at the water relative
to the nozzle, and teh nozzle relative to say the earth, using different
coordinate systems. Generally it makes the calculations easier.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;MW: Quite. I would be inclined to say "A class of tuples",
&gt; &gt; &gt; but in KIF the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;relation stands as a predicate, and I have never quite got
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the bottom of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;whether predicate and class are synonyms (for which I 
&gt; find as yet no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;contrary evidence).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Strictly speaking a predicate (extension) on X is a set 
&gt; (= class) of
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1-tuples of members of X, rather than a set of members of X. To
&gt; &gt; &gt; identify these is a common abuse of notation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: I have seen different definitions of one tuples, one 
&gt; that said that a 1
&gt; &gt;tuple was the object it contained, the other that it was the 
&gt; singleton set
&gt; &gt;of the object it contained.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Do you have a view on that?
&gt; 
&gt; The latter is correct, but one often slurs the distinction as long as 
&gt; it doesn't cause confusion. Since it clearly has caused confusion on 
&gt; this list, I will try to be more careful here in future.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone insists that (not as a mere careless convention, but in 
&gt; fact) a 1-tuple or a singleton is the the object it contains, then 
&gt; denounce them as a closet mereologist and tell them to stop using 
&gt; set-theory talk.

MW: Well of course not being Irish, I couldn't put it quite like that. But I
would certainly point out the differences between classification
(non-transitive) and whole/part (transitive) and do things like ask them how
much they thought a class weighed.
