Jon,

A few comments:

&gt;&gt; Not at all!  Computers are much more methodical than any human being
&gt;&gt; could ever be.  When they apply a given grammar to a given sentence,
&gt;&gt; they exhaustively seek out every possible application of the rules.
&gt;
&gt;And that is just the sort of combinatorial gas
&gt;that dooms poor Tweety to death with a whimper --
&gt;or else we spelunkers will go out with a Boom!
&gt;
&gt;Yes, you Geeks, that's Boom Factorial =
&gt;(Boom)(Boom-1)(Boom-2) ... (3)(2)(1).

Actually, there are good ways to avoid the combinatorial
explosion.  The total number of possible ambiguities is
the product of all the individual places where there might
be a 2-way, 3-way, or sometimes more than 3-way ambiguity.

Instead of generating all possible combinations, it is easier
to make a note of each point where an ambiguity is possible.
Then the resolution of the ambiguities can be handled by
considering the sum of the possibilities rather than their
product.

&gt;....  It is, after all, my questionnaire, my design,
&gt;just one particular instrument that was constructed on the basis of the
&gt;theoretical principles that make some sense to me.  Anybody is entitled
&gt;to try and deconstruct its conceptual confounds and its cultural biases.
&gt;You would think that people interested in the project of disambiguation
&gt;would feel impelled at least to take these questions seriously, and the
&gt;fact that they never do just goes to convince me that they already know,
&gt;in their heart of ambivalved hearts, that this project is really futile.

Actually, I sympathize with you.  I wish it were possible
to ask people theoretical questions and get useful answers.
But linguists and psychologists have long ago discovered
that the answers are usually meaningless.  It is much more
fruitful to gather data when people are using language
(or behaving) in a completely natural way without a self-
conscious attempt to please or even second-guess the questioner.

&gt;But I am not the one who is saying that ambiguity can be eliminated.

I never claimed that.  I just said that metonymy and metaphor
are very powerful devices for adapting a limited vocabulary
to a potentially unlimited range of applications.  Sometimes,
ambiguities may result.  Sometimes those ambiguities are the
goal, as in puns, jokes, and poetry.  But more often than not,
those potential ambiguities can be resolved quite easily by
human listener/readers who have the background knowledge
assumed by a good speaker/writer.

&gt;I am merely trying to detail its structures in the few places I can.
&gt;If you are saying that you don't understand the questionaire, that
&gt;you share none of the nomenclature that went into it, then fine.
&gt;At least that would help me to explain some things.

Actually, the words are familiar to me, but judging from the
way you have been interpreting some of my usage, I'm not sure
whether I would interpret yours as you would intend.  If you
want to know how people use language, it would be much better
to look at what they say when they are engaged in normal
conversation.  When you ask people what they might say
in some hypothetical, usually artificial situation, the
results are unreliable.

John Sowa
