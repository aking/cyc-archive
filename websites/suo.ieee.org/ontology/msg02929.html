&gt; ATTN Voting Members of SUO WG,
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Please immediately acknowledge receipt of this email letter ballot.
&gt;    If I do not receive within 3-days, I will contact you again.  We want
&gt;    to make sure all voting members receive this ballot.  The wording of this
&gt;    ballot was developed and reviewed by the SUO Policies &amp; Procedures Subgroup.

Acknowledged.

&gt; 2. This message is to Ballot the question:
&gt; 
&gt; | Should the IEEE P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology Working Group commence work on the
&gt; | Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) version 1.15 [June 22, 2001] posted at:
&gt; |
&gt; | <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/Merge.txt">http://suo.ieee.org/Merge.txt</A>
&gt; |
&gt; | with the intent of developing it into the final SUO document?
&gt;
&gt; Note 1:  See background information below for more details.
&gt; Note 2:  This may be one of several candidate documents to be
&gt;          combined and aligned into the final SUO document via
&gt;          the consensus building process.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 3. By 15 Aug '01, please vote
&gt;    YES (comments optional),
&gt;    NO (comments required), or
&gt;    ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt;    Please send your votes and
&gt;    comments directly to me,
&gt;    but you are also free to
&gt;    post to the SUO list and
&gt;    openly discuss this topic.

I vote NO.

The proposed document exhibits a lack of acquaintance with
standard uses of standard terminology, a lack of knowledge
of the basic areas touched upon, from discrete mathematics
to logic to semiotics to topology, and an overall lack of
the scholarly attitudes and the intellectual competencies
that that would be required to amend these lacks.

Jon Awbrey

&gt; 4. This vote will pass if it receives a majority of YES vs. NO votes.
&gt;    ABSTAINS and non-votes are not counted in determining majority.
&gt;    The Chair may vote to make or break a tie.  As all voting members
&gt;    will have received and acknowledge receipt of this ballot and will
&gt;    therefore have an opportunity to vote, there will be no quorum of
&gt;    votes required for this motion to be determined.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Non-voting participants are welcome to express opinions
&gt;    and submit comments.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Background:
&gt; 
&gt;         a. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of consensus
&gt; we have for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need to
&gt; decide if we are going to go down this path or not.  A working group may
&gt; decide to work on more than one document.
&gt; 
&gt;         b. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose improvements
&gt; to the document, unless they are major enough for you to vote against
&gt; focusing work on this document.  However, such general improvement comments
&gt; are welcome and will be resolved (but not unless and until the vote passes,
&gt; since there would be no sense resolving comments if the group does not want
&gt; to proceed
&gt; with this document.
&gt; 
&gt;         c. If this vote passes, this document will change from being the
&gt; work (and under the control) of a group of individuals to being the work
&gt; (and under the control) of the SUO WG.  A Technical Editor will be appointed
&gt; or elected, who will incorporate WG-approved changes into the document.
&gt; This does not require frequent formal votes for every change.  A better
&gt; approach for daily or weekly updates is to develop consensus by resolving
&gt; objections, as we did when revising the Scope and Purpose.  In other words,
&gt; (1) the Technical Editor leads the discussion by processing the issues and
&gt; suggestions; (2) the issues/suggestions identify proposed additions, changes,
&gt; or deletions to the wording in the document; (3) the Technical Editor asks
&gt; the WG for any objections.  Items that do not have clear consensus would be
&gt; accumulated for later, more formal processing, i.e., the proposer of the
&gt; issue/suggestion is responsible for making a formal proposal (with a WG vote)
&gt; for the proposed change.
&gt; 
&gt; Jim Schoening
&gt; Chair, SUO WG
