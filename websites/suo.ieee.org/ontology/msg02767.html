&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ian --
&gt;    Your questions are quite reasonable, and I will give
&gt; some very brief comments which I hope clarify the 
&gt; points.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;    I have mentioned previously that the creation of an "abstract"
&gt; &gt; &gt; category as disjoint from "physical" at the highest level 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is in my view unnecessary and highly undesirable, since it
&gt; &gt; &gt; would preclude, for example, the creation of a general concept
&gt; &gt; &gt; "object" which subsumes both physical objects and 
&gt; abstract objects.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't follow you here.  The Merged Ontology does contain 
&gt; a general concept
&gt; &gt; that subsumes both Physical and Abstract.  This concept is Entity.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;    To be more specific: In the merged ontology, "physical" is defined 
&gt; (in the gloss) as an entity that has location in space-time.  But I
&gt; would 
&gt; like to create a more general concept of object, as something that has
&gt; a location in some (possibly abstract) space and that also 
&gt; has at least 
&gt; one attribute.  The physical objects, with location in the 
&gt; more specific 
&gt; space-time, would then be logically subclasses of the general "object"
&gt; class.
&gt; The point here is to distinguish an object and an attribute by the
&gt; relation between them.  The concepts of "object" and "attribute" are
&gt; probably best considered as primitives, and the relation that
&gt; distinguishes 
&gt; these primitives is, I believe, best defined at the highest level. 
&gt; Without
&gt; a general "object" that subsumes both abstract and physical objects,
&gt; this
&gt; more general relation cannot be created in one inheritable 
&gt; location, but
&gt; would
&gt; need to be duplicated for the abstract-object class and the
&gt; physical-object
&gt; class.  This isn't fatal, it is just unnecessary, more 
&gt; complicated, and
&gt; more difficult to maintain during changes, and I think, could make the
&gt; SUO more difficult to learn and use by not showing clearly 
&gt; the relation
&gt; of
&gt; physical objects and abstract object.  The same will be true for
&gt; processes, states, and events.
&gt;    I am uncertain how the definition of "physical" as being located 
&gt; in space-time affects the definitions of mental objects. (more
&gt; below on mental objects).

OK, I think I see what you're after now.  You want something like the
traditional philosophical distinction between substances and properties -
substances would have an independent existence, while properties would have
to "inhere", as they say, in a substance of some sort.  You claim that this
distinction will make the overall ontology simpler, because it will allow us
to avoid stating this distinction at two different spots in the ontology.  I
guess my response is that, if the distinction between substance and property
can be stated clearly and in a manner which can be inherited by both
Abstract and Physical, then we should do what you're suggesting.  I am
somewhat dubious, but I would be very interested in seeing the
taxonomy/axioms you develop on this basis.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There are other problems, such as if one wants to
&gt; &gt; &gt; define a space or time as a set (or at least as a collection),
&gt; &gt; &gt; it would be impossible in the above classification to consider 
&gt; &gt; &gt; either as a "physical" concept, even though space-time is as
&gt; &gt; &gt; physical as my hand, as I understand current theories
&gt; &gt; &gt; of cosmology.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't agree that the high-level distinction between 'Physical' and
&gt; &gt; 'Abstract' precludes the possibility of defining reasonable 
&gt; notions of space
&gt; &gt; and time.  In the Merged Ontology, 'TimeMeasure' is a subclass of
&gt; &gt; 'Quantity', which, in turn, is a subclass of 'Abstract'.  
&gt; 'TimeMeasure' is
&gt; &gt; subdivided into 'TimeMeasure-Position' and 'TimeMeasure-Duration'.
&gt; &gt; 'TimePoint' is a subclass of the former of these two classes, and
&gt; &gt; 'TimeInterval' is a subclass of both of them - intervals 
&gt; have both temporal
&gt; &gt; extent and location.  It seems to be that the concept of 
&gt; Space could be
&gt; &gt; cashed out in a similar way, viz. as some sort of 
&gt; specification of abstract
&gt; &gt; measures of the physical world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; One tactic is used by CYC, for example, where the concept
&gt; &gt; &gt; of "set or collection" is at a very high level, allowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; one to treat groups of physical objects to some extent
&gt; &gt; &gt; like sets, but also allowing purely mathematical sets 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be defined.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This concept of a set-like thing which has a position in 
&gt; space-time is
&gt; &gt; represented by the term 'Collection' in the Merged 
&gt; Ontology.  It is an
&gt; &gt; immediate subclass of 'Object'.  Note that something counts 
&gt; as an Object
&gt; &gt; just in case it has a position in space-time and it is 
&gt; relatively persistent
&gt; &gt; (I'm hoping that we'll eventually be able to cash out this notion of
&gt; &gt; persistent in a way that is acceptable to both 3D and 4D 
&gt; enthusiasts).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;    Yes, "collection" does serve the purpose of having physical
&gt; set-like classes, but does "set" then always have to be
&gt; mathematical?  I can envision collections that are neither
&gt; physical nor mathematical.  that's why I like the CYC
&gt; "#$SetOrCollection"
&gt; which can be either or neither physical nor mathematical.
&gt; The point here is to make the SUO as general as possible, that is to
&gt; allow everything that is not logically inconsistent, so as to
&gt; maximize its potential uility and wide adoption.

It seems to me that there are two notions of set.  One is an abstract object
which has no location in space-time, which has elements that can be
instances of either Abstract or Physical, and which has an identity that is
determined exclusively by its elements (if elements are added to or
subtracted from a set, the set is no longer the same set).  Some examples of
this sort of set are the set of real numbers, the set of registered voters
in the U.S., etc.  On the other notion of set, which is referred to as
Collection in the Merged Ontology, a set is comprised exclusively of
instances of Physical, has a location in space-time, and the identity of the
set can remain constant even when some members are added or subtracted.
Some examples of this sort of set are football teams and flocks of geese. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In the Merged Ontology, 'TimeMeasure' is a subclass of
&gt; &gt; 'Quantity', which, in turn, is a subclass of 'Abstract'.  
&gt; 'TimeMeasure' is
&gt; &gt; subdivided into 'TimeMeasure-Position' and 'TimeMeasure-Duration'.
&gt;    I do not fully understand the "units of measure" part of the
&gt; merged ontolgy.  I prefer to treat measurements as complex concepts
&gt; containing a quantifier and a dimensional unit.  The dimensional
&gt; unit may be a measurement of a physical entity or physical property, 
&gt; but the quantifier part should be more like a mathematical object.

The central concept in the "units of measure" part of the Merged Ontology is
MeasureFn, a binary function that assigns a specific quantity to a real
number and a unit of measure.  I'm not sure how a quantifier would be
relevant here. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;    An outline of an alternative top few levels could be, just for
&gt; &gt; &gt; illustation
&gt; &gt; &gt; (concepts with a preceding ** have multiple inheritance in
&gt; &gt; &gt; this short
&gt; &gt; &gt; classification):
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Entity
&gt; &gt; &gt;     Object
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Physical Object
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Ordinary Matter
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Solid Object
&gt; &gt; &gt;                    Rigid Object
&gt; &gt; &gt;                    **Powder
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Liquid Object
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Gaseous Object
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Semisolid Object
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Wouldn't it make more sense to abstract the qualities of 
&gt; 'Solid', 'Liquid',
&gt; &gt; 'Physical', 'Semisolid', and make them specifications of 
&gt; your category
&gt; &gt; 'Physical Quality' below?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;    Yes, but the attribute, e.g.  "solid" as a physical quality is
&gt; distinct 
&gt; from "Solid object", which is the specific concept listed in 
&gt; that point 
&gt; of the hierarchy.  One can, of course, manufacture ad hoc a concept
&gt; "solid object" by attributing the attribute "solid" to an 
&gt; "object", but
&gt; I 
&gt; think it is very useful to reify "solid object" as a class in itself. 
&gt; CYC 
&gt; does a lot with concepts that are in effect objects, even when it
&gt; discusses
&gt; suhstances such as glass. In CYC "glass" is actually some piece of
&gt; glass.
&gt; This differs from my own preference, which is to have a concept 
&gt; "substance" 
&gt; distinct from objects made of that substance, and this is one 
&gt; of the few 
&gt; points in CYC where I think there is something important missing.

I understand that you want to have two different concepts, one for the
substance/object and one for the attribute, but I guess the natural question
is:  How much does this distinction buy you?  Does it simplify the
construction of lower levels of the ontology or does it just build into the
ontology a distinction that goes back to Aristotle and may just be a product
of the fact that some natural languages distinguish nouns from adjectives?
Once again, though, I would be very interested in seeing what sort of
ontology results from taking your substance/attribute distinction as the
primary one.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;                    **Human being
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Electromagnetic Wave
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Plasma
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Condensed Matter
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Neutron Star
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Black Hole
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The preceding five terms deserve a spot in the Merged 
&gt; Ontology.  I'll try to
&gt; &gt; find a place for them there.  Any suggestions about where 
&gt; they might best
&gt; &gt; fit in?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Inanimate Object
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Artefact
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Mental Object
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd argue for steering away from 'Mental Object', 'Idea', 
&gt; and 'Purpose' as
&gt; &gt; high-level reified categories.  I don't think their meaning 
&gt; or usefulness is
&gt; &gt; clear, and there are good reasons to think that the concept 
&gt; of a mental
&gt; &gt; object is just an artifact of natural language.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;     I think it is very important to have "purpose" (in the sense of a
&gt; goal,
&gt; or objective as an  impetus to action) so that we can properly define
&gt; a "purposive agent", and make sense of human activities, which almost
&gt; always 
&gt; have some purpose.  If we leave it to domain-specific ontologies to
&gt; define "purpose" I fear that the foundation for commercial 
&gt; transactions
&gt; will be so vague as to lead to serious incompatibility between
&gt; systems left to their own definitions.

I agree that the notion of purpose is an important one, but I guess I resist
reifying it the way you have suggested.  In the Merged Ontology, we have two
relations 'hasPurpose' and 'hasPurposeForAgent', but rather than make
"Purposes" a special class of objects these relations simply require that
the purposive filler of these relations be a KIF-Formula.  To my way of
thinking, this is the most economical way to proceed, because it means one
less class in the ontology and it allows any proposition to be a purpose,
which reflects the way things are, I think.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Agent
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Physical Agent
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Purposive Agent
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure how 'Agent', 'Purposive Agent', and 'Cognitive 
&gt; Agent' differ
&gt; &gt; from one another.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;     A microbe can be a purposive agent, e.g. when it moves 
&gt; toward light
&gt; or nutrients, or metabolizes some chemical.  The "purpose" in 
&gt; this case 
&gt; was generated as a result of evolution, not of some neural 
&gt; information-processing event.
&gt;     A cognitive agent is tougher to define, because we have 
&gt; to set some 
&gt; arbitrary limit on the complexity of an information-processing process
&gt; to distinguish simple agents like a thermostat, which reacts to
&gt; temperature
&gt; by turning on or off a heating system, and more complicated cognitive
&gt; systems such as humans, or eventually (if we are successful) 
&gt; intelligent
&gt; robots.

I agree that a microbe might be be exhibiting agency when it moves toward a
light, but I don't think it is doing so when it is metabolizing something.
This is a tough area.  I guess I would argue that we should incorporate a
very generic notion of agency, e.g. acts autonomously, into the ontology and
then rely on other classes in the ontology to provide the sort of
distinctions in agency that you allude to. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;                    Microbe
&gt; &gt; &gt;                    Plant
&gt; &gt; &gt;                    Animal
&gt; &gt; &gt;                        **Mammal
&gt; &gt; &gt;                             **Human Being
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Inanimate Agent
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What would be an example of an 'Inanimate Agent'?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;    "a ball broke the window" or "the spilled acid ate a hole in the
&gt; carpet" or "the tornado blew the roof off my house".  The ball and 
&gt; acid and tornado are inanimate agents.  They do things to
&gt; other objects, acting as causal factors.

To my way of thinking, the ball would be an instrument of an agent which has
gone unmentioned.  I'm not sure what to say about the acid - that's an
interesting case.  As for the tornado, I agree.  Weather phenomena,
particularly catastrophic weather phenomena, can exhibit agency, at least of
the generic sort.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Idea
&gt; &gt; &gt;                Proposition
&gt; &gt; &gt;            Purpose
&gt; &gt; &gt;        Mathematical Object
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd also argue against a special category of 'Mathematical 
&gt; Object', since
&gt; &gt; the specifications you list here (excepting Number) are 
&gt; applicable to a wide
&gt; &gt; variety of objects.  For example, we can create the set of world
&gt; &gt; governments, we can define functions that map nations to 
&gt; their governments,
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;     The set of world governments may be a good example of a
&gt; "SetOrCollection" which
&gt; is neither physical nor mathematical.

I now realize that the set of world governments is a complex case.  The set
itself is, I think, an example of the abstract set I defined above (and
which is referred to as 'Set' in the Merged Ontology).  However, every
element of this set is, I think, an example of the space-time localized
sense of set (referred to as 'Collection' in the Merged Ontology).  For a
government is a group of people, and the government can remain the same even
if some members of the government step down. 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;     Relation
&gt; &gt; &gt;         Function
&gt; &gt; &gt;             Process
&gt; &gt; &gt;                 Physical Process
&gt; &gt; &gt;                     Mental Process
&gt; &gt; &gt;                         Communication
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The subhierarchy above seems a bit confusing to me.  'Process' is a
&gt; &gt; specification of 'Function'?  'Mental Process' is a specification of
&gt; &gt; 'Physical Process'?  'Communication' is a 'Mental Process'?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt;     Yes, as I view it this is the most economical way to generate
&gt; such concepts from more general ones.
&gt;    A physical process can be viewed as a function relating the state 
&gt; of a physical system as a function of time.  A more abstract 
&gt; generalization would be for a function to relate the state of *any* 
&gt; system to a generalized "progress" coordinate.  For example, the 
&gt; rotation of an idealized sectorized sphere might be plotted as 
&gt; the % of the western hemisphere visible from some vantage point as 
&gt; a function of the degrees of rotation.
&gt;    A mental process is listed here as a subclass of physical because 
&gt; I don't know of any mental process that takes place without some
&gt; physical change also occurring.  This may not be important, but it
&gt; makes sense to me.
&gt;    I guess it seems to be intuitively clear to me that communication
&gt; is a mental process, but I suppose that depends on what one
&gt; thinks "mental" means.   I think of communication as a transfer
&gt; of information between two thinking agents, and "thinking" is 
&gt; something that is mental, a process characteristic of a cognitive 
&gt; agent.  At this point I didn't think it was necessary to get 
&gt; into the question of the relation between process and event, which 
&gt; is fascinating and worth a few papers in itself.
&gt;    As I mentioned, it will take more time than I have available right 
&gt; now to provide a formal axiomatization and a (hopefully) convincing
&gt; argument for the utility of these distinctions, and I apologize 
&gt; for not taking more time to make my comments more concrete 
&gt; and detailed
&gt; at this time.  And I repeat my thanks for your efforts to make these
&gt; discussions more concrete and productive.

&gt;    I will, of course, try to answer specific questions as best I can.
