Dear Jim,

My other e-mail on this subject crossed with yours. I see we are
mostly along the same lines.

See comments below.

&gt; To: Standard-Upper-Ontology (E-mail)
&gt; Subject: SUO: Some proposed rules and interpretations 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Since we may have some votes coming up, let's see if we 
&gt; agree on how
&gt; Robert's Rules of Order should apply to email votes.  The 
&gt; interpretations I
&gt; have always seen include:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  The concept of 'quorum' does not apply to email votes, 
&gt; since everyone
&gt; (or at least far more than half) can be presumed to have 
&gt; received email
&gt; notification of the vote.   Another way to view this is as a 'letter
&gt; ballot,' for quick a 'quorum' does not apply (because they are sent to
&gt; everyone).     I believe this is the widely accepted practice 
&gt; for email
&gt; groups.  Comment?

MW: I agree. I have suggested dealing with this by having a
reasonable period (1 week) within which everyone (or at least
the vast majority) can be expected to have the opportunity to
vote.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. ABSTAINS are not counted in determining the outcome of a 
&gt; vote.  What
&gt; counts is the ratio of YES to No votes.  

MW: Yes, this is normal practice, and I further suggest that
failing to vote is counted an abstention.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. I believe we should require more than one 'second' to 
&gt; conduct a vote.  A
&gt; vote in a physical meeting can take 15 seconds, but via email 
&gt; it can take
&gt; weeks. I suggest the level of support should be about half as 
&gt; many votes as
&gt; would be needed for that position to prevail.  I have 
&gt; previously posted a
&gt; complicated formula for determining this number, but I'm now 
&gt; thinking we
&gt; should just pick a number (about 5)  and change it later if the groups
&gt; wants.    The clause might (this is not yet a motion) read, 
&gt; "A total of 5
&gt; voting members must support a motion or amendment before it 
&gt; can be brought
&gt; to a vote."    

MW: I don't really understand the issue here. Personally I am quite
happy with 1 second. But 5 is not unreasonable and is acceptable to me.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  In the past, we have made many minor decisions without 
&gt; voting, by the
&gt; Chair saying, "Does anyone object to ..."  Once we have some 
&gt; documents in
&gt; development, the Technical Editors will also need to determine rough
&gt; consensus without taking numerous votes.    Under RRO, as Bob 
&gt; has educated
&gt; us, a single objection forces a vote.  I believer a greater 
&gt; number should be
&gt; required and suggest about 5.  The clause might read, "The Chair or
&gt; Technical Editor may determine consensus by asking if there are any
&gt; objections to a motion, proposal, or position.  If 5 or more 
&gt; object, the
&gt; item is not accepted."  
&gt; Comments?  

MW: I think this is the wrong process to operate. In ISO TC184/SC4 we
operate a process of Project and Editorial ownership of material by 
those taking the lead for a particular deliverable. The project team
is the final arbiter of the content of the document they propose. This
gives a better chance of internal consistency, and slightly reduces the
chance of a camel. This point is important, since we are dealing with
a body, a consistent whole ontology, not individual axioms that can
be just thrown together.

The deliverable is published in draft form from time to time, and 
participants are invited to vote on the draft. The options are:

Abstain
Yes
Yes with comments
No with comments

Yes with comments implies that the comments are minor or editorial,
and that they could be ignored at the discretion of the project team.

No with comments means that the document is not considered fit for
purpose, and that at least the major issues identified need to be 
appropriately addressed before it could be considered fit for purpose.

In general an issue has been satisfactorily addressed when the raiser 
of the issue agrees it has been.

The issues raised are formally logged, and resolutions prepared and
incorporated into a new draft for a new vote.

At some point you hopefully find that most issues that can be resolved 
have been, and you move to a final vote to give the document some sort 
of approved status.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments.
