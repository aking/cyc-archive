PLG.  Discussion Note 3

PC = Patrick Coppock

PC: This is an interesting thread, quite apart from the Rorty connection.

PC: In fact, if you look, Peirce makes quite a lot of literary and poetical
    references in his philosophical writings, especially quotes from Shakespeare
    (Hamlet, The Tempest, Henry IV, Merchant of Venice, Midsummer Night's Dream ...),
    Horace, Emerson, Lucretius, Pope, Fulke Greville, John Davies, Tennyson, Dickens,
    Poe, Amhurst, Philp Sydney, Lewis Caroll, William Cullen Bryant, Mark Twain, Cowper,
    to name but a few that I turned up in fifteen minutes from the footnotes to the
    Essential Peirce (2)

PC: Do you happen to know of anyone who has done
    any systematic work on this before?

PC: Exactly when, where, and how he used each one (as allegory,
    to illustrate a point, etc.), would be fascinating to see
    some kind of overview of ...

No, I don't know of such a work -- sounds like the work of a lifetime, though!
Of course, trying to figure out the purpose of a particular allusion is often
as difficult as trying to fathom the sense of the original quotation.  While
I have him in mind, Freud is another one who was especially keen on choosing
just the right poetic kenning for his epigraphs and illustrations, and there
have been many who said, cutting uncouthly, that he never said it as well as
the Bard said it before him.  Still, the more prosaic interpretation of that
whereof Shakespeare dreamt does have its uses, however particulate it may be.

On of the more sly aims that I had in mentioning and/or using Quine --
you should know that I have a strange fondness for his work, as he was
certainly one of the more interesting writers on logic around when I was
an undergraduate, often precisely for the &quot;poetic&quot; quality of his essays
that made him the object of many a tsk!tsk! from my philosophy professors --
but more to the present point, his preaching of &quot;holism&quot;.  If I criticize
him more roundly now, it is probably in part my disappointment that he was
not as consistent about his holism as he was about his 2-2-stolid 2-adicism.

For instance, let us con-template this statement:

| The dogma of reductionism survives
| in the supposition that each statement,
| taken in isolation from its fellows, can
| admit of confirmation or infirmation at all.
| My countersuggestion, issuing essentially from
| Carnap's doctrine of the physical world in the
| 'Aufbau', is that our statements about the
| external world face the tribunal of sense
| experience not individually but only as
| a corporate body.

What if we were to expand the (implicit) scope
of its uses of &quot;statement&quot; from something like
&quot;all statements in theory T&quot; to something like
&quot;all statements in culture C&quot;?

What if we take our holotext at whole cloth?
