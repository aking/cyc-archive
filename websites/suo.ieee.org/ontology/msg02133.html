&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Lee,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since I do not view your position as philosophically or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logically adequate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the full range of human experience, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: I note this. What I lack is evidence or proof that your view is
&gt; &gt; &gt; correct. If you can identify where the position is inadequate and
&gt; &gt; &gt; which ranges of human experience it does not apply to then we might
&gt; &gt; &gt; make progress.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There was a Polish philosopher named Tadeusz Kotarbinski who took
&gt; &gt; something like your position to great lengths.  He variously 
&gt; &gt; called his
&gt; &gt; position reism, pan-somatism, concretism, semantic reism. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I'm not familiar with this person, but I support his approach of
&gt; taking things to great lengths. This way you see if it breaks, and
&gt; where, and then you know the limitations.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Tarski, insofar
&gt; &gt; as he bothered to work out a metaphysical position, acknowledged
&gt; &gt; Kotarbinski as his master and his early and famous work on 
&gt; &gt; truth in formal
&gt; &gt; systems is couched to make place for a reist approach.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I once spent a good bit of effort to show how this position, 
&gt; &gt; which is not
&gt; &gt; my own, can be stretched to cover just about anything, 
&gt; &gt; including ethics
&gt; &gt; and aesthetics. But it has one great limitation that may have 
&gt; &gt; some bearing
&gt; &gt; on an SUO effort.  It covers experience after the fact, after the
&gt; &gt; experience has become manifest in some spatio-temporal phenomenon.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This is no longer true when you introduce a possible worlds
&gt; approach which allows you to consider possible futures, either
&gt; hypothetical or intended, as well as possible pasts, which may be 
&gt; linked to or detatched from the present.

Not quite right, since the notion of a possible world (that is,
possibilities made manifest in a hypothetical spatio-temporal ensemble)
and (to use Kotarbinski's early contribution to possible world semantics)
of an "empty name" as what computer people might call a 'wild card'
standing for such a world is something short of the philosophical category
of modality.  Modality in its best developed sense is the notion of
possibility detached from (or better, prescinded from) time and space.  
The view you espouse is workable but more limited; in it possibility is
postulated to be always conjoined with some space-time instantiation
(which may be placed hypothetically in the past, present or future) rather
than seen a fundamental category in its own right.  Possible worlds theory
is certainly an advance over the attempt to absorb possibility into
potentiality, but it is a step short of a view of multiple, indeed,
infinite possibilia for each and every sign.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; thus sees little point in asserting experience, human or 
&gt; &gt; otherwise, as a
&gt; &gt; broader category than empiria.  Thus in your recent exchange 
&gt; &gt; on 'giving'
&gt; &gt; with Chris Menzel, you cover giving after an act of giving has become
&gt; &gt; manifest, while Chris would like to assert some ternary aspect to the
&gt; &gt; logic of giving, or in natural language to the dative case, 
&gt; &gt; whether or not
&gt; &gt; it is made manifest in an activity.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You can express as many aspects to giving as you wish. Whether you
&gt; use binary or ternary relations is largely a matter of how you want to
&gt; view things, not what you are viewing.

If your distinction between the 'how' and the 'what' of the view of giving
is designed to highlight the issue of meaning, then I agree.  If I see two
people grasping an object and releasing it from one to the other, that, I
take it, is the 'what' you are referring to.  Viewing this 'what' as an
act of giving is the 'how' I might view it.  Similarly, two people
emitting sounds at each other and responding mutually in body language in
a kind of dance of the eyes, gestures and facial expressions, is a 'what'.  
Viewing this as a "conversation" is a 'how'.  If this captures what you
have in mind, then my argument is that a 'how' that captures the
meaningfulness of the act to the actors requires some tertium quid beyond
the physical dynamic.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now I would not argue that you fail to 'cover' giving, since you can
&gt; &gt; provide a verbal account of each and every instance after it 
&gt; &gt; occurs, and
&gt; &gt; once an act has occurred to every 'extension' of it in the 
&gt; &gt; sense you use
&gt; &gt; this term, but I would argue that there is something about 
&gt; &gt; the logic of
&gt; &gt; the dative case that is missing in your view of it. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Our model can deal with an arbitrary number of things involved
&gt; with giving. We simply choose to represent them in a binary form
&gt; (from a KIF point of view). It can then from this base of information
&gt; support views that might be ternary or what ever is wished for.
&gt; 

Yes, I agree: your key term here is "support views".  What is actually
happening is that the ternary view is added by the user, who is supplying
the element of interpretation that the binary structure leaves out. It is
the user's "view" that is being "supported."

&gt; &gt; And I 
&gt; &gt; would also argue
&gt; &gt; what is missing in the binary view of giving is also missing 
&gt; &gt; in the binary
&gt; &gt; treatment of other concepts crucial to an account of human 
&gt; &gt; institutions,
&gt; &gt; including the institution of science.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Some examples rather than assertions would be really helpful.

See the addition of conversation above, which may be generalized to the
example of language as such, and on the micro-level to the example of
representation as such.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; With respect to a computational ontology to be used in 
&gt; &gt; conjunction with a
&gt; &gt; relational database, my argument may make no practical 
&gt; &gt; difference so long
&gt; &gt; as we are interested in using the ontology to search and mine what has
&gt; &gt; already been achieved and certified in some sense as 
&gt; &gt; information.  But to
&gt; &gt; the extent that we may wish to use an ontological artifact 
&gt; &gt; for sciences of
&gt; &gt; discovery or for deliberation, which contain a purely 
&gt; &gt; hypothetical or even
&gt; &gt; imaginative element, and in which we wish to be especially alert to
&gt; &gt; emergent categories and to the repurposing and reconceptualizing of
&gt; &gt; information for unanticipated needs, we may want to provide
&gt; &gt; architectonically for a position that concedes a degree of reality to
&gt; &gt; concepts without grounding them dogmatically in some 'concrete'
&gt; &gt; manifestation and its extensions. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: As stated above all this is supported through the possible worlds
&gt; approach we incorrporate, as stated above.

And as replied above, the possible worlds approach still contains the
concretist grounding but attempts to correct its obvious limitations by
detaching it from the actual world to hypothetical worlds and
quasi-worlds. Within a certain range this will 'work'.

 &gt; 
&gt; MW: Also think about how likely it is that I would be able to have a 
&gt; position that was not capable of lookihng forwards as well as backwards.
&gt; Shell is one of the most successful companies in the world, and has been
&gt; continuously for about 100 years. One of the reasons for this is its 
&gt; expertise in planning ... What chance would I have internally if I 
&gt; couldn't support that?
&gt; &gt; 

Shell is certainly a great and successful company, which has had to
combine economic, financial, geopolitical, legal, personnel, engineering
and scientific considerations, among others.  It is a complex world in
itself and anything that works within it shows good prospect of working
internally for other modern institutions constructed along similar lines.

But 100 years is not a very impressive span of time in these matters. If
Shell exists as a distinct institution 100 years from now, there is no
guarantee that it will be animated by a mode of thought based on the years
1901-2001.


&gt; &gt; I am, of course, able to participate cheerfully in an 
&gt; &gt; ontology constructed
&gt; &gt; on principles in the general family to which your position belongs, so
&gt; &gt; long as the purpose of the effort is clarified to be limited 
&gt; &gt; to uses for
&gt; &gt; which this position is appropriate.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: One reason I am pursuing this discussion is that if there really
&gt; are things it cannot handle, I would really like to know.

The key is how far one can rely on the shared language and mutual
recognition of purposes of a collection of users to supply the missing
interpretative element.  To the extent one can rely on a *community* of
users, much can be left tacit, and we need not provide architectonically
for computational elements that community members can supply better on
their own.  But giving some computational form to the tertium quid will
prove increasingly relevant to the extent that we wish to automate
mutually untranslatble patterns of interpretation and orientation and to
embody them in agent protocols.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But if, as in our current effort,
&gt; &gt; there is strong resistance to narrowing the purpose, 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I do not wish to rule out other view points. If you read up on the 
&gt; IIDEAS architecture you will see that I think it is important to be 
&gt; able to support a range of different viewpoints for different purposes,
&gt; but that also I want a view that is able to support/integrate all of them
&gt; (if possible - I recognise that it may not be).
&gt; 

I was not referring to any resistance on your part-- to the contrary, you
have been by my lights a very reasonable voice on this issue-- but to the
persistent failure of those in greater control of this process to show an
openness to the repeated requests from many other participants for greater
clarity in purpose and attendant methodology.

&gt; &gt; I would 
&gt; &gt; counsel that
&gt; &gt; what I would regard as a more capacious and open-ended view 
&gt; &gt; not be ruled
&gt; &gt; out prematurely.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: And what would that be?
&gt; 

Though this is not really an email topic, let me try a quick, somewhat
fanciful example.

Suppose we drew a line and cut it at an arbitrary point, and at the cut
there exploded an infinity of possibilities not only for resolving the
point into a continuum of infinitesimals, but for the 'how' (in your
sense) of viewing each infinitesimal.  Is it useful to construe one as
opposed to another infinitesimal variation as defining a distinct
'possible world'?  Or would we want a less inflated vocabulary for
handling these variations?

Best,

Lee
