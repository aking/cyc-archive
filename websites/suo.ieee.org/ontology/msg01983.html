&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; Your quotation from Hugh T. is very helpful, because it
&gt; illustrates a universal principle of natural languages:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; | It is worth noting in this connexion that the use of the words
&gt; &gt; | 'oros' (bound or limit), 'akron' (extreme), and 'meson' (middle) to
&gt; &gt; | describe the terms, and of 'diastema' (interval) as an alternative
&gt; &gt; | to 'protasis' or premiss, suggests that Aristotle was accustomed to
&gt; &gt; | employ some form of blackboard diagram, as it were, for the purpose
&gt; &gt; | of illustration.  A premiss was probably represented by a line joining
&gt; &gt; | the letters chosen to stand for the terms.   How quality and quantity
&gt; &gt; | were indicated can only be conjectured.
&gt; &gt; |
&gt; &gt; | Hugh Tredennick,
&gt; &gt; | "Introduction" to Aristotle's "Prior Analytics", page 184 in:
&gt; &gt; | 'Aristotle, Volume 1', Translated by H.P. Cooke &amp; H. Tredennick,
&gt; &gt; | Loeb Classical Library, William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.
&gt; 
&gt; This example illustrates a kind of "metonomy", which refers to
&gt; something by using a term (often more concrete or "diagrammatic")
&gt; to refer to something abstract.  This usage is common not only in
&gt; ordinary language, but also in the most formal of all sciences,
&gt; mathematics.  We use terms like "limit", "boundary", or "interval"
&gt; to refer to numbers, which are the entities denoted by numerals.
&gt; In fact, it is very rare for mathematicians to mention the
&gt; distinction between numbers and numerals explicitly, unless
&gt; they are talking about the actual syntax of decimal, binary,
&gt; or other representation.

Let me think.

Metonomy = "use of the name of one thing for that of another
of which it is the attribute or with which it is associated --
as in 'lands belonging to the crown'" (Webster's).

Accordingly, in this figure of metonymy, the term "crown" denotes
what the term "regent" denotes by virtue of the fact that a crown
is an associate or an attribute of a regent.

Apparently, we have a sign relation of the following form,
in which the figure of metonymy is embodied by the triples
of the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; in the lower four rows of the table:

¤~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~¤
| Object   |  Sign    | Interp   |
¤~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~¤
|          |          |          |
| Crown    | "Crown"  | "Crown"  |
|          |          |          |
| Regent   | "Crown"  | "Crown"  |
| Regent   | "Crown"  | "Regent" |
| Regent   | "Regent" | "Crown"  |
| Regent   | "Regent" | "Regent" |
¤~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~¤

This may be diagrammed as follows, with denotative arcs
extending from signs to objects and with connotative arcs
extending from signs to interpretant signs:

  Crown  = o1 &lt;----- s1 = "Crown"
                   / ^
                  /  |
                 /   |
                /    |
               v     v
  Regent = o2 &lt;----- s2 = "Regent"

The projection of this sign relation on its SI-space forms an
equivalence relation, a "semiotic equivalence relation" (SER),
on the signs "Crown" and "Regent".  However, this SER does not
constitute a "referential equivalence relation" (RER), because
the parts of the associated partition of the syntactic domain,
the union of S &amp; I, do not faithfully represent the structure
of the object domain O.

&gt; I would interpret Aristotle's use of diagrammatic terms in
&gt; the same way I would interpret the use of the word "top"
&gt; to refer to the most general category of the ontology:
&gt; it refers explicitly to the place where the mark occurs
&gt; on the paper or blackboard, by metonomy to the word instance
&gt; written in that place, by further metonomy to the word type,
&gt; and by further metonomy to the concept expressed by that word.
&gt; 
&gt; In programming languages, a related term is "coercion", which
&gt; refers to the automatic type conversion that takes place when
&gt; necessary:
&gt; 
&gt;   - Integer to float:  In the expression, "2 + 3.75",
&gt;     the integer value of the numeral "2" is automatically
&gt;     converted (or "coerced") to float.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Character string to numeric:  In some languages,
&gt;     arithmetic can be performed directly on numbers that
&gt;     are represented by character strings.  In "2.6 + '55'"
&gt;     the string '55' is coerced to the integer 55, which is
&gt;     then coerced to the floating-point value.
&gt; 
&gt; Metonomy in natural language is extremely common and,
&gt; I would say, extremely valuable in general.  And I admit
&gt; that it can sometimes cause confusion.  But I would much
&gt; rather take advantage of metonomy in what I read, write,
&gt; and speak than to force myself and others to insert
&gt; "conversion" operators for every change of type.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line:  I am willing to say "By 'top', I mean
&gt; the concept expressed by the mark that occurs at the
&gt; top of the type lattice."  But I'm only going to say
&gt; that once.  From then on, I would just say "top".
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ...  The more pertinent question,
&gt; &gt; from the standpoint of a pragmatic theory of signs is:
&gt; &gt; "Exactly what roles does the given thing play within
&gt; &gt; a given moment (= elementary relation = triple) of
&gt; &gt; the relevant sign relation?"  So, of course, signs
&gt; &gt; can be objects -- no sooner do we talk about them
&gt; &gt; than they become objects of discussion, if others
&gt; &gt; would say "potential objects" (PO's), reserving
&gt; &gt; the honorific title "object" for the PO of some
&gt; &gt; consistent style of discussion and predication.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, such analysis can be valuable.  But once the analysis
&gt; has been done, I would go back to using language the way it
&gt; has always been used:  take advantage of metonomy whenever
&gt; it makes the expression more concise.

Sadly, until our computers get to understand the way we talk,
with all of these figures of speech, metaphor, metonymy, and
many more, somebody will have to do the dirty job of getting
them to grok it.
