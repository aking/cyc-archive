HP = Howard Pattee
JA = Jon Awbrey

HP: It is impossible to evaluate your quite general and
    somewhat vague proposal without specific discussion
    of how your ideas would differ from the vast existing
    works on the subject.  For example, you ask:

JA: Do all the varieties of inquiry have something in common, a structure or
    a function that defines the essence of inquiry itself?  I will say &quot;yes&quot;.
    One advantage of this answer is that it brings the topic of inquiry within
    human scope, and also within my capacity to research. 

HP: Just saying &quot;yes&quot; because it's &quot;one advantage&quot; gives me
    no confidence in your approach.  Believe him or not, at
    least Simon gives empirical evidence for this conclusion:
    &quot;... the processes used to create interesting and valuable
    novelty are basically the same in whatever field we observe them.&quot;
    [Simon, H. A. &quot;Creativity in the arts and sciences&quot; Kenyon Review 23, 2,
    Spring 2001, pp. 203-220.  His extensive evidence is in many places, e.g.,
    Qin, Y. and H. A. Simon, &quot;Laboratory replication of scientific discovery
    processes, Cognitive Science 14, 281-312, 1990.]

Howard, that was merely a rhetorical device for informally introducing
a regulative principle.  It is little more than the auto-permission to
ask a question, in hopes of finding an answer, or the reason why not.
It is not a conclusion and does not say, or even guess yet, what the
commonality might be.  At this point in my introductory foray, I am
more concerned with how to begin than what the conclusion will be.

JA: The stages of work just described will gradually lead me to introduce the
    concept of an &quot;inquiry driven system&quot;.  In rough terms, this type of system
    is designed to integrate the functions of data-driven adaptive systems and
    rule-driven intelligent systems.  The idea is to have a system whose adaptive
    transformations are determined, not by learning from observations alone nor by
    reasoning from concepts alone, but by the interactions between these two sources
    of knowledge.  A system that combines different contributions to its knowledge base,
    much less the mixed modes of empirical and rational types of knowledge, will find
    that its next problem lies in reconciling the mismatches between these sources.
    Thus, we arrive at the concept of an adaptive knowledge-base whose changes over
    time are driven by the differences that it encounters between what is observed
    in data and what is predicted by laws.  This sounds, at the proper theoretical
    distance, like an echo of the error-controlled cybernetic system, moreover, it
    falls into line with classic descriptions of scientific inquiry. 

HP: I find no idea here that is not well-known.

I consider that the principal advantage of my approach.
It was a struggle to avoid being original, but I pride
quite literally in finally having finally achieved it.

HP: Not only is it an echo, but these approaches have been
    successfully implemented in computer programs, both
    logic-based, adaptive network-based, GA-based, and
    many combinations thereof.

Yes, I have implemented two or three myself.
My own evaluation of their level of success,
of my own and others, is a bit more nuanced.

HP: Before we take seriously your further cautions and promotion of Peircian logics
    I think you need to be more specific about what has been done (with some references),
    what has not been done, and the reasoning that leads you to expect to do better, or
    at least differently.

The major logical systems that we actually use today all derive from Peirce,
as anyone who has looked into the historical background of it will tell you.

My literature review when I wrote this initial essay was 22 pages long,
much of it admittedly general purpose, and most likely familiar to you,
but I did spend the 80's at 4 different universities doing grad studies
in math, psychology, and computer science, and I kept up with the lit
in AI up until the time when it fell into a loop and started to repeat
itself &quot;apparently interminably&quot; (AI -- ain't that always the rub!?),

The principal novelty of my approach is the degree and the extent
of its &quot;derivativeness&quot;, to wit, that I am working to integrate
such a large and familiar diversity of perspectives that are
often taken in contrast or even in exclusive opposition to
each other, for instance, &quot;empirical&quot; versus &quot;rational&quot;,
extensional versus intensional, dynamic versus symbolic,
qualitative versus quantitative, &amp; several other versus.

Jon Awbrey
