Dear Colleagues,

Sorry if I caused confusion with my previous note. I started
writing a specific proposal, and ended up concluding we needed
a process first. so this section:

&gt; Below is a resolution that is what you are formally asked to 
&gt; vote on. Before it is an introduction that provides background
&gt; material to the resolution.

had no resolution below. It should have read:

A resolution is what you are formally asked to 
vote on. Before it is an introduction that provides background
material to the resolution.

There may be other artefacts of my original intent I have not 
spotted.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; From: West, Matthew MR SSI-GREA-UK 
&gt; Sent: 24 May 2001 09:14
&gt; To: Standard-Upper-Ontology (E-mail)
&gt; Subject: SUO: Resolution Process
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; 
&gt; Introduction
&gt; 
&gt; You will be aware that Jim has been asking several of us if we
&gt; will propose specific pieces of work to be a focus of activity
&gt; for the SUO group, and I am one of the people he has approached.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is that we might adopt a number of work items which
&gt; members of the SUO may choose to contribute to. This implies
&gt; formally accepting them as work items within the SUO work group.
&gt; 
&gt; Since we don't have much practise of doing things formally here
&gt; I am going to start by proposing the process I think we should
&gt; adopt. It is a straight copy of what we do in ISO TC184/SC4, and
&gt; is probably based on Roberts' Rules.
&gt; 
&gt; Below is a resolution that is what you are formally asked to 
&gt; vote on. Before it is an introduction that provides background
&gt; material to the resolution. The introduction does not form part
&gt; of the resolution. To proceed the resolution requires a second.
&gt; If/when a second is found, then the resolution is open for 
&gt; discussion. Comments may be made about the appropriateness of
&gt; the resolution and changes may be suggested. The proposer has 
&gt; the absolute right to accept or reject any proposed changes
&gt; (it is their resolution). If there have been no negative
&gt; comments, then the chair may seek to pass the resolution by
&gt; acclamation (silence is consent). Otherwise you move to a vote.
&gt; A simple majority of those voting for over those voting against
&gt; (abstentions don't count) is sufficient to pass the resolution.
&gt; 
&gt; Since we are an e-mail community the principle issue is timing.
&gt; Especially since members may not be "present" at all times.
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest that a minimum of 1 week is allowed for discussion,
&gt; after which the proposer may call for a vote at any time at 
&gt; their discretion. I suggest that 1 week is allowed for votes
&gt; to be made by voting members, and that non-votes (silence) is
&gt; taken as abstention. Votes may either be to the chair or the
&gt; list as individuals prefer.
&gt; 
&gt; I know some people here are suspicious of any degree of 
&gt; formality in what we do, so I think it is worth noting that 
&gt; a resolution represents the position of the group as a whole. 
&gt; The group has no power over its members and no decision of the 
&gt; group can require any action of any individual. Resolutions
&gt; usually offer approval, or encouragement for certain actions
&gt; that are proposed, approval of deliverables for certain 
&gt; purposes, or agreeing to follow certain procedures in how
&gt; we conduct our business. (If what I have done here goes
&gt; beyond elucidating what Roberts' Rules says anyway, then
&gt; the subject of this note could well be the basis of a 
&gt; resolution in this last category.)
&gt; 
&gt; Regards  
&gt;       Matthew
