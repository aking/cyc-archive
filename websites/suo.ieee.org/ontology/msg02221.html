Dear Chris,

Thank you again for tidying up my misunderstandings.

You seem to have leapt ahead of me with what I was originally
proposing as just an example. But you still leave us short of
the final destination.

&gt; (forall (?x ?y ?z)
&gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (gives ?x ?y ?z)
&gt;              (exists (?e) 
&gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt;                                   (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
&gt;                                            (giver ?e' ?x)
&gt;                                            (receiver ?e' ?y)
&gt;                                            (given ?e' ?z))
&gt;                                       (= ?e ?e')))))))
&gt; 

MW: The next step is to move from a ternary relation to an n-ary
relation ... Is that possible?

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;            (giver x John)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;            (receiver x Mary)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;            (given x book1)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       )
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  )
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This can't be right, as the free variable "x" occurs on the right
&gt; &gt; &gt; side of the &lt;=&gt; but not on the left; it just sits there like a
&gt; &gt; &gt; pronoun with no associated context to give it meaning.   
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: x is intended here to be a constant. It is relevant to 
&gt; just this one 
&gt; &gt; act of giving. Though I would agree it is a bad choice of name.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I'm even more confused.  Is your intention to introduce 
&gt; a distinct
&gt; variable C for every three names N1, N2, and N3 in your language and
&gt; then provide an axiom of the form
&gt; 
&gt; (&lt;=&gt; (gives N1 N2 N3)
&gt;      (and (giving C)
&gt;           (giver C N1)
&gt;           (receiver C N2)
&gt;           (given C N3)
&gt; 
&gt; for all such C, N1, N2, and N3?  That seems very awkward indeed.  What
&gt; does such a C denote if the thing denoted by N1 does not give 
&gt; the thing
&gt; denoted by N2 the thing denoted by N3?  A nonexistent event?  A merely
&gt; possible event?  I really don't think this is what you want to do.  I
&gt; think what you want is to guarantee a giving event *whenever* three
&gt; things stand in the gives relation.  That has to be stated generally
&gt; with a quantifier as I suggest below, not with constants, which force
&gt; you to find something for them to denote.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, you are using "gives" ambiguously here. If I recall 
&gt; another of
&gt; &gt; &gt; your recent posts correctly, you are using "(gives x)" to mean
&gt; &gt; &gt; something like "x is a giving", i.e., an act or event of giving.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: You are quite right. The two gives have different meanings. In
&gt; &gt; a later version I have used gives1 and gives2 (or some such) to
&gt; &gt; distinguish them.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll stick with "giving" to apply to events.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If so, I think what you're after is the following (I change to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; more mnemonic (and KIF'ish) variable "?e"):
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary book1)
&gt; &gt; &gt;      (exists (?e) 
&gt; &gt; &gt;              (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt;                   (giver ?e John)
&gt; &gt; &gt;                   (receiver ?e Mary)
&gt; &gt; &gt;                   (given ?e book1))))
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Well no, as I said in my response to Fred it is necessary to
&gt; &gt; ensure that there is exactly one e for this case, which is probably
&gt; &gt; best denoted by a constant. 
&gt; 
&gt; Except that using a constant doesn't do a thing to guarantee 
&gt; uniqueness
&gt; (at least, not without adding an ungainly bunch of "unique 
&gt; names" axioms
&gt; -- unique naming might be a convenient constraint to implement in a
&gt; database perhaps, but it is unlovely, to say the least, in a formal
&gt; ontology).  Nothing you've said would rule out there being another
&gt; constant denoting an event distint from your original in which John is
&gt; giver, Mary receiver, and book1 the given. If you want 
&gt; uniqueness, then
&gt; you do that by means of quantififiers as well, supplementing the above
&gt; as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary book1)
&gt;      (exists (?e) 
&gt;              (and (giving ?e)
&gt;                   (giver ?e John)
&gt;                   (receiver ?e Mary)
&gt;                   (given ?e book1)
&gt;                   (forall (?e')
&gt;                           (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
&gt;                                    (giver ?e' John)
&gt;                                    (receiver ?e' Mary)
&gt;                                    (given ?e' book1))
&gt;                               (= ?e ?e'))))))
&gt;                      
&gt; If it now turns out that (gives John Mary book1), then you 
&gt; are warranted
&gt; by the above in *introducing* a new name, which will denote the unique
&gt; event that is guaranteed by the above axiom.  But should John 
&gt; *not* give
&gt; book1 to Mary, then, again by the above, there is no corresponding
&gt; event in which John is giver, etc (and no embarrassing constant around
&gt; seeking a nonexistent denotation).  Of course, I think what 
&gt; you *really* 
&gt; want is the purely generalized form of this axiom, of which the above 
&gt; is just an instance:
&gt; 
&gt; (forall (?x ?y ?z)
&gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (gives ?x ?y ?z)
&gt;              (exists (?e) 
&gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt;                                   (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
&gt;                                            (giver ?e' ?x)
&gt;                                            (receiver ?e' ?y)
&gt;                                            (given ?e' ?z))
&gt;                                       (= ?e ?e')))))))
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; What all this means for the triadicity debate I have no idea, as I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have no idea what triadicity in the Mystical Peircean Sense is all
&gt; &gt; &gt; about.  I would understand the above axiom as nothing more than a
&gt; &gt; &gt; way of providing a (perhaps) more robust analysis of the giving
&gt; &gt; &gt; relation by enlarging one's ontology to include events.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: You make a good point here ...
&gt; 
&gt; Then I'll quit while I'm ahead!  :-)
