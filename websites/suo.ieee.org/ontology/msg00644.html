&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew, your answer below is rather longer than I expected.  
&gt; To precis my
&gt; understanding of your POV.
&gt; 
&gt; 0. A spatio-temporal object is something in the real world, and can be
&gt; represented by a constant.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. A spatio-temporal extent is something in the real world, and is
&gt; different from a spatio-temporal object.

MW: I must have been sloppy here. spatio-temporal extent == spatio-temporal
object
&gt; 
&gt; 2. An activity is something in the real world.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. An activity is a spatio-temporal extent
&gt; 
&gt; 4. A relation is a representation (and therefore not in the real world
&gt; unless you are qualified to study advanced topics)

MW: Actually not even then. But representations of them might.
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  Activities can be modeled as relations.  The example is 
&gt; modelled as
&gt; multiple dyadic and triadic relations.

MW: Yes, but it is preferred (by me at least) for an activity to be modelled
as a constant, which then participates in a number of relations, as I set
out, where these relations indicate those things which play a role in the
activity.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Attempting to model a activities as a single n-adic relation may be
&gt; adequate for some purposes, but is inadequate for intercommunication
&gt; between systems, and by implication for the SUO.

MW: Yes
&gt; 
&gt; How am I doing so far?

MW: Pretty good.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours, Martin

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; I note this is just us. If that is an accident feel free to post this
&gt; thread.
&gt; 
&gt; I try to be careful to match representation form to what they 
&gt; represent, so
&gt; I recognise a spatio-temporal object as something that first 
&gt; exists in the
&gt; real world, and second has a consistent representation in the 
&gt; information
&gt; world, so as a constant such as a, b, c, fred, etc. A spatio-temporal
&gt; analysis of activities in the real world reveals them to be 
&gt; spatio-temporal
&gt; extents. They consist of the temporal parts of the objects 
&gt; that are playing
&gt; a role in the activity. Thus I expect them to be represented as
&gt; spatio-temporal objects, i.e. by a constant, as above.
&gt; 
&gt; Actual relationships exist in the same way that actual 
&gt; classes do. They are
&gt; abstract objects that are out there that we can take an 
&gt; interest in and use
&gt; to organise and think about the world. Actual relationships 
&gt; are what one
&gt; thing has to do with another. I note that a relation like:
&gt; &lt;purchase, lawnmower, Honda CB250, GBP, 500, 12:15 12th August 1999&gt;
&gt; does not represent a relationship, but actually a number of 
&gt; relationships
&gt; that each element of this construct has to an object that is 
&gt; not part of,
&gt; but may be inferred from this construct.
&gt; 
&gt; So in analysis I look for recognition of this. I would 
&gt; analyse the above
&gt; into:
&gt; &lt;Purchase a&gt;
&gt; &lt;Purchaseof a b&gt;
&gt; &lt;Datetimeof a 12:15-12th-August-1999&gt;
&gt; &lt;lawnmower b&gt;
&gt; &lt;HondaCB250 b&gt;
&gt; &lt;hasprice HondaCB250 c&gt;
&gt; &lt;GBPvaluemap c 500&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Or something similar. So I have extracted and represented the actual
&gt; relationships.
&gt; 
&gt; Not that there is anything wrong with the original data structure in a
&gt; purchasing system, but you do have to extract what it means 
&gt; if you are to
&gt; make that available without everyone having to learn the 
&gt; language of every
&gt; other system.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this provide an answer?
&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matthew, recently you very usefully challenged me about 
&gt; whether I was
&gt; &gt; talking about the real world or representation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Below you say inter alia "I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent". and then "activities are frequently
&gt; &gt; modelled as
&gt; &gt; relations".  I think it would help many of us if could you
&gt; &gt; clarify your
&gt; &gt; view for each of activity, relation, and spatio-temporal
&gt; &gt; extent, which you
&gt; &gt; regard as being in the real world, and which are
&gt; &gt; representations used for
&gt; &gt; modelling?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dear John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This doesn't help us much. In particular it doesn;t answer
&gt; &gt; the question we
&gt; &gt; started with, which is "Is an activity a relation?" where at
&gt; &gt; least Pat,
&gt; &gt; Chris P and I would argue that an activity is a
&gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent, and
&gt; &gt; would feel uncompfortable that a relation was a
&gt; &gt; spatio-temporal extent. On
&gt; &gt; the hand many others note that activities are frequently modelled as
&gt; &gt; relations. Perhaps it is OK to do both, in which case is this
&gt; &gt; inconsistent?
&gt; &gt; Or does it just not matter?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt;       Matthew

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew, Mike, et al.,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is a very serious and very difficult question:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am happy to work with these ... but what do we call what
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is in the real
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;world that they refer to?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As soon as you ask that question, you open Pandora's box
&gt; &gt; &gt; of metaphysical problems.  Nominalists, conceptualists, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; realists can talk together quite happily as long as they
&gt; &gt; &gt; use ordinary language for everyday life.  They can also work
&gt; &gt; &gt; together quite happily as long as they use mathematics and
&gt; &gt; &gt; other formalized languages, such as KIF, SQL, FORTRAN, C,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Java, etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But as soon as somebody asks the question "But what do they
&gt; &gt; &gt; refer to in the real world?" all hell breaks loose.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; You immediately get into a heated debate about what is real?
&gt; &gt; &gt; what is reference?  what is the world?  what is meaning?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suggestion:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  1. These philosophical issues, despite their perennial
&gt; &gt; &gt;     interest, have never been solved to everyone's (anyone's?)
&gt; &gt; &gt;     satisfaction.  Of one thing we can be absolutely certain
&gt; &gt; &gt;     is that they will not be solved on this mailing list.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  2. Therefore, I suggest that as a working hypothesis for the
&gt; &gt; &gt;     purpose of the SUO list, we adopt an assumption of "naive
&gt; &gt; &gt;     realism" that says that the world exists, and most of the
&gt; &gt; &gt;     words we use in ordinary language refer to something, but
&gt; &gt; &gt;     let's not worry too much about what it is.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  3. For the purpose of the formalization of the SUO, we adopt
&gt; &gt; &gt;     the position that KIF is the official language to be used
&gt; &gt; &gt;     for everything that can be officially expressed by the SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;     If KIF can't express it, we don't talk about it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I admit that this suggestion is technically known as a "cop out"
&gt; &gt; &gt; that doesn't explain what reality really is.  It is exactly the
&gt; &gt; &gt; same cop out that Wittgenstein adopted as the final line of his
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tractatus:  "Everything that can be said can be said clearly,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; For the SUO, I propose that we modify that line by adding some
&gt; &gt; &gt; extra prepositional phrases:  "Everything that can be said [in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the SUO] can be said clearly [in KIF], and whereof we cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt; speak [in KIF], thereof we must be silent.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an answer to the question of what do relations
&gt; &gt; &gt; really refer to.  It is a pure 100% cop out.  But it is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; only kind of cop out that will allow us to get some work done.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
