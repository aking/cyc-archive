4.  An OAR for Odysseus:  Proposal for an Offline Analytic Resource

This note records a number of questions and reflections that arose in the
process of looking through the array of subtask proposals and in trying to
form a working synthesis from the standpoint of the Learner Interface Team.
Our initial strategy was an attempt to reduce the overall variety of issues
by looking for common threads, hoping to sort out the focal and fundamental
concerns from the more peripheral and derivative possibilities.  In the first
pass of this linking process we looked for repeated mentions of similar ideas
that happened to be addressed from complementary perspectives, with a biased
attention to the themes that we had initially identified as important to the
learner interface role.  In other words:  We put on our learner interface
shirts and ran through the problem's briar patch to see what would stick.

The yield of this run is presented in the present report.  We encountered
a number of superficial snags, for starters, the evident lack of overlap
in perspective and terminology that was being used by different design
groups, but the biggest hitch remains the lack of a complete inference
engine to place at the core of our authoring and our tutoring shells.
A surface effect motor will not get our tutoring vehicle very far up
the grade of intelligent performance.  Given the time frame of the
present project, it is suggested that the best hope that we have
making any headway against these pitfalls is to build an offline
utility for pre-analyzing the following two domains:

| 1.  The conceptual materials and the relational structures
|     of the content domains.
|
| 2.  The script interactions that are foreseeable within the
|     reach of the overall tutoring strategy.

A number of additional problems and directions of approach
will be discussed in subsequent reports.

4.1  Critical Importance of Triadic Relations

Triadic or ternary relations are fundamental structural elements
in complex domains.  They support stable systems of organization
in the content domain and control the dynamics of both the target
system behavior and the Student/Tutor interactions.  This happens
for any number of identifiable reasons, several of which will be
taken up next.

4.1.1  Compositional Closure of Dyadic Relations

| Dyadic or binary relations generate only more of the same
| under composition, leading to chains or to cycles but to
| no more complex structures.

Enough said.

4.1.2  Generative Power of Triadic Relations

| Triadic relations are not closed under composition and can be
| used to give formal analyses of all higher valency relations.

The Instructional Knowledge Team noted several examples
of 3-place relations that were expected to be relevant
to the task of representing knowledge relationships.
These were:

| x joins y to z.
|
| x gives y to z.
|
| x extracts y from z.
|
| x requires y from z.

Some of the 2-place relations that they mention are
closely akin to interesting 3-place place relations,
either by generalization, projection, restriction,
specialization, or combination.  For example,
consider these two relations:

| x resembles y.
|
| x differs from y.

These relations can be extended or generalized by making
an explicit parameter out of their qualifying conditions.
The added qualifier could be either (1) the respect in
which things are considered to be similar or different
at a given moment, or (2) the context in which their
contemplated similarity or difference is thought to
be important.  A significant increase in breadth of
application and informational value is likely to be
gained, at relatively small cost in extra complexity,
by introducing the following species of modifications:

| x resembles y in respect to z.
|
| x differs from y in the context z.
|
| x is not equivalent to y for the purpose z.
|
| x is interchangeable with y in the context z.

A further variation along these lines would suggest the following
kinds of relations, which would naturally arise in many tutoring and
consulting tasks that call for giving advice or making recommendations:

| x is better than y for the purpose z.
|
| x is bettered by y for the purpose z.
|
| x is bested by y in the contest for z.
|
| x is improved on by y in the context z.

These relations have a very handy feature, one that we might call
the &quot;pivotal relay&quot;, &quot;focal transfer&quot;, or &quot;orbital transitivity&quot;
property.  This means that the subrelation named in the first
two places will remain transitive so long as the element in
the last place (the pivot, focus, or center) is kept fixed.
A common way of expressing this property would be:

w  =&lt;_z  x  and  x  =&lt;_z  y  implies  w  =&lt;_z  y.

Another turn of phrase for expressing these relations places the
ground of comparison z in an infix position, letting z stand for
words like Easy, Fast, Good, Helpful, Great/Small, Cheap/Costly,
Clear/Confusing, Friendly/Finicky, Safe/Risky, Accurate, Precise,
Reliable, Simple, Suitable, Timely, Useful, Complete, Informative,
Intelligent, Important, or Powerful:

| y is as z as x.       y  &gt;=_z  x.
|
| y is less z than x.   y   &lt;_z  x.
|
| y is more z than x.   y   &gt;_z  x.

Some of the most important and pervasive relations in logic and
computing are special cases of these last forms.  One of these
is the &quot;interpretation relation&quot; (or &quot;sign relation&quot; for short),
which is given below in two of its many variants:

| y forms as clear a sign of z, their common object, as x.
|
| y is more informative about z, their common topic, than x.

The feature to be appreciated here is the informational value that
is gained in the passage from the antecedent sign, expression, or
representation x to the subsequent sign y.  In briefer terms, this
gain may be conveyed in forms like the following:

| y refers to z as well as x does.    y indicates z as well as x does.
|
| y tells more about z than x does.   y describes z better than x does.

Suppose we are given a set W which includes all of the kinds
of entities that we want to talk about in a given situation,
whether objects, signs, or ideas.  Viewed in extension, an
individual sign relation over W is a set of 3-tuples from
set W which satisfy a description like one of those above.
In other words, a sign relation L is a set of triples of
the form &lt;o, s, i&gt; that form a particular subset of WxWxW.
The roles of the sign relation are given the designations
of the &quot;object&quot;, &quot;sign&quot;, and &quot;interpretant&quot;, but they are
often listed in other orders than this.  Technically, the
interpretant is just another sign, but we often regard it
as a special kind of sign, perhaps an idea or a concept.

A sign relation may be treated in static terms, in the manner
of a cut and dried relation table, or it may be tracked as a
dynamic process, following its transitions from initial signs
to interpretant signs under the governance of objects that may
be fixed or varying through time.

Many essential computing processes function to enhance the clarity
of a symbolic expression or image, that is, to sharpen the quality
of information in an input representation.  All these transformations
fall within the scope of a general theory of sign relations and their
dynamics.  The whole business of converting matrices to their diagonal,
echelon, or canonical forms, of redeeming logical and lambda expressions
for their normal forms -- this entire enterprise is funded through and
through by the class of interpretive exchanges that are implicated in
one or another sign relation.

There is a nice way to visualize the operation of such relations,
especially in the way that they act to organize a whole domain of
entities falling under their application.  Picture the elements of
a given domain scattered about in a space.  Think of z as a binary
switch (on/off) or a multi-choice switch (&quot;radio button&quot;).  Every
time you switch on z, or set the parameter z to a particular choice
z_c, the elements in the field of application become &quot;magnetized&quot; or
polarized in a particular way.  They all line up in organized flows
or streams, each one pointing to its immediate successor (in discrete
domains) or in the direction of all greater elements (in continuous
domains) according to the order relation selected by z_c.  If the
transitive relation we have picked happens to be an equivalence
relation, that is, is also reflexive and symmetric, then these
flow streams or trajectories will form coherent orbits that
partition the space into separate equivalence classes (also
called &quot;fibers&quot;).

As a final point about sign relations, it is important to understand
the intentional quality of interpretation.  This means that the state
of information we are working to develop is usually &quot;inexistent&quot; at the
time we start.  It may be there potentially in the starting materials,
but has to be actualized by the work of computation.  This process is
a constant struggle to advance upstream against the flow of entropy.
It is not as if we have the clear expression and the obscure expression
in mind or memory buffer at one and the same time and merely have the
task of choosing wisely.  The clear sign has to be developed out of the
confused sign.  The process of developing information is not essentially
a matter of choosing between competing sources in a pandemonium of fixed
alternatives, a gladiatorial combat of competing messages in the arena of
fixed opinions.  This is one possibility, but a degenerate one.  This sort
of competition, as often as not, merely serves to continue the pandemonium
and to escalate the level of entropy in our representations of the world.

| Pandemonium.  The Capital of Hell in Milton's 'Paradise Lost'.

To see how generalization and combination can work in tandem,
consider the following relations:

| x uses y.
|
| x permits y.
|
| x controls y.
|
| x requires y.
|
| x is the process for producing y.

These suggest the following 3-place variations and combinations:

| x uses y for z.
|
| x uses y to do z.
|
| x uses y instead of z.
|
| x requires y to achieve z.
|
| x requires y to perform z.
|
| x permits the process y for producing z.
|
| x controls the process y for producing z.

Further, it is useful to notice an important fact about
the 2-place relations that are used to describe series
and parallel compositions of circuits, automata, and
other processes.  For example, consider these:

| x follows y.
|
| x precedes y.
|
| x is concurrent with y.

Parallel and series composition are both special cases of
a more general cascade composition or amalgam operation.
This is a 3-place operation with roughly the same form
as &quot;x joins y to z&quot;.  Other variants of this form are:

| x couples y with z.
|
| x cascades y with z.
|
| x amalgamates y with z.

Finally, the exercise of rehashing these relations has brought us
to the point of a certain realization:  That it might be possible
to simplify the task of computing with relations to a large extent
if we look for a small set of relations, of generic forms and broad
applications, that can be used to generate and to subsume many other
relations of interest in this effort.  Doing this would permit us to
focus our personal energies and our inference engines on a compact
and nearly universal basis without losing any power or scope in
the resulting instrument.

Another way of gaining power and compactness in the inference engine
is to take advantage of the abstract similarities among relations as
much as possible.  For example, all transitive relations share what
is logically the very same axiom for transitivity.  A module of the
inference engine that was tailored to transitive relations could work
equally well on all of those inferences that involve only this axiom,
and would not need to know any more specific features of the relation
instance or relation type that it was passed to work on.  Therefore,
we ought to consider what it would take to formulate in concept and
to organize in practice a &quot;need to know basis&quot; for the requisite
span of relations in our tutoring system.

4.1.3  Incorporation of Dyadic Relations within Triadic Relations

| Dyadic relations can always be viewed, in their formal aspects,
| as degenerate cases of triadic relations, say, with one place
| filled by a default constant, and in many cases it can force
| an insightful twist on a problem or forge a useful continuity
| between the realms of dyadic relations and triadic relations
| to view the former as being incorporated by the latter realm.

As an illustration of this point, consider domains where everything
partitions nicely, under well-tempered parameter choices, making it
possible to state that each pair of elements x_1 and x_2 in a set X
interacts only with each other, not affected by what happens outside
of X.  This sounds at first like a purely dyadic, graph-theoretical
relation, but there's a catch -- namely, the clause that stipulates
&quot;... not affected by ...&quot; as a rider on the independence condition.
This makes it really a degenerate triadic relation, and the implied
qualifier &quot;normally&quot; or &quot;significantly&quot; that hedges this clause by
default can easily change in drastic ways under less well-chosen
boundary conditions, kicking our typical pair out of their garden.

4.1.4  Composition of Relations is Itself a Triadic Relation

| Even when our primary interest resides in a qualitatively rich domain
| of binary relations, one of the first questions we might want to ask
| is how these relations behave under composition.

Consider the space of Thematic Relations from Wagner and Binkert.  Is it true
in some settings that Attributive · Circumstantial = Exhaustive?  For example,
does the composite relation &quot;They have no children without love&quot; mean the same
thing as &quot;They love all their children&quot;?  Is there a multiplication table for
this whole array of ninety-six tiers?

Asking a question of this sort will transport us back to the realm of
triadic relations, since composition is a two-argument operation that
takes two relations to form another, and this is the same thing as
a triadic relation on the space of relations, taken in their own
right as concrete materials to compound together.  There may be
an echo here of the idea that a tutoring system needs to help
students find suitable varieties of &quot;glue&quot; for building up
learning hierarchies from prerequisite pieces of knowledge
(Gagné, cited in Lesgold).  An investigation of logical
connectives and composition operators for relational
concepts might well be applied to the taxonomy of
this &quot;glue&quot;.

4.1.5  Further Examples of Triadic Relations

| Boondoggle.  A term coined by American scoutmaster
| Robert H. Link (circa 1935) to denote a handicraft
| article made of leather or wicker, and subsequently
| applied to describe any trivial, useless, or wasteful
| project or activity.  (Webster's).

The Positive or Negative Instrumentality (or &quot;Good For&quot;) relation:

1.  B is a good beginning or a good basis
    (a bet, boon, benefit, boost, or bootstrap)
    for the achievement of A (an acquisition or accomplishment)
    from the current situation C.

2.  B is a bad beginning or a bad basis
    (a ban, block, barrier, bottleneck, or boondoggle)
    for the achievement of A (an assimilation, accommodation)
    from the current situation C.

Relations that span the spectrum of this type (&quot;Ambivalent Instrumentality&quot;)
keep turning up in the core and at the fringes of the tutoring process, and
they appear to be focal with respect to more than one dimension of content
organization and curriculum planning.  This may be because the role of
a teacher is ultimately, if not initially, mediational in character.
Teaching involves a 3-place relation of teacher, learner, and world,
that is, some object domain that possesses independent interest or
compelling reality for both of the other agents.  The tutor's job
is to provide access pointers to this independent reality, not to
stand in the way.  The tutoring system can make good use of icons,
signs that refer to the world by virtue of a similarity with it,
but it has no direct use for idols, simulations to be worshipped
for their own sake.  This attitude accords with the design goal
of &quot;transparency&quot;, where the instruction stands to one side and
does not block the view of the world, where the medium conveys
its information in a manner so clear as to be nearly invisible.
This design feature can be overdone, however -- there are always
trade-offs.  Taken too far, the learner loses the critical ability
to reflect on the assumptions and the biases of a specific lesson
and no longer sees the need to treat each lesson as a concrete but
bounded possibility of experience -- a visible object with graspable
objectives.  For all of these reasons, it is best that the student
maintain a skeptical regard for the tutoring system.  It will always
be a transitional object with an independent dynamics, constrained by
moments and inertias that interact contingently with the learner's own.

4.1.6  Epitome &amp; Summation

| Triadic relations supply a generative basis for
| the analysis and synthesis of arbitrary relations.
