&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Dear Graham,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would say that there are 3 basic types of thing:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. things that have an extension (exist) in space time (I 
&gt; would call these
&gt; &gt;individuals - but this is a broader use than some would give 
&gt; this word).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2. Things that have members (rather than parts), such as
&gt; &gt;classes/sets/collections. These are timeless.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;3. Ordered collections - Tuples, classifications of them are known as
&gt; &gt;relations. These are timeless, and indeed one way of 
&gt; defining tuples derives
&gt; &gt;them from sets.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me add a few more. First, there are many abstracta (which have no 
&gt; spatiotemporal location) other than collections or ordered 
&gt; collections. In fact, just about any mathematical structure can be 
&gt; considered among these things, and there may be more kinds of 
&gt; mathematical structure than there are kinds of physical object 
&gt; (groups, lattices, topological spaces, modular structures, sheafs, 
&gt; algebras of various kinds, categories, you name it.)

MW: Agreed. We deal with these under class.

&gt; Second, most people (though not all) would make a distinction between 
&gt; the things that occupy space and/or time, on the one hand, and the 
&gt; spaces and/or times that they occupy, on the other.  

MW: I guess we don't, but we used to. Nothing religious, it just doesn't
seem to be necessary in a 4D world. You can always construct the necessary
classes (properties) if you want to.

&gt; Third, there are 
&gt; things that can be located in spacetime without themselves occupying 
&gt; any of spacetime: moments, surfaces of various kinds, point motions, 
&gt; pathways, etc.. 

MW: We deal with these as spatio-temporal extents, in that they exist in
space-time. We aren't particularly worried about the extent vanishing
towards zero in one or more dimensions.

&gt; Geography alone supplies a rich vocabulary for 
&gt; talking about such things and the relationships between them. Then 
&gt; again there are entire other categories of entities, whose locative 
&gt; nature is harder to classify but many people want to have as real, 
&gt; first-class entities: causes, results, manners (the 'way' something 
&gt; is done, eg happily or with a good style), and things indicated by 
&gt; words like 'nature' (small 'n', as in 'it is of the nature of fish to 
&gt; swim in water') , 'tendency', 'attraction'. Others make reference to 
&gt; 'tropes' , in order to make sense of phrases like 'the greenness of 
&gt; the grass delighted me'; it is not enough, on this view to simply 
&gt; refer here to the fact that the grass is green: one has to be able to 
&gt; talk about the *way* that this is true.

MW: All this stuff would be in the classes things belonged to. The
non-trivial bit would be defining the axioms.
&gt; 
&gt; "Promiscuous" ontologies, by the way, admit far more kinds of 
&gt; distinction. For example, consider walking quickly from SRI to 
&gt; Stanford (about a mile; Jerry Hobb's example). Most of us would think 
&gt; of this as one thing, called something like a transporation event. In 
&gt; Jerry's ontology it is several things: at least two: a going from SRI 
&gt; to Stanford (which is slow, since one is walking rather than driving) 
&gt; and a walking from SRI to Stanford (which is fast, since one is 
&gt; hurrying along). In general , how many things it is depends on how 
&gt; many ways there are to describe it.

MW: Well, we try to distinguish between things and their descriptions, so we
would have one thing with different descriptions that applied in different
contexts.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Regards
&gt; &gt;      Matthew

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pat,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	.	Thanks for this reply.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	.	From it I take it that there are three kinds of items to
&gt; &gt; &gt; consider:
&gt; &gt; &gt; *	objects, including immaterial ones like emotions, sensations,
&gt; &gt; &gt; opinions, knowledge, whose attributes (including 
&gt; existence) are 4-D;
&gt; &gt; &gt; *	relations between objects, whose attributes are also 4-D, eg.
&gt; &gt; &gt; friendship; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; *	time histories of objects and relations, and their
&gt; &gt; &gt; attributes, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; are 3-D (timeless);
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	.	Is that a fair summary, or is there a point you
&gt; &gt; &gt; feel I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; missed?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I think there are worlds you have missed here. For example, I dont 
&gt; understand the sense in which an emotion can be 4-D or 3-D. I wouldnt 
&gt; describe an emotion as an abject at all (though it may be an entity.)
&gt; 
&gt; I also don't think that it is right to say that a relation has 4-d 
&gt; attributes. One perceived advantage of the 4-d way of thinking is 
&gt; that relations have *no* spatiotemporal attributes.
&gt; 
&gt; And finally, its not right to say that an attribute of something is 
&gt; 3-d and therefore timeless. It is timeless because it makes to 
&gt; refernece to time: it does not hold relative to a time, or at one 
&gt; time but not at another. But that doesnt make it 3-D. I dont know 
&gt; whatquite in what sense an attribute can be said to even have a 
&gt; dimension.
