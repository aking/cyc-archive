&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; You asked for some clarification.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, it all depends upon how you define extension -
&gt; and it seems to me that this is not so simple for relations.

I think that I would be rather "standard" in my thinking, for once --
just for the sake of novelty, I guess -- if I take the extension of
a k-place relation to be the set of ordered k-tuples that satisfy the
relation in question.  Yes, there is an arbitrary log(k) bits of choice
that goes into the particular ordering, but the "standard" way that all
of the duly ordained "formal or logical or mathematical orders" (FOLOMO's)
handel this sort of thing is by waving their hands about in the air while
muttering some benign invocation like "without loss of geniality" (WOLOG),
or so I appear to hear.

&gt; If you define the extension of a relation as a tuple of the elements -
&gt; this begs the question.  This is fine for the 'bare' view, but misses
&gt; the target for the 'content' view, where the 'positions' are named rather
&gt; than ordered/numbered.  It seems to me easier to regard the two views as
&gt; telling different stories about the extensions of relations.

I think that we may agree here, but I could be wrong.
I have even gone to a whole lot of trouble in my own work --
the "Diff Log &amp; Dyn Sys" paper, just to mention one locus --
to rephrase the usual material of vector spaces in a "named",
as a perfectly viable alternative to the "numbed", stylistic.
And "telling different stories about being" is for me a very
apt rendition of what I am talking about when I prattle on
about "Analytic Differential Ontology" (ADO).

&gt; This can be illustrated by the relation - Jacob is the child of Abraham.

It is here, with this fixation on isolated instances of relations,
calling on them in the name of "relation", that I begin to sense
that something important is being taken in vain.

&gt; Then &lt;Jacob, Abraham&gt; is the extension of the bare relation
&gt; belonging to the 'is a child of' relation class.  The tuple
&gt; &lt;Abraham, Jacob&gt; of course does not belong to this class,
&gt; but to the 'is a parent of' class.

This is all just a matter of the appropriate stage-setting to me.

&gt; However, if we take a content view, then we have 'Jacob as son'
&gt; and 'Abraham as father' participating in the relation - and the
&gt; order does not matter - and the 'is a parent of' and 'is a child of'
&gt; relations are the same relation.

Big trouble lurks in a statement like that!
You need but consult the OEDipal Oracle to
Get some wind of the ill that will inherit.

Terms like "-- is a child of --" and "-- is a parent of --"
may be taken to name relations, but, technically speaking,
terms like "child of" and "parent of" do not name relations,
but are called "relative terms".  This is incidental, but
I thought that I ought to check to see if we agree here.

&gt; A more satisfactory arrangement as they
&gt; seem to describe the same state of affairs.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are an extensionalist you could argue that the elements
&gt; and their order in the tuple give you the means of identification.

I am neither brand of "-ist".  Generally speaking, I try to avoid the
use of the prefixation "anti-" and the suffixations "-ism" and "-ist",
save for "prism" and "schism", going so far as to recommend the calling of
a "pragmatic thinker" or a "pragmatician" to "pragmatist" or "pragmaticist".

For the past many years, I have been working to develop the
extensional side of the pragmatic theory of sign relations,
in spite of the circumstance that it does not always come
natural to me, simply because that is the side of things
where the least amount of work has already been done.

Time is constantly being broken -- mine, anyway --
so I will have to return to the remainder later.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey

Rest Of Chris Partridge's Note Follows:

&gt; However, just adding an intensional element to this view does not lead to
&gt; a content view - as the bare view is based upon order (numbering the places)
&gt; whereas the content view names them - and does not imply an order.
&gt; 
&gt; You wrote:
&gt;
&gt; "That is to say, if one pictures a k-place relation
&gt; as a k-column relational data table"
&gt; 
&gt; This is easy to say or 'picture', but it is not
&gt; so easy to deal with the details of the transition.
&gt; 
&gt; Let us say you have a two column table, ColA first and then ColB.
&gt; And the first row has a first and then b.  Under the bare view
&gt; we have &lt;a, b&gt; belonging to the relation class ColA-ColB.
&gt; Now transpose the columns.  Do we now have &lt;b, a&gt;
&gt; belonging to ColB-ColA, or has nothing changed?
&gt; 
&gt; Note that, as I think I said in my previous email, under the bare view
&gt; the super-sub-class mechanism extrapolated easily from objects to relations.
&gt; But under the content view it does not.  It becomes something more like an
&gt; ontological dependence.  However the transitivity of both of these can be
&gt; captured by a coarse grained axiom using material implication.
&gt; 
&gt; You wrote:
&gt;
&gt; "to speak of the "place-j domain" of a relation"
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me that this presupposes, with its notion of
&gt; ordered places, at least the beginnings of a bare relation view.
&gt; 
&gt; One more point.  I and then you wrote:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Under a bare relation view there is,
&gt; &gt; of course, no such thing as a particular
&gt; &gt; (in its strong sense) between relation.
&gt;
&gt; Now I am just totally lost ..."
&gt; 
&gt; If one is an extensionalist (which as you have noted, you are not)
&gt; then to say a is between b and c is, from a bare relation perspective,
&gt; to say that &lt;a, b, c&gt; belongs to the between relation class.
&gt; The &lt;a, b, c&gt; tuple is not in any sense inherently 'between' -
&gt; between-ness resides at the level of the relation class.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this clarifies things.
&gt;

&gt; Chris

&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Chris, David, Dieter, Matthew, ...
&gt; 
&gt; Let me offer what I think would be a more helpful heading
&gt; for this subject, one which includes the specification of
&gt; the domains of definition of a relation as a special case.
&gt; Under this "form of generalization" (FOG), one may regard
&gt; an arbitrary relation -- and if I deem to say "arbitrary",
&gt; you can bet that I mean it with that proverbial vengeance,
&gt; conceptively encircling in one swell foop many multitudes
&gt; of hosts of relations for which the quarter of a constant
&gt; or even a definite adicity (arete, valence) cannot exactly
&gt; be exacted or expected, but never mind all of that now --
&gt; like I was saying, one may regard one's so-called "source"
&gt; relation as being "related" -- for let us not prejudge the
&gt; end of the day's fray by speaking of its being "reduced" --
&gt; to another collection of one's so-called "target" relations.
&gt; 
&gt; In many situations, we may speak of this relation between
&gt; source and target relations as a relation of "projection",
&gt; but one will most likely be able to think of other brands
&gt; of relations between relations that are not apt to fall,
&gt; nor very aptly to be cast, under this "projective" pall.
&gt; But never mind all that now -- it is best to start with
&gt; the easy examples and the familiar facets of phenomena.
&gt; 
&gt; In this view, to speak of the "place-j domain" of a relation
&gt; is to speak of what remains to speak of in the relation when
&gt; we choose not to speak of what resides in the other places of
&gt; the relation.  That is to say, if one pictures a k-place relation
&gt; as a k-column relational data table -- "But is it a table already
&gt; filled or a table yet to be filled?" you cleverly ask, and I will
&gt; have to let my silence pass for the promise to think on an answer
&gt; anon -- then one may think of this table as being set, that is to
&gt; say, quite literally defined, by the specification of those very
&gt; k projections onto those very k target domains of which we desire
&gt; to speak.  And that is "sort of" how the "a la cartesian product"
&gt; is actually defined in Category Theory, as best I can remember on
&gt; the current occasion, or as best I can tell at the present moment.
&gt; 
&gt; In sum, a question about the place-j domain of a k-place relation
&gt; is a question about the place-j projection of that k-place relation
&gt; onto a monadic relation, in short, it's about a projection onto a set.
&gt; 
&gt; One step up from this question, one can ask about about the projections
&gt; of a source relation onto targets that are all of them dyadic relations.
&gt; 
&gt; And so it goes ...
&gt; 
&gt; By way of trying to establish parallels between different forms of language,
&gt; I will try to go through the rest of this exchange between Chris and Dieter,
&gt; and to say how I would try to describe, from the POV that is outlined above,
&gt; what it appears from this perspective is being talked about here.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Deiter,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am interested in some of your comments re: relation.
&gt; &gt; They bring up a point that has been bothering me for
&gt; &gt; some time.  And maybe one on which the SUO needs to
&gt; &gt; make an informed choice?  Anyway I'd be interested
&gt; &gt; in your position.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that there are (at least) two views
&gt; &gt; regarding particular relations in use in computing
&gt; &gt; (Fritz Lehmann of Cyc has made a similar point).
&gt; 
&gt; "(at least) two views"
&gt; 
&gt; I am mostly concerned with relating
&gt; "relations given by extension" to
&gt; "relations given by intension" so
&gt; I am hoping at this point that the
&gt; two views that you mention will be
&gt; ones that I can successfully relate
&gt; to questions of their ex-/in-tensions.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One based in set theory may be called the 'bare relation' theory.
&gt; &gt; In this view there are tuples (bare relations) with effectively
&gt; &gt; no real content.
&gt; 
&gt; I would say that a relation is always something more
&gt; than any of its tuples, and even if the extension of
&gt; the relation happens to be a singleton set, since,
&gt; even then, most will say that {&lt;x1, ..., xk&gt;} is
&gt; something more than &lt;x1, ..., xk&gt;.
&gt; 
&gt; Peirce used the term "elementary relation" as the
&gt; intensional correspondent of the extensional tuple,
&gt; but this is a fine point that one commonly glosses over.
&gt; 
&gt; When you said "real content", I was just guessing that
&gt; you meant something about a thing having intensional
&gt; attributes, features, or properties.  Is that close?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One based more on database theory (within computing) assumes that
&gt; &gt; particular relations have content -- that there is, for example,
&gt; &gt; a particular 'between relation' between a number of particular
&gt; &gt; things (I believe (some?) DLs also take this view -- could you
&gt; &gt; confirm this?  Maybe OIL also takes this view?).
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am guessing that my previous guess was wrong.
&gt; Here, you seem to be using "content" to describe
&gt; the extension of a relation.  Is that closer?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This seems to be what you are talking about when you wrote:
&gt; &gt; "Any particular relation is not itself a set of relations.
&gt; &gt; 'between' does not specify a set of between-ness relations,
&gt; &gt; it's just a particular relation."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Under a bare relation view there is,
&gt; &gt; of course, no such thing as a particular
&gt; &gt; (in its strong sense) between relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I am just totally lost ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The advantage of the 'bare relation' view is that
&gt; &gt; it uses a single mechanism for 'inheritance' over
&gt; &gt; 'concepts' and 'relations' (as you have classified them).
&gt; &gt; The disadvantage of the 'content' view is that is substitutes
&gt; &gt; inference for inheritance -- x-father-y-son implies x-parent-y-child --
&gt; &gt; rather than (x, y) is a member of (father-son) and (parent-child)
&gt; &gt; and (father-son) is a sub-class of (parent-child).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is of course only the begining of the story --
&gt; &gt; there is much more to consider when making the judgement.
&gt; &gt; However the choice has implications for the axioms you use
&gt; &gt; to manage relation 'inheritance'.
&gt; 
&gt; Any clarification that anybody can supply would be appreciated ...
&gt;
