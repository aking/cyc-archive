Dear Jon,

I continue the struggle through the mists of ambiguity - 
hopefully towards you rather than away.

I think I am going to start again, trying to adopt some of 
the things you have suggested.

Purpose:

To take what is represented by an n-ary relation, and 
represent it by n binary relations and a set/class of objects.

Method:

For each tuple 

&lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;

that is a member of the n-ary relation (R) create exactly
one object (x) that is a member of the set of objects (S).

For each component of the tuple create a binary tuple that
is a member of a relation that indicates the place in the original
tuple that the component stands in. e.g.

place1 &lt;x, component1&gt;

e.g. if I have:

 (gives1 John Mary Book1)

If I apply the above method I might get:

(gives2 x)
(giver-in John x)
(receiver-in Mary x)
(given-in Book1 x)

&gt; &gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  OK well let me first try to state a method,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      you will have to forgive some lack of formality,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If it can be formalized, I will help you to formalize it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      but it should not be so unclear what I mean.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  My optimism never ceases to amaze me!
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, I probably could have continued to continue my sequence
&gt; of "moderately intelligent and well-informed guesses" (MIAWIG's),
&gt; but I get a bit edgy doing that in a case like this, and in many
&gt; cases, you see what happens -- people end up with a tangled web
&gt; of deceptive impressions of understanding each other -- and so
&gt; I have learned to distrust my openly operative optimiasm, too,
&gt; when it gets down to the nitty-gritty of any semiotic process.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      Where I come from this method would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      informally known as reification.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Gasp!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Purpose:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To take any n-adic relation occurence and turn it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into n binary relations without loss of meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; I did not notice on my first parse that you use this
&gt; phrase "n-adic relation occurrence" here, too, right
&gt; at the outset.  I guess that the first time I read
&gt; it I took it as "an example of an n-adic relation",
&gt; and not as "an n-tuple in an n-adic relation".
&gt; Which do you mean it to be?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Method:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Create an object (say x) that stands
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the n-adic relation as a whole.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is x what we would call a "relation name"?
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is the phrase "stands for" that makes
&gt; &gt; &gt; me think this.  If not, why not just say
&gt; &gt; &gt; that x is an n-adic relation?  When you
&gt; &gt; &gt; say "relation as a whole" do you mean
&gt; &gt; &gt; a set of n-tuples?  If so, can we then
&gt; &gt; &gt; say that x is a set of n-tuples?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  x replaces the tuple rather than a relation.
&gt; &gt;      So x replaces &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This does not mean that x = &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; there is a relationship, but it is one of
&gt; &gt; derivability rather than equality.
&gt; 
&gt; The words "derive" and "derivability" are dear technical terms for me,
&gt; though it is true they are terms of art in at least three arts I know.
&gt; So unless you can define yet another new meaning for them for me, or
&gt; else relate their sense to you to some of those that I already know,
&gt; I am afraid that we are back to square one, if a little off base.
&gt; Personally, I had the impression, though it might be illusory,
&gt; of course, of having understood you better when you used the
&gt; phrase "Create an object (say x) that 'stands for' the n-adic
&gt; relation as a whole", since "stands for" is something that
&gt; I can assimilate as "denotes", "represents", or "signifies",
&gt; though, of course, when you go on to say "n-adic relation"
&gt; later on in this very same pharse, I no longer know with
&gt; any certainty whether you do indeed mean what I would mean
&gt; if I were to say "n-adic relation" or whether you mean instead
&gt; what I would mean if I said "n-adic relation instance" or just
&gt; plain "n-tuple".  In ordinary speech I would, of course, allow
&gt; for a certain amount of poetic license, but you know where that
&gt; will land us, booted clean out of this republic of disambiguity,
&gt; and in any case, even such as I see the need for being extremely
&gt; careful, here, at the very underpinnings of ontological security.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take each each element in the relation occurance
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is what you call a "relation occurrence"
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same thing as a "relation instance",
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is, an n-tuple?  Or is it the x?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  The relation occurence is a tuple,
&gt; &gt;      an element is the thing in a place in a tuple.
&gt; &gt;      So &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, I sometimes speak this way, too, when I am speaking loosely,
&gt; but that is not right at this moment, and so let me recommend the
&gt; usage of the term "component", which is a fair "stand-up-onym",
&gt; standardly understood on several continents and in not a few
&gt; widely practiced disciplines, instead of this "element", which,
&gt; as a keyword, will lead many astrayingly to think of that more
&gt; straighforwardly set-theoretic "elementhood" or "membership"
&gt; relation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and create a relation between it and x.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I am guessing then that "relation occurrence" means 
&gt; "n-tuple".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; So far, so good.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; But then what do you mean by "each element in the 
&gt; relation occurrence"?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you mean "each component of the n-tuple"?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Sounds right -- see above.
&gt; 
&gt; Check, at least, until our licenses are revoked.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am stuck at this point, and will need to wait for clarification.
&gt; 
&gt; To sum it up so far, let us see where we stand at present.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  We will need to be brutally clear, in future,
&gt;     as to when we are talking about n-tuples, and
&gt;     when we are talking about sets of n-tuples.
&gt; 
&gt;     For instance, a phrase like "relation as a whole",
&gt;     will, I'll bet, lead most folks who speak of such
&gt;     things to think of the "whole relation", which is
&gt;     broadly (extensionally) understood to be a set of
&gt;     tuples, or deeply (intensionally) comprehended as
&gt;     a property (intension) that all such tuples share.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  I am thoroughly mystified by your use of terms
&gt;     like "derivability", "replaces", &amp; "stands for"
&gt;     to describe the relation between x and a tuple,
&gt;     or else possibly between x and a set of tuples?
&gt; 
&gt; If you can clear up this little bit of underbrush,
&gt; I think that we may be poised to venture into the
&gt; interior.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks In Prospect,
&gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Use the role that the element plays
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the original relation to name
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this binary relation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Example:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary Book1)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      (and (gives x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           (giver John)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           (receiver Mary)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           (given book1)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      )
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; )
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (probably flakey, but I hope intelligible.)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
