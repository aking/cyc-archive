Dear Matthew, 
	.		This answers several e-mails from you that have just
rolled in, addressed to me. 

	.	Basically, it is evident I have interpreted some of your
words as being more hostile to Ian than they apparently were intended to be.
It still happens when I read them, so it must relate to differences in
interpretation. It sounded to me that you were opposed to Ian's work being
continued or kept, and the only benefits would be the lessons learned in
producing it. 

	.	I hope you have seen from earlier e-mails today that I
support both your and Ian's work. I hope we can benefit from both of you and
your products. 

	.	Your idea about modularising the effort, and working on
different sections sounds like it has potential, provided compatibility is
maintained. Naturally, there will have to be agreement between you about the
divvying up of the work portions. 

	.	I accept your assertions that the various documents you have
sent heave given approaches to merging structures, etc. Possibly, like me,
Ian has been swamped with all the e-mail traffic on this project. It is
really getting excessive. 

	.	I don't comprehend the significance of your previous comment
about EXPRESS being "long on structure and short on axioms". Does this
affect its utility? I think your gist was possibly that the way would be to
translate EPISTLE into SUO-KIF anyway, wasn't it? 

	.	I've got to say, I wish these were written in ACE or the
like. I'd have a chance of reading them myself, then. As it is, any
contributions are going to be very laboured.

&gt; Dear Matthew, 
&gt; 	.		These are instances of colourful 
&gt; rhetoric putting a
&gt; definitely emotional perspective. 

MW: Well that is one way to describe the use of analogy, but the only
emotion I am suffering from is frustration that this effort might be dragged
into a direction where a lot of effort is expended for no great purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	However, I suggest they do not present the only ways of
&gt; viewing the principles you have raised. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Let's stay balanced in our comments. 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Ian,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; What this says to me is that given some available sources, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have done
&gt; &gt; &gt; something minimal to bring these sources into one document 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and eliminate any
&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious conflicts. What you do not convince me of is that you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a grand
&gt; &gt; &gt; plan of the parts of the ontology that will be required, the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; paradigms that
&gt; &gt; &gt; will be supported, and an approach for filling in that framework.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You're right that I don't have a "grand plan of the parts of 
&gt; &gt; the ontology
&gt; &gt; that will be required", and I think this is as it should be.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Oh, so you think it is better to travel without a map.
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	If you think you know the map (and I mean the content, 
&gt; not just the
&gt; list of required planning and support documentation we need 
&gt; by the time the
&gt; project is complete), then, let's see it. 
&gt; 

MW: I have developed (and given references to) similar documents for the
development of data models for similar purposes. When we undertook that work
in EPISTLE we concluded that it was better to produce those documents (the
map) before we undertook large scale modelling. It saved a great deal of
effort. Building models in KIF is not so different from doing so in an
Entity Relationship language. Most of the issues and principles stay the
same.

MW: However, you seem to have a very short memory, so I will repeat again a
list of document that make a better start point for discussion of what we
should do and how we should do it than just picking up some bits of ontology
and merging them together:

MW: ISO 18876-1 WD5 Integration of Industrial Data for Exchange Access and
Sharing: Overview and Architecture

MW: This document shows how a number of different models/ontologies can be
integrated. The methodology preserves the original model/ontology whilst
allowing the creation of an integration model/ontology. Different
integration models/ontologies can be created and linked by application
models/ontologies that are concepts that can be mapped into both
models/ontologies.

MW: ISO 18876-2 WD5 Integration of Industrial Data for Exchange Access and
Sharing: Integration and Mapping Methodology

MW: The methodology for how to operate the above architecture.

MW: "Some notes on the nature of things"

MW: An outline in plain language of a rationale for 4D a ontology/model.

MW: The above can be found at <A  HREF="http://www.ISO18876.org">http://www.ISO18876.org</A> if you dig around a
bit. All have been mentioned several times.

MW: "Developing High Quality Data Models V2"
<A  HREF="http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle/data/modelling/">http://www.stepcom.ncl.ac.uk/epistle/data/modelling/</A>

MW: This document illustrates a number of traps that that those developing
data models frequently fall into when developing data models. It also
presents some principles for how to avoid these traps. In (at least) one
e-mail exchange here I have presented a version of these principles adapted
for KIF. They are not that complicated, but the current model does not
support them.

MW: EPISTLE Core Model V3.2 Revision 6 (aka ISO 15926-2 DIS draft)

MW: A data model which I posted in the last few days, part of which I
translated into KIF in November, and reposted again recently.

MW: So I really do not understand how you can accuse me of not presenting
the bits of the map I have. I only wish people would look at it, apparently
including you.

MW: I am not so arrogant as to suggest that the work mentioned above is
perfect in any sense. No map is. The point of a map is that it guides
travellers better than no map at all, and passes on the experience of other
travellers (or map makers).

&gt; &gt; I will suggest
&gt; &gt; additions to the ontology, other people will suggest other 
&gt; &gt; additions, and
&gt; &gt; some people will argue that some of these proposed additions 
&gt; &gt; should not be
&gt; &gt; incorporated into the merged ontology.  I don't think it would be
&gt; &gt; appropriate for one person to provide the entire framework 
&gt; &gt; for a project
&gt; &gt; that requires the consenus of a wide range of experts.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: The foundation or outline is a level at which we can 
&gt; discuss what we are
&gt; going to do and how, without actually wasting a lot of time 
&gt; doing things at
&gt; the detailed level. Of course it is not for one person to 
&gt; decide, any more
&gt; than the detail is. 
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	Fine, but that doesn't damn Ian's work to date. 

MW: Where have I damned Ian's work? I have been careful to say it is
valuable. It is just not a good enough starting point for standardisation.
In my view the big mistake here is asking for a vote, and more particularly
the nature of what we were asked to vote on.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm  not sure what
&gt; &gt; you mean by the "paradigms that will be supported".  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: e.g. 3D and 4D.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for  an approach for
&gt; &gt; filling in the ontology, my plan is to align the remaining 
&gt; &gt; candidate SUO
&gt; &gt; sources with the merged ontology. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If we start somewhere, and move off in some direction without 
&gt; &gt; &gt; considering
&gt; &gt; &gt; where we are trying to get to, then there is no reason why we 
&gt; &gt; &gt; should arrive
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the desired place, because we don't even know how to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recognise it if we
&gt; &gt; &gt; arrived there.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree.  I am using the "IEEE SUO Scope and Purpose" as my 
&gt; &gt; guide, and I
&gt; &gt; hope others are as well.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: That's a bit like saying "The objective is to win the 
&gt; war, now lets just
&gt; start skirmishing and see where we go"
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	It's a bit like saying all sorts of other things as 
&gt; well. We don't
&gt; have an enemy for starters. I suggest analogies should be as 
&gt; precise as
&gt; possible, and I don't think this one is. 

MW: OK it is like starting a large project without a project plan, or it is
like constructing a complex engineering artifact without a design. It is
anything large where you start withou knowing where you are going, or or how
you are going to get there.
&gt;
