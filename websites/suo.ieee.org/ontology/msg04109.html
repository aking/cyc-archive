Matthew, Adam, et al.,

In response to a recent posting by Matthew (in response to Adam) on the 
SUO list, I am posting this to ONT instead, but feel free to kick 
it back up to SUO if you think it appropriate.

(Note, I see this just crossed John's post to the SUO list...)


Matthew says:

&lt;little snip&gt;

&gt; MW: An ontology is really overkill for this. Though I should perhaps make
&gt; clear some distinctions I use related to terms like ontology.
&gt; 
&gt;  - Taxonomy, a dictionary of standard terms and their natural language
&gt;    definitions.
&gt; 
&gt;  - Thesaurus, a taxonomy with subtype/supertype relations.
&gt; 
&gt;  - Data Model, a structure of types and relations against which instances
&gt;    of the types and relations can be stored. Definitions of the types and
&gt;    relations are in natural language. Some constraints are defined, usually
&gt;    in terms of the cardinality of relationships.
&gt; 
&gt;  - Ontology, types, relations, and possibly instances of those together
&gt;    with axioms, usually in First Order Logic, that define the rules that
&gt;    apply to members of the types and relations.
&gt; 
&gt; Data Models are what are usually developed/used to design a database. The
&gt; axioms of an ontology are generally of little use/relevance either in the
&gt; design of the database, or in the population of it by instances.
&gt; 
&gt; So in general my question for this sort of case would be: Why would you
&gt; develop an ontology (more work) when a data model will do?

&lt;big snip&gt;

1. Would people on this list agree with Matthew's distinctions between
data models and ontologies?  

On the one hand, it does seem that the key distinction is the use of 
axioms, which in turn allow for inferences above and beyond what might 
be stored in a database (based on a data model). On the other hand, one 
often encounters, in doing  data modeling, certain constraints, which  
are, in effect, &quot;rules that apply to members of the types and  
relations.&quot;  Is there a sharp  distinction between the kinds of rules  
used to define constraints in data models and the kinds of rules defined 
via axioms in ontologies?

2. And what is the role of logic in defining these rules (for data models
and for ontologies)? I ask the question broadly, but one particular issue
I am interested in is the use of implications (if-then statements) to 
express these rules. For the database case especially, such rules seem
to be expressed as implications. Similarly, I think, for the ontology 
case.  But typically the logic used in an ontology goes much further, or 
so it seems to me. For instance, won't any logic used to represent
an ontology also have pegged to it inference rules, a proof theory,
and a semantics?  Do all these logical extras exist also in, say, a
relational data model, and is the reason they are not so apparent is
that the relevant subset of first-order logic is in essence hard-wired
and implicit in the relational model? 

Could someone elaborate on the different ways in which logic is used to 
define the rules both in data models and ontologies, perhaps especially 
focusing on the common logical flavor of if-then rules in both cases?


3. Related to the second point above, as well as to the SUO's effort in 
creating an ontology, can one express the kind of ontology we are after 
_without_ using logic?  That is, for the kind of computer-crunchable 
ontology that the SUO effort seeks to create, could it exist without 
logic? I suspect that it could, but that such an ontology would be an 
impoverished one. 

Two more, if I may.

4. Related to the third point, is a logic-based, machine-processable
representation of an ontology particularly apt for our purposes, for 
the following reasons?  

One could say that ontology is concerned with &quot;what is,&quot; the things that exist and the relations among 
those things. Logic (plus) model theory is an appropriate way to express 
the notions of an ontology, because the syntax of logic can represent 
things that are, and the model theory of a logic allows us to say &quot;what 
is so.&quot;  Does this make any sense?


5. Finally, related to the points three and four above, and to some recent 
discussion on the SUO list about the language for the SUO (which I think
have been raised before -- and settled????), I have a question for 
Adam (and John and Chris and whoever else cares to chime in).

Simply put, &quot;Where is the semantics of SUMO?&quot;

Don't clobber me; I think I may have an inkling of the answer, but I need
some help to make things clearer to me.  My inkling is: &quot;Well, the semantics
of SUMO is given, essentially, via the semantics of KIF (or the version
that SUMO uses).&quot;


The semantics of KIF (to be superseded by the semantics of CL) -- well, 
there is where I have a question.  On the one hand, there is a model theory 
for KIF at <A  HREF="http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/semantics.tex">http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/semantics.tex</A>

On the other hand, accordinig to the draft standard at 
<A  HREF="http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/dpans.html">http://logic.stanford.edu/kif/dpans.html</A> 

&quot;The language has declarative semantics. It is possible to understand the 
meaning of expressions in the language without appeal to an interpreter 
for manipulating those expressions.&quot;

I'm guessing that KIF's semantics is defined by the model theory document,
but how to account for the above mention of a &quot;declarative semantics&quot;?

Thanks,

Jim
