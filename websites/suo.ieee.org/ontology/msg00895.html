Dear Jon,

You wrote:
&gt;
&gt; A misunderstanding has developed between
&gt; Phil Jackson and myself for which I have
&gt; already sent him a carte blanche apology
&gt; off-list.  Since the later stages of the
&gt; misunderstanding appear to me to involve
&gt; a tangle of factors that I cannot remedy,
&gt; traceable perhaps to misapperceptions of
&gt; the intentions behind certain manners of
&gt; expression to which diverse temperaments
&gt; are likely to resort, for which conducts
&gt; it would be an act of some hypocrisy for
&gt; me to apologize, since I do not know any
&gt; way that I might be able to gain control
&gt; over their ilk and thus be able to avoid
&gt; the occasions of their recurrence in the
&gt; future, it is incumbent on me to try and
&gt; root out at least the original causes of
&gt; the misunderstanding insofar as they lie
&gt; within some controlable error on my part.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore I have gone over Phil's initial communique,
&gt; and I have found what I think to be my first mistake
&gt; in interpreting it, which I will mark below as a way
&gt; of exposing my sin against him and his epistle to us.

I accept your apology though I should make clear to all that I do not see
any mistake in your original reply to my email, which follows. The concern I
had was of a different sort and is discussed further toward the end of this
message.

&gt; &gt; Phil,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Long time no see!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for helping me to pin down the locations
&gt; &gt; of some of the tenter-hooks that we are hung-up
&gt; &gt; and hanging-on here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will just interject, within your text,
&gt; &gt; the first things that come into my mind.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Jim, and all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Once again I will jump into the fray with a few
&gt; &gt; &gt; comments and suggestions for how to proceed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It seems to me that SUO has been making progress,
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet three central issues are unresolved:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) What are the objectives for use of the SUO?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) What are the requirements for the SUO?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What are the requirements for the language(s)
&gt; &gt; &gt;    in which the SUO will be represented?
&gt; &gt; &gt;

[... removing the rest of my original message and resuming with Jon's
original reply:]

&gt; &gt; Okay, this seems to identify one of the main sticking points
&gt; &gt; for me personally, and I have only recently been able to get
&gt; &gt; enough of a pers-pective on it to barely begin to figure out
&gt; &gt; what the matter actually is.  It seems to be a bit like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I initially began participating in the various threads
&gt; that have been
&gt; &gt; more or less dedicated to "Semiotics Formalization" (SF), I did
&gt; not at all
&gt; &gt; realize the difference in perspective that existed between me
&gt; and the rest
&gt; &gt; of the participants who were apparently quite interested in the
&gt; same topic.
&gt; &gt; In its critical points, as best I can see right now, after a
&gt; long spell of
&gt; &gt; extremely puzzled reflection, the difference appears to be a
&gt; bit like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  One POV (that I am now guessing is the outlook of most
&gt; KIF^n Cousins,
&gt; &gt;     Parolees of La Logique FOLie, and other participants in
&gt; this e-agora)
&gt; &gt;     views the whole divided subject-matter of semiology/semiotics as not
&gt; &gt;     a whit more than "yet another subject matter" (YASM) for rolling up
&gt; &gt;     in the Universal Wrapper of their favorite Logic, whether
&gt; the Goodies
&gt; &gt;     be candied, cyclamated, diet, filled, "lite",
&gt; NP-hard-or-soft-centered,
&gt; &gt;     saccharin, sugared, or whatever variety of confection they
&gt; may confect
&gt; &gt;     to be wrapped-up in their bag.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  One POV (mine, perhaps other Perseans, byzantine,
&gt; canonical, or otherwise)
&gt; &gt;     quite literally views this semeiotic/semitotic zygote, the
&gt; homunculus of
&gt; &gt;     all future sense to be borne in time, as a more general
&gt; subject than logic --
&gt; &gt;     though perhaps more "primitive", more "rudimentary", more
&gt; "savage" (in the
&gt; &gt;     sense of 'La Pensée Sauvage' by Claude Levi-Strauss) would
&gt; be better words
&gt; &gt;     to use for its relationship to what we think "in" and "of"
&gt; as Formal Logic.
&gt; &gt;     In this light, this tool, or the brand of it that I
&gt; personally prefer to
&gt; &gt;     call the "pragmatic theory of signs" (PTOS) is the prior
&gt; instrument, the
&gt; &gt;     precursive methodology, the proto-organon that I use in
&gt; order to study
&gt; &gt;     the more evolved dynamics and the more formalized implementations of
&gt; &gt;     logic itself, in whatever "language of the month" that it
&gt; may happen,
&gt; &gt;     for the moment, to find itself flavored and wrapped up in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Have To Break Now,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jon Awbrey
&gt;
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~KRAM~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt;
&gt; Okay, what is now rather abundantly clear to me
&gt; on my second reading of the following paragraph
&gt; is that -- well, not desiring to be attributing
&gt; intentions to another, I have to say that it is
&gt; only my next hypothesis -- that Phil's comments
&gt; about semiosis are not really intended to raise
&gt; that subject as a topic for discussion but only

My comments about semiosis were intended to note that it is a topic for
discussion, regarding which the requirements for SUO had apparently not yet
been fully agreed by all concerned.

&gt; to set it down as one of many possible examples
&gt; that might be adduced to illustrate his mediate
&gt; concern with a number of more procedural issues,
&gt; and so it was only my overriding interest, even
&gt; obsession, with this single substantive subject
&gt; that led me to run rough shod over the intended
&gt; purpose of his note.  This, of course, was very
&gt; insensitive, and quite out of keeping with that
&gt; brand of regard that has become the hallmark of
&gt; our discussions here.  And the instance of such
&gt; a behavior, on my part, is something that I can
&gt; say that I genuinely regret.  I shall take more
&gt; care with that aspect of my conduct from now on.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there
&gt; &gt; &gt; are questions that are unresolved about the requirements.
&gt; &gt; &gt; E.g. the Scope discussion says "an upper ontology is
&gt; &gt; &gt; limited to concepts that are meta, generic, abstract,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ontology should include "semiotic concepts" or should
&gt; &gt; &gt; only include things that "really exist" in the world.

I did not find any insensitivity in your original reply above, in wanting to
further explore the topic of semiosis and its relevance to SUO, with me and
others. To further explore this topic, I started a thread titled "What is
the role of semiotics in SUO?".

In response you wrote a message entitled "Lo, The Veil Of Transparency Is
Over All!", the tone of which greatly surprised and disappointed me -- gone
was the friendliness shown in your original reply, and the cheerfulness
shown in other postings I've seen from you, replaced by attitudes that
seemed very negative to me personally, and which were not justified by
anything I wrote.

Also, your message on the veil of transparency attributed a belief to me
that you understood at the time I did not claim as my own, as shown in the
following exchange  posted later:

JA: Notice what you just said, by way of stating this POV:
JA:
JA: "ontologies are supposed to be about things that exist"
JA:
JA: You have just told me what (you believe)
JA: an ontology is "supposed" to be "about" --
JA: you have not told me what an ontology is --
JA: unless what it is reduces to the question
JA: of what it is "supposed" to be "about".
JA: Is that not an interesting observation?

PJ: It is a mistaken observation.
PJ: I merely tried to summarize three points of view.
PJ: I did not say that I personally suppose an ontology
PJ: can only be about things that exist.

JA: I understood that part -- hence the hedge:  "by way of stating
JA: this POV" -- but staking out the nuances of your estimable
JA: propositional attitude and distributing it throughout the whole
JA: discussion would have led me to use an order of circumlocution
JA: that is beyond my powers and level of comfort.

I felt it was a serious mistake on your part to knowingly say that I
believed something which you understood I did not say I believed. The reason
you gave for doing this amounted to a difficulty in writing on your part.
(This was also surprising, given the strong literary faculties that you have
frequently demonstrated.)

Anyway, enough said. I appreciate your apology. I hope that we can start
fresh, move forward and put all of this behind us.

Sincerely,

Phil Jackson
