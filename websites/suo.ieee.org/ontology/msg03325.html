HP = Howard Pattee 
JA = Jon Awbrey

JA: I know the meaning of the word &quot;linear&quot;.

JA: Maybe it would help to back up and to try to tackle one dimension at a time -- 

HP: If you could tackle one dimension at a time without regard to the other dimensions,
    that would mean tackling it linearly.  (I doubt that this is a linearizable discussion.)

It's just a heuristic, not a categorical imperative.
Sometimes it works real nice, and sometimes not.
It just seemed to me like &quot;informal/formal&quot; was
the dimension that has been coming up the most
often and blocking all progress in the other
directions -- then again, maybe it's just
that a whole section of my dissertation
is devoted to the tension along the
lines between informal and formal.

HP: I am disappointed that you think our differences might degenerate to
    a mere matter of style.  I was quite sure our brains have different
    operating systems.  I am interested in these differences.

JA: I said nothing about our differences.  I said something about the differences
    between two samples of text.  I write many different sorts of text, so do you.
    The differences between these textile samplers, that makes us call one of them
    less formal and one of them more formal, are comparative, complex, and relative,
    and do not justify drawing any kind of absolutely simple dichotomy. Semiotics
    is partly a concern with the transformation of texts from one genre to another.
    From my point of view, the account that I gave of what &quot;linear&quot; means is much
    clearer, in the sense that it supports effective technical discussion, and so
    I prefer it for that purpose.  Perhaps you prefer yours for the same purpose,
    perhaps you prefer it for some other purpose.  A person is not one purpose.

HP: I agree your formal definition of &quot;linear&quot; is clearer
    than mine in the context of linear algebras.

Also in category theory, where we speak of morphisms,
reminding me of another equivalent that I strangely
enough forgot to mention last time:  representation.

The following are semantically equivalent in some sense (TFASEISS):

| analogy
| arrow
| distributive
| example
| icon
| idol
| linear
| model
| morphism
| paradigm
| preservative
| representation

HP: Let me try to explain my purposes (relating physical laws, living organisms,
    and semiotics).  I find there are fundamental dichotomies.  I am not sure
    if their roots are ontological, epistemic, semiotic, or neurological, but
    that is not currently a decidable issue.  There is an essential dichotomy
    between text structure and dynamic physical laws.  Text structures are
    one dimensional, discrete, time- and rate-independent sequences.

Semiotics is broader than linguistics, in one sense,
and it is even broader than logic, in another sense.

Not all signs are text structures, at least, not of this min-dim sort.
You can call them text structures if you wish, but only by braodening
the scope of text structures to be as wide as these signs are already.

I am a material and a physical thinker.  Everything that is and that happens,
including semiosis, has a material and a physical aspect, even though our
job in a given study, like logic, may be to focus on its formal aspects.
There is no conflict, no dichotomy, no cartesian dualism needed here.

HP: Laws are expressed by texts, but interpreted as three-dimensional,
    continuous, time- and rate-dependent dynamics.

Laws are expressed in signs, which can be any sort of thing
that one interprets as a sign, for example, the rock at the
corner of my lot that signifies my legal right to a certain
piece of real estate.

HP: All texts, languages, formal logics and much mathematics
    (&quot;formal&quot; here excludes arrays and diagrams) ...

No, it does not, not if they have form, and they most certainly do.

HP: All texts, languages, formal logics and much mathematics
    (&quot;formal&quot; here excludes arrays and diagrams), genes, and
    covalently bonded copolymer macromolecules that make up
    living organisms, are structurally (not functionally or
    semantically) one-dimensional (linear), discrete strings.
    This linearity of speech and text is one of its most
    distinguishing universal characteristics.
    Why is this?

The question is rather:  Why do you think this?

HP: Turing (and many others, e.g., Poincare, Post, von Neumann, Lenneberg,
    Z. Harris, Hockett, Simon) have pointed out that the construction and
    manipulation of text structure can be done efficiently and precisely only
    if the individual units or symbol structures allow &quot;immediate recognisability&quot;
    and &quot;simple operations&quot; (Turing, &quot;On computable numbers ...&quot; etc.).  In other
    words, one must be able to read and write individual symbols without at the same
    time paying attention to, or altering other symbols.  (Perception and measurement
    have this same requirement. One must be able to observe or measure something without
    measuring or disturbing everything else.)  I believe there is evolutionary and historical
    evidence that this decomposability of text structure is the conceptual basis, or precursor
    of the precise type of linearity which you formalized in the context of linear algebras.

These ideas come out of Fregean notions of semantics
and Hilbert's prescription of Finitism cum Formalism.
Not all of these ideas are necessarily tied together
in precisely this way.

HP: That is what I meant by my somewhat cryptic assertion that
    &quot;most formal systems try to be linear and nearly succeed&quot;.
    Linear algebra succeeds very well.  The reason &quot;most physical
    systems also try&quot; is just for the same basic reason that it
    is easiest and most precise to read and write decomposable,
    linear symbol structures.  In physics these expressions
    &quot;usually fail&quot; just because Nature is not fundamentally
    decomposable, although fortunately for practical life
    it is partially decomposable.

I understand that linear maps, morphisms, transformations,
&quot;representations&quot; in the algebraic sense, are a very important
and useful class of functions from object domains to sign domains,
when you can get them, when you can get them approximately, when
you can get them locally, and when you can patch them together
in order to describe something that isn't itself linear,
but that is about all that one can say here.

HP: My final point was that no matter how neat and linear the symbol structures
    may be (DNA, texts, and all that) their functions (interpretations, meanings)
    are generally nonlinear.  That is, we can no longer look at one nucleotide in
    DNA, one amino acid residue in a protein, one neuron, or one word in a sentence
    (or one of three massive bodies) and make much sense of what they are meaningfully
    doing in the context of any intepretant system.

Much as I love puns, I simply cannot seriously use the
words &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;non-linear&quot; as you just did in this
paragraph -- I would have to use &quot;sequential&quot; or &quot;serial&quot;
instead of &quot;linear&quot; -- as it would wreak utter havoc with
their mathematical uses and cut me off from communicating
with whole communities who use them in mathematical ways.

HP: I hope this gives you a few more clues about my purposes and problems.

Yes.

Jon
