&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was not intending to suggest that there
&gt; &gt; &gt; should be an axiomatisation of immateriality
&gt; &gt; &gt; (or space) in the 'holes theory'.  Merely that its
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'dependence' on immateriality should be noted somehow.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think we both agree that the upper ontology should
&gt; &gt; &gt; contain the material/immaterial distinction
&gt; &gt; &gt; (if it is going to be anywhere).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Chrises,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this im/material distinction the same
&gt; &gt; as Aristotle's "form/matter" distinction?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Interjection by Pat:
&gt; 
&gt; Probably not.  But why did you ask?
&gt; What would depend on the answer?

Oh, My Soul.

&gt; Aristotle wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; | a.  The theories of the soul (psyche)
&gt; |     handed down by our predecessors have
&gt; |     been sufficiently discussed;  now let
&gt; |     us start afresh, as it were, and try to
&gt; |     determine (diorisai) what the soul is,
&gt; |     and what definition (logos) of it will
&gt; |     be most comprehensive (koinotatos).
&gt; |
&gt; | b.  We describe one class of existing things as
&gt; |     substance (ousia), and this we subdivide into
&gt; |     three:  (1) matter (hyle), which in itself is
&gt; |     not an individual thing, (2) shape (morphe) or
&gt; |     form (eidos), in virtue of which individuality
&gt; |     is directly attributed, and (3) the compound
&gt; |     of the two.
&gt; |
&gt; | c.  Matter is potentiality (dynamis), while form is
&gt; |     realization or actuality (entelecheia), and the
&gt; |     word actuality is used in two senses, illustrated
&gt; |     by the possession of knowledge (episteme) and the
&gt; |     exercise of it (theorein).
&gt; |
&gt; | d.  Bodies (somata) seem to be pre-eminently
&gt; |     substances, and most particularly those
&gt; |     which are of natural origin (physica),
&gt; |     for these are the sources (archai)
&gt; |     from which the rest are derived.
&gt; |
&gt; | e.  But of natural bodies some have life (zoe)
&gt; |     and some have not;  by life we mean the
&gt; |     capacity for self-sustenance, growth,
&gt; |     and decay.
&gt; |
&gt; | f.  Every natural body (soma physikon), then,
&gt; |     which possesses life must be substance, and
&gt; |     substance of the compound type (synthete).
&gt; |
&gt; | g.  But since it is a body of a definite kind, viz.,
&gt; |     having life, the body (soma) cannot be soul (psyche),
&gt; |     for the body is not something predicated of a subject,
&gt; |     but rather is itself to be regarded as a subject,
&gt; |     i.e., as matter.
&gt; |
&gt; | h.  So the soul must be substance in the sense of being
&gt; |     the form of a natural body, which potentially has life.
&gt; |     And substance in this sense is actuality.
&gt; |
&gt; | i.  The soul, then, is the actuality of the kind of body we
&gt; |     have described.  But actuality has two senses, analogous
&gt; |     to the possession of knowledge and the exercise of it.
&gt; |
&gt; | j.  Clearly (phaneron), actuality in our present sense
&gt; |     is analogous to the possession of knowledge;  for both
&gt; |     sleep (hypnos) and waking (egregorsis) depend upon the
&gt; |     presence of the soul, and waking is analogous to the
&gt; |     exercise of knowledge, sleep to its possession (echein)
&gt; |     but not its exercise (energein).
&gt; |   
&gt; | k.  Now in one and the same person the
&gt; |     possession of knowledge comes first.
&gt; |
&gt; | l.  The soul may therefore be defined as the first actuality
&gt; |     of a natural body potentially possessing life;  and such
&gt; |     will be any body which possesses organs (organikon).
&gt; |
&gt; | m.  The parts of plants are organs too, though very
&gt; |     simple ones:  e.g., the leaf protects the pericarp,
&gt; |     and the pericarp protects the seed;  the roots are
&gt; |     analogous to the mouth, for both these absorb food.
&gt; |
&gt; | n.  If then one is to find a definition which will apply
&gt; |     to every soul, it will be "the first actuality of
&gt; |     a natural body possessed of organs".
&gt; |
&gt; | o.  So one need no more ask (zetein) whether body and
&gt; |     soul are one than whether the wax (keros) and the
&gt; |     impression (schema) it receives are one, or in
&gt; |     general whether the matter of each thing is
&gt; |     the same as that of which it is the matter;
&gt; |     for admitting that the terms unity and being
&gt; |     are used in many senses, the paramount (kyrios)
&gt; |     sense is that of actuality.
&gt; |
&gt; | p.  We have, then, given a general definition
&gt; |     of what the soul is:  it is substance in
&gt; |     the sense of formula (logos), i.e., the
&gt; |     essence of such-and-such a body.
&gt; |
&gt; | q.  Suppose that an implement (organon), e.g. an axe,
&gt; |     were a natural body;  the substance of the axe
&gt; |     would be that which makes it an axe, and this
&gt; |     would be its soul;  suppose this removed, and
&gt; |     it would no longer be an axe, except equivocally.
&gt; |     As it is, it remains an axe, because it is not of
&gt; |     this kind of body that the soul is the essence or
&gt; |     formula, but only of a certain kind of natural body
&gt; |     which has in itself a principle of movement and rest.
&gt; |
&gt; | r.  We must, however, investigate our definition
&gt; |     in relation to the parts of the body.
&gt; |
&gt; | s.  If the eye were a living creature, its soul would be
&gt; |     its vision;  for this is the substance in the sense
&gt; |     of formula of the eye.  But the eye is the matter
&gt; |     of vision, and if vision fails there is no eye,
&gt; |     except in an equivocal sense, as for instance
&gt; |     a stone or painted eye.
&gt; |
&gt; | t.  Now we must apply what we have found true of the part
&gt; |     to the whole living body.  For the same relation must
&gt; |     hold good of the whole of sensation to the whole sentient
&gt; |     body qua sentient as obtains between their respective parts.
&gt; |
&gt; | u.  That which has the capacity to live is not the body
&gt; |     which has lost its soul, but that which possesses
&gt; |     its soul;  so seed and fruit are potentially bodies
&gt; |     of this kind.
&gt; |
&gt; | v.  The waking state is actuality in the same sense as the
&gt; |     cutting of the axe or the seeing of the eye, while the
&gt; |     soul is actuality in the same sense as the faculty of
&gt; |     the eye for seeing, or of the implement for doing its
&gt; |     work.
&gt; | w.  The body is that which exists potentially;  but just as
&gt; |     the pupil and the faculty of seeing make an eye, so in
&gt; |     the other case the soul and body make a living creature.
&gt; |
&gt; | x.  It is quite clear, then, that neither the soul nor
&gt; |     certain parts of it, if it has parts, can be separated
&gt; |     from the body;  for in some cases the actuality belongs
&gt; |     to the parts themselves.  Not but what there is nothing
&gt; |     to prevent some parts being separated, because they are
&gt; |     not actualities of any body.
&gt; |
&gt; | y.  It is also uncertain (adelon) whether the soul as an
&gt; |     actuality bears the same relation to the body as the
&gt; |     sailor (ploter) to the ship (ploion).
&gt; |
&gt; | z.  This must suffice as an attempt to determine
&gt; |     in rough outline the nature of the soul.
&gt; 
&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a study aid to assist with the reading of
&gt; the text.  What I think is especially relevant to
&gt; our purposes -- aside from the content of these
&gt; fundamental categories or "basemental concepts"
&gt; that echo in the everyday constitutions of our
&gt; minds and still support, if a bit contingently,
&gt; the greater parts of our thinking even today --
&gt; is the method that Aristotle uses, working through
&gt; analogy and prototype, or the well-chosen example,
&gt; to articulate, build, construe, derive, and apply,
&gt; in a recursive process, his system of abstractions.
&gt; 
&gt; So consider the following "Alignments of Capacities"
&gt; as you read Aristotle's text:
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt;        Matter       |            Form
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt;     Potentiality    |          Actuality
&gt;     Receptivity     |  Possession  |   Exercise
&gt;        Life         |    Sleep     |    Waking
&gt;        Wax          |          Impression
&gt;        Axe          |    Edge      |   Cutting
&gt;        Eye          |   Vision     |    Seeing
&gt;        Body         |            Soul
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt;        Ship?        |           Sailor?
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Bon Voyage!
