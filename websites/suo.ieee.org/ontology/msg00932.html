Hi Chris

&gt;There are two possible theses here (as I mentioned in my earlier attachment
&gt;on ontological architecture <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03131.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg03131.html</A> ).
&gt;A strong thesis - that every occurrent has a unique continuant of which it
&gt;is the life. This seems to lead to an ontology with a built-in redundancy,
&gt;and if you think parsimony is a sensible goal, then there is an opportunity
&gt;to perform an ontological reduction.
&gt;A weak thesis - that every occurrent is composed of the continuants that
&gt;participate in it.

I know people who would reject both of these, I think, but would 
claim that every continuant has a unique occurrent called its 
lifetime. Your strong thesis seems unncessarily strong. As I 
understand the occ/cont contrast (from Peter Simons), the basic idea 
is the continuant: occurrents are defined as everything else, so the 
set of occurrents is distinctly more ramshackle than that of 
continuants. There might be very loose, disorganised occurrents (like 
a war, say) which can't be identified with a single continuant.
Nicola and others have insisted that the identity conditions for 
occurrents must involve reference to continuants which provide a kind 
of 'stitching' through time, or else they (the occurrents) would just 
kind of dissolve into a temporal mist, but that doesnt require there 
to be a single continuant. And even the weak thesis seems a bit 
shaky: isnt a war rather more than just the participants, even if 
they do provide the ontological glue which makes in into a single 
happening?

&gt;I suspect that you are 'becoming comfortable' with the weak thesis, though
&gt;your examples seem to support the strong thesis.
&gt;
&gt;There are attractive examples illustrating both theses.
&gt;However there also plausible commonsense counterexamples to both theses. Pat
&gt;has mention a flame and ocean wave as counter-examples of the first thesis.
&gt;A flash of light can be seen as a counter-example of the strong thesis.
&gt;
&gt;Secondly - your concerns about part_of are well-founded:
&gt;If you are a Endurantist (and so hold a continuant-occurrent distinction)
&gt;then you regard the inter-categorical relation as participates not part. If
&gt;you are a Perdurantist (and do not hold the distinction - but may recognize
&gt;a related body-event distinction) you can regard the participates relation
&gt;as overlapping or sharing temporal parts. It all depends upon the choice
&gt;that you make in you ontological architecture. In neither case are
&gt;continuants (bodies) parts of occurrents (events) simpliciter - whether or
&gt;not you are extensionalist.

Really? Seems to me that if one is a 4-d extensionalist (which I am 
on odd-numbered days of the month) then there really is no basic 
distinction between thing and event, and then your last claim is 
false. For example consider my liver (a body, in this terminology) 
and the event consisting of my lifetime.  Barring future medical 
disasters, the 4-d extension of the former is entirely inside that of 
the latter, so an extensionalist would have to say it is part of it. 
Just apply the mereotopological notion of 'part' to the relevant 
chunks of 4-space; you can't get much more simpliciter than that.
