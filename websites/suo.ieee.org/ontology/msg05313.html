ICE.  Discussion Note 27

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

A split second after the B^3 equivalent of a Big Bang,
the universe X% = [b, c, r] leaves behind its mannerism
without qualities and undergoes a Red shift that renders
its Red a dyed-in-the-wool, honest-to-logic Color, which
is to say, there is a logical collapse of those regions
of the universe that would otherwise counter-exemplify
the imposition of the implication Red =&gt; Color, which
I will record as ( Red ( Color )) and encourage you
to read as &quot;Not Red Without Color&quot;.  See the film:

Figure 5.  Imposition of the Constraint ( Red ( Color ))

By way of explanation, the conjunction r (c), read r &amp; ~c,
when negated produces the implication (r (c)), read r =&gt; c.
If one views the venn diagram as a soap-film on a wire-frame,
it is just as if one punctures the regions of film that are
to be excluded from the universe of discourse, after which
one observes that all the film marked Red is contained in
the region marked Color.
