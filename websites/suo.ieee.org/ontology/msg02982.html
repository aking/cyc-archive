Jon Awbrey wrote (JA):

JA: It all depends on how various observers define their sundry ductions, of
course.
    I kept up with the automated concept formation and machine learning
literature
    pretty tightly until about 1992, tapering off through 1996, and since
then it
    has been &quot;Back to Peirce&quot; all the way.  As you know, there was a
development
    in his thinking about the precise structure of the triductive inquiry
cycle,
    though I regard the metamorphosis to be rather more natural and far less
    radical than some writers make it out to be.  Moreover, this evolution
    was confluent with a general turn that was taking place throughout the
    differentiating fields of mathematics throughout the 19th Century.
    Accordingly, my strategy has been to try and follow these changes
    with some care, however long and meandering a course it may be,
    recapitulating in my gradation the phases of Peirce's transit.
    Right now, I am still trying to establish a footing in the
    syllogistic camp that was already staked out by Aristotle.

JC: Thanks.  That helps explain to me better a lot
    of what you put up on the Complexity list.

JA: When it comes to automating abductive reasoning, we should
    observe the historical circumstance that it is often the most
    &quot;unlikely&quot; set of hypotheses that turn out to form the correct
    conceptual framework, at least when that likelihood has been
    judged from the standpoint of the previous framework.

JC: Well, the likely ones have probably already been explored.

JA: It's more than that, as what usually happens, when regarded
retrospectively --
    from a &quot;Monday Morning Quarterback POV&quot; -- is that the whole reference
class,
    sample space, and array of random variables that explicitly or
implicitly
    give one a sense of the odds of things in general has been altered in
    a way that was just not assignable a likelihood from the preterite
    frame of reference.  This is just one of the reasons why a person
    cannot do abduction the Bayesian way, no matter how many vehicles
    get cranked out with &quot;Abduction&quot; in the headers but nothing but
    Bayes in the bonnet.

JC: I see your point here.  The word &quot;Bayesian&quot; tends to trigger
    a deep instinctive negative response in me, and I have to
    remind myself, &quot;It's just a theorem, John;  its range of
    application is conditional.&quot;

Exactly.  I remember it more as the flip-side of a definition, but maybe
that's
what most theorems are, the gratuitously porismatic &quot;corollarial&quot; kind.  And
it's
a perfectly beautiful and useful device if one does not try to use it for
the wrong
job, or let one's enthusiasm with it extend to the point where one is
tempted to claim,
dogmatically reductively, that what it cannot dis-pense is not to be thought
of or even
to be weighed at all in the balance of one's examination.

JC: Kuhn thought that normal science works primarily by analogy,
    not deduction or enumerative induction.  This is a matter of
    finding the Aristotelian &quot;middle term&quot;. The difficult abductive
    step involves rather more than this, since the first and last terms
    are also open.

JA: Not sure.  I'm still in the muddle o' medias res myself.
    But I do have a passel of charts and graphs on this bit,
    which you just know you're gonna get to see.  But just
    for teaser of coming attractions, look at this picture:

JA: We usually think of each duction as being produced from a vertext
    to its opposite side, thinking of the vertex as an index of its
    two incident considerations, which correspond to the premisses
    of the inference in question.  But suppose that we contemplate
    the possibility of a reasoning process F that takes a Fact ZX
    and produces a middle term Y, in effect, posing the Rule ZY
    and the Case YX at a single moment.  More on this later.

JC: If Z and X are fixed points (as they would be in the everyday
interpretation
    of objective fact), then this would be a model of what I was talking
about.
    If Z and X, however, are facts interpreted from some perspective, then
this
    would still be a model of what I was talking about, though it opens up
the
    possibility of hierarchies of more and less observables (similar to
Quine),
    and multiple levels of possible misunderstanding.

When I use this ancient scheme, attaching its medieval labels
of &quot;Case&quot;, &quot;Fact&quot;, &quot;Rule&quot;, I will always try to remember to
capitalize these quaint terms of art, so as not to confuse
them with their more common usage.  So the points X, Y, Z
represent 'terms', while the edges represent 'propositions',
reading Case YX, Fact ZX, Rule ZY in the following ways as
implications or as predications, according to one's taste.

¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
| Proposition       | Case YX | Fact ZX | Rule ZY |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
| Predication       |  Y of X |  Z of X |  Z of Y |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
| Implication       | (X (Y)) | (X (Z)) | (Y (Z)) |
|                   |         |         |         |
|                   |  X=&gt;Y   |  X=&gt;Z   |  Y=&gt;Z   |
¤~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Off course, if we follow that turn in 19th Century formal thinking
to which I adverted, and to which I am recursively returning, then
all of these fixtures of the roles that are being played here will
tend to get relativized beyond the paradigm of absolute fixations.

JC: On reflection, even the objective case permits this sort of hierarchy.
    It is wonder that anyone can communicate with anyone else at all, or
    even with themselves.  Quine noticed this, and went for a reduced sense
    of meaning that eliminated the variability.

Yes, the hard case of translation is within a single language.
I dubbed it the &quot;Radical Indeterminacy Of Translation&quot; (RIOT).

JC: Donald Davidson argued for the &quot;principle of charity&quot; ...

I think that Saint Augustine beat him to it,
but there may've been 1, 2, 3 others before.

JC: ... so that the maximal part of the variability comes out true
    for each person individually.  Kuhn and Feyerabend argued that
    the historical evidence shows people don't always think like
    Davidson recommends, and argued furthermore that they don't
    have the resources to do so (&quot;resources&quot; is my terminology
    for interpretive capacity that is discussed in various terms
    by Kuhn and Feyerabend).  Resources are always pragmatic, and
    get missed if we focus on semantics alone.

Yes, I would be tempted to agree, even before I know for sure
whether you use &quot;pragmatic&quot; and &quot;semantic&quot; with the same sense
that I have in mind.

JC: In either case, the model above seems to me not to fall afoul
    of the sort of thing Howard raised in his recent post, but it
    doesn't seem to me to accommodate them either, except perhaps
    implicitly via what you said about ontologies and theories,
    which was phrased in a way I have difficulty understanding.

I am still trying to work through that.

JC: Theories have ontological commitments, but aren't ontologies
    resources out of which one selects ontological commitments?

I guess I believe that even a language, a conceptual system,
or a POV -- what I call a &quot;frame of reference&quot; (FOR) -- has
an ontological bias or warp to it.  Much fun was had by all
on the SUO List over this one, but you can probably guess
how it went, much like it always goes.  Fora sample:

| An Ontologically Neutral Message

The trail of the human serpent may slither over all,
but the &quot;God's Eye View&quot; (GeV) still seizes the day.

JC: It seems quite possible to me that a theory has a restricted set of
    ontological commitments, but that a holder of the theory might have
    quite a more broad ontology, and is just playing it on the safe side.
    A lot of theories aren't that specific about their ontologies, and
    it is only through practice and interpretation and a lot of time
    that the ontological commitments of the theory get fixed (largely
    by tacit means).

Pursuing the analogous point about the language in which the theory
is expressed, I would say that even if the language (cum ideal POV)
embodies ontological assumptions, they are not always as fixed as
they may appear in a given interpretation of the most basic signs.
Just for example, think about the &quot;Entitative&quot; and the &quot;Existential&quot;
interpretations of Peirce's Logical Graphs, EnG and ExG, respectively.
In the RefLog version of it, the abstract expression &quot;((x)(y))&quot; enjoys
a dual interpretation:

| Under EnG, &quot;((x)(y))&quot; means &quot;not [not x or not y]&quot;, that is, &quot;x and y&quot;.
|
| Under ExG, &quot;((x)(y))&quot; means &quot;not [not x and not y]&quot;, that is, &quot;x or y&quot;.

JC: One thing that worries me about making ontologies of theories relative
    to the theory is that it seems to make failure of communication
impossible
    to avoid or resolve.  If we allow only that a theory's ontological
commitments
    are specific, then they may be seen as a selection from ontology in
general,
    and theories with differing ontological commitments can be seen to
differ
    in specific ways against a background ontology.  At least the
possibility
    of seeing them that way is there.

This is a sticky wicket, of course.  What comes to mind right off the bat is
this:
If we take up the pitch of Locke and Peirce that logic is but a special
branch of
semiotic, its formal and normative specie if I take them aright, then it may
not
handle the problem, to say we end, but it does afford us a bit more elbow
room,
in that we can size up the lay of language before we enter the fray of
theory.

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
