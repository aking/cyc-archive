Dear Chris,

Thanks again for the responses.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some more questions and comments.
&gt; 
&gt; Appreciated, as always.  Thanks for the careful look.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Under class, relation is defined as a class.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it is the class of relations.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Later under relation you define class as a unary relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Right, unlike, say, the OWNERSHIP relation, CLASS is not a 
&gt; relation that
&gt; holds among several things, but is true only of single things (namely,
&gt; classes).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This seems to be inconsistent.
&gt; 
&gt; It is quite consistent.  You seem to be confusing the claim that
&gt; RELATION itself is a class with the (false) claim that 
&gt; relations (i.e.,
&gt; the instances of the class RELATION) are classes.
&gt; 
MW: Yes.

&gt; &gt; 2. &lt; applies only to integers. Why doesn't it apply to 
&gt; reals or (at least)
&gt; &gt; rationals?
&gt; 
&gt; Reals and rationals are not axiomatized in the ontology, so, as in the
&gt; ontology as it stands, &lt; only holds between integers.  The axiom for &lt;
&gt; would have to be modified if you introduced further number systems and
&gt; you wanted &lt; to be polymorphic.

MW: OK. Can you do that? How do you remove axioms in KIF, is there a way of
first saying something and then saying something else? Or do you just use
the delete key
in your chosen editor?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. &lt; is not defined (not that I have any idea how to do 
&gt; it). By which
&gt; &gt; I mean what being less than is.
&gt; 
&gt; What being less than *is* is exactly what the axioms tell us it is.
&gt; For primitive terms like "&lt;", this is what you get instead of a
&gt; definition.  (In a true definition, the defined term is eliminable;
&gt; anything expressed in terms of the defined term can be 
&gt; expressed without
&gt; it, albeit more verbosely, in terms of the primitives of the 
&gt; language.)

MW: Ah! (Ray of light shines down from the heavens)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. I can't get the axiom for addition (or subtraction). 
&gt; Here is my attempt
&gt; &gt; at an English translation - where have I gone wrong?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For all integers i and j
&gt; &gt;   i+0=0 and  &lt;-- I think this should be i+0=i
&gt; 
&gt; Whoops, yes, serious typo; thanks for catching that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   i+(j+1)= i+j+1 and
&gt; &gt;   i+(j-1)= i+j+1
&gt; 
&gt; Don't confuse the sum of some number i and the number 1 with the
&gt; application of the (primitive) successor operator "+1".  The idea here
&gt; is to axiomatize addition and subtraction in terms of 
&gt; addition in terms
&gt; of the two successor "+1" and predecessor "-1".  (Maybe it would be
&gt; better to use, e.g., the terms "scssr" and "prdssr" or the 
&gt; like here for
&gt; these operators to avoid confusion.)  There are only three cases to
&gt; consider:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The case where we add 0 to a number i;
&gt; 2. The case where we add the successor (+1 j) of a number j to i; and
&gt; 3. The case where we add the predecesor (-1 j) of a number j to i.
&gt; 
&gt; The base clause (= (+ i 0) i) gives us the first case.  The clause
&gt; 
&gt;                 (= (+ ?i (+1 ?j)) (+1 (+ ?i ?j)))
&gt; 
&gt; gives us case 2; it says that the sum of i and the successor 
&gt; of a number
&gt; j is the successor of the sum and i and j.  So if we know the sum of i
&gt; and j, we can calculate the sum of i and the successor of j.  
&gt; Similarly,
&gt; case 3 is given by the last clause:
&gt; 
&gt;                  (= (+ ?i (-1 ?j)) (-1 (+ ?i ?j))))))
&gt; 
&gt; which says that the sum of i and the predecessor of a number j is the
&gt; predecessor of the sum of i and j.  Eventually, due to the recursive
&gt; nature of the axioms, you will be able to unpack any sum in terms of
&gt; a finite number of successive operations of successor and predecessor
&gt; (and hence,, in virtue of the Cancellation Axiom, successive 
&gt; operations
&gt; of *either* successor or predecessor only).  Try, for example, to show
&gt; that (= (+ 2 3) 5) (using the definitions of "2", "3", and "5" given).

MW: Thanks that helps a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; phew so all those years using reverse polish notation on HP 
&gt; programmable
&gt; &gt; calculators did have a point :-)
&gt; 
&gt; And you thought that was wasted effort!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 6. Sequences
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a) Here you find a need to introduce extensionality for 
&gt; some classes like
&gt; &gt; sequence.
&gt; 
&gt; Sequences aren't classes, 

MW: Aren't they?

(documentation "AXIOM (roughly put): The `instance-of' predicate is
dispensable in favor of standard function/argument notation.")

(forall (?cls ?x (class ?cls))
        (&lt;=&gt; (instance-of ?x ?cls)
             (?cls ?x)))

I thought this said that they were, because sequence is used in the
predicate position.

&gt; but yes, they are axiomatized to be 
&gt; extensional.
&gt; (They didn't *have* to be, but it is definitely simpler to make this
&gt; assumption.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Robert has suggested they should also be necessary for Top, or else
&gt; &gt; there is no reason for Top to be unique.
&gt; 
&gt; I think we've cleared that one up.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is starting to look to me as if it would be better to introduce a
&gt; &gt; "property" like class that can be non-extensional, and a 
&gt; "set" like class
&gt; &gt; that is extensional before we get to this point.
&gt; 
&gt; Quite possibly.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; b) on the one hand you say that a sequence holds only for positive
&gt; &gt; integers, and on the other hand you say that any object can be an
&gt; &gt; element of a sequence. Which is it?
&gt; 
&gt; You are not understanding.  A sequence is a (partial) 
&gt; *function* (i.e.,
&gt; a binary relation that is functional) that *applies* to positive
&gt; integers and which can have *any object* as value.  The elements of a
&gt; sequence are its values on the integers on which it is 
&gt; defined.  We say
&gt; that a sequence s is defined on n iff, for some object x, (s 
&gt; n x), i.e.,
&gt; n bears s to x.

MW: Thanks. I think I'm getting there.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; c)
&gt; &gt; (forall (?s)
&gt; &gt;         (=&gt; (sequence ?s)
&gt; &gt;             (and (relation ?s)
&gt; &gt;                  (binary ?s)
&gt; &gt;                  (functional ?s)
&gt; &gt;                  (exists (?n (posint n))  &lt;-- missing ?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, thanks.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;                          (and (not (exists (?x) (?s ?n ?x)))
&gt; &gt;                               (forall (?m (posint ?m) (&lt; ?m ?n))
&gt; &gt;                                       (exists (?x)
&gt; &gt;                                               (?s ?m ?x))))))))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My translation is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For all s:
&gt; &gt;   If s is a sequence then:
&gt; &gt;     s is a relation and
&gt; &gt;     s is binary and
&gt; &gt;     s is functional and
&gt; &gt;     for some positive integer n
&gt; &gt;       there is no x such that s(n,x) &lt;-- doesn't seem to have
&gt; &gt;                                          a defined meaning
&gt; 
&gt; It most certainly does.  As discussed at some length, you can 
&gt; use a term
&gt; both as a predicate and as a function symbol; the context serves to
&gt; disambiguate what is meant.  Sequences are introduced as (functional)
&gt; binary relations.  Hence, s(n,x) means that the sequence s 
&gt; holds between
&gt; the number n and the object x.  Alternatively, one can write s(n)=x,
&gt; though, for reasons explained in the introductory material, one should
&gt; do so only when one knows that s is defined on n.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;       and
&gt; &gt;       for all positive integers m where m&lt;n
&gt; &gt;         there is some x such that s(m,x) &lt;-- meaning?
&gt; 
&gt; As above.  Here's a terse English translation of the axiom:  if s is a
&gt; sequence, then it is a binary, functional relation that is defined on
&gt; some initial segment of the positive integers.  Here's a more verbose
&gt; version:  if s is a sequence, then it is a binary, functional relation
&gt; such that, for some positive integer n, s is defined on exactly the
&gt; positive integers less than n (i.e., for each such integer m, there is
&gt; an x such that s(m,x)).


MW: OK, I think with this (and the &lt;) I am getting there with this way of 
defining things. Just lack of experience on my part.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; c) you have used the term length to mean just the length of a
&gt; &gt; sequence. This means it cannot be used for e.g. length as a basic
&gt; &gt; dimension.
&gt; 
&gt; So let's use "seqlength" instead.  Let us not quibble.

MW: That is fine.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Aren't what you are defining here as sequences really tuples?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it is a precise rendering of the notion of an n-tuple.  It is not
&gt; the only possible rendering, it is simply a good -- and common -- one.

MW: A rose ... Is there a particular reason for choosing sequence over 
tuple as a name? Just curious, no axes.

      Matthew
