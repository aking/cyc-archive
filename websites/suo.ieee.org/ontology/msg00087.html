Pat,

Here is the subsection from my dissertation
that I was telling you about, in which I give
the construction of a combined or an integrated
sign relation from the data of those for A and B,
one which has the effect of disambiguating the
indexical tokens in the appropriate way.

Actually, I seem to have taken up a couple of
notational variants of this construction, which
I called the "attributed" and the "adequated"
sign relation for the interpreters A and B.

It's been a couple of years since I last looked at
this part of it, and I no longer like the sound of
these names, but here is enough to convey the idea.

Notes on notation:

A "SEC" is a "semiotic equivalence class".
A "SEP" is a "semiotic partition".
A "SEQ" is a "semiotic equation".
A "SER" is a "semiotic equivalence relation".

Angle brackets "&lt;...&gt;" are used to mark a subscript.

A caret "^" is used to mark a following superscript.

Subscripted square brackets in the form "[s]&lt;j&gt;" serve to
denote the SEC of the sign s under the sign relation R&lt;j&gt;.

A subscripted equal sign in the form "s =&lt;j&gt; t" serves to
indicate a SEQ between sign s and sign t for interpreter j.

Excerpt from "Inquiry Driven Systems:  An Inquiry Into Inquiry"

| 3.4.38  Considering the Source
|
| There are several ways to contemplate the supplementation of signs,
| the sorts of augmentation that are crucial to meaning in the case of
| indices.  Some approaches are analytic, in the sense that they regard
| signs as derivative compounds and try to break up the unitary concept of
| an individual sign into a congeries of seemingly more real, more actual, or
| more determinate sign instances.  Other approaches are synthetic, in the sense
| that they accept a given collection of signs at face value and try to reconstruct
| more objective realities through the formation of abstract categories on this basis.
|
| 1.  One analytic method takes it as a maxim for the logic of context that:
|
|     "Every sign or text is indexed by the context in which it occurs."
|
|     This means that all signs, including indices, are themselves indexed,
|     though initially only tacitly, by the objective situation, the syntactic
|     context, and the actual interpreter that makes use of them.
|
| To begin formalizing this brand of supplementation, it is necessary to mark
| salient aspects of the situational, contextual, and inclusively interpretive
| features of sign usage that were previously held tacit.  In effect, signs once
| regarded as primitive objects need to be newly analyzed as categorical abstractions
| that cover multitudes of existential sign instances or "signs in use" (SIU's).
|
| To develop these dimensions of the A and B dialogue, I will attempt to
| articulate these interpretive parameters of signs by means of subscripts
| or superscripts attached to the signs or their quotations, in this way
| constituting a brand of "attributed remarks" or "situated signs".
|
| The attribution of signs to their activating interpreters preserves
| the original object domain but produces an expanded syntactic domain,
| the set of "attributed signs", listed in the domains S = I as follows:
|
| O  =  {A, B},
|
| S  =  {"A"^A, "B"^A, "i"^A, "u"^A, "A"^B, "B"^B, "i"^B, "u"^B},
|
| I  =  {"A"^A, "B"^A, "i"^A, "u"^A, "A"^B, "B"^B, "i"^B, "u"^B}  =  S.
|
| Table 73 displays the results of indexing every sign of the dialogue
| between A and B with a superscript indicating its source or "exponent",
| namely, the interpreter who actively communicates or transmits the sign.
| Ostensibly, the operation of attribution produces two new sign relations
| for A and B, but it turns out that both sign relations have the same form
| and content, so a single Table will do.  The new sign relation generated
| by this operation will be denoted as "At(A, B)" and will be called the
| "attributed sign relation" for A and B.
|
| Table 73.  Attributed Sign Relation for Interpreters A &amp; B
|
|    Object   Sign   Interpretant
|   ------------------------------
|      A      "A"^A      "A"^A
|      A      "A"^A      "A"^B
|      A      "A"^A      "i"^A
|      A      "A"^A      "u"^B
|      A      "A"^B      "A"^A
|      A      "A"^B      "A"^B
|      A      "A"^B      "i"^A
|      A      "A"^B      "u"^B
|      A      "i"^A      "A"^A
|      A      "i"^A      "A"^B
|      A      "i"^A      "i"^A
|      A      "i"^A      "u"^B
|      A      "u"^B      "A"^A
|      A      "u"^B      "A"^B
|      A      "u"^B      "i"^A
|      A      "u"^B      "u"^B
|   ------------------------------
|      B      "B"^A      "B"^A
|      B      "B"^A      "B"^B
|      B      "B"^A      "i"^B
|      B      "B"^A      "u"^A
|      B      "B"^B      "B"^A
|      B      "B"^B      "B"^B
|      B      "B"^B      "i"^B
|      B      "B"^B      "u"^A
|      B      "i"^B      "B"^A
|      B      "i"^B      "B"^B
|      B      "i"^B      "i"^B
|      B      "i"^B      "u"^A
|      B      "u"^A      "B"^A
|      B      "u"^A      "B"^B
|      B      "u"^A      "i"^B
|      B      "u"^A      "u"^A
|   ------------------------------
|
| Thus informed, the SER for interpreter A yields the semantic equations:
|
|     ["A"^A]&lt;A&gt;    =    ["A"^B]&lt;A&gt;    =    ["i"^A]&lt;A&gt;    =    ["u"^B]&lt;A&gt;,
|
| or   "A"^A      =&lt;A&gt;    "A"^B      =&lt;A&gt;    "i"^A      =&lt;A&gt;    "u"^B.
|
| In comparison, the SER for interpreter B yields the semantic equations:
|
|     ["A"^A]&lt;B&gt;    =    ["A"^B]&lt;B&gt;    =     ["i"^A]&lt;B&gt;   =   ["u"^B]&lt;B&gt;,
|
| or   "A"^A      =&lt;B&gt;    "A"^B      =&lt;B&gt;     "i"^A     =&lt;B&gt;   "u"^B.
|
| Consequently, both SER's now induce the same semantic partition on S:
|
| {{"A"^A, "A"^B, "i"^A, "u"^B}, {"B"^A, "B"^B, "i"^B, "u"^A}}.
|
| By means of a simple attribution step a certain level of congruity has
| been reached in the community of interpretation constituted by A and B.
| This newfound agreement on what is abstractly a single SER means that
| its equivalence classes reconstruct the structure of the object domain
| within the parts of the SEP.  This allows a measure of objectivity or
| inter-subjectivity to be predicated of the sign-relation's representation.
|
| An instance of Y using "X" is considered to be an objective event,
| the kind of happening to which all suitably placed observers can point,
| and adverting to an occurrence of "X"^Y is more specific and less vague
| than resorting to instances of "X" as if being issued by anonymous sources.
| The situated sign "X"^Y comprises a "wider sign" than "X" in the sense that
| it takes in a broader field of view on the interpretive situation and provides
| more information about the context of use.  As to the reception of attributed
| remarks, the interpreter that can recognize signs of the form "X"^Y is one
| that knows what it means to "consider the source".

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
