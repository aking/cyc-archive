Dear David,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What worries me is that some of the pragmatic enthusiasts of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standardization have a very oversimplified vision of what the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problems are, and that they therefore are being led (or 
&gt; allowed) to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expect a lot more from the SUO than it can possibly 
&gt; deliver to them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone thinks of this as being like the choice of a standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; book-cataloging scheme, or a standard math notation, or 
&gt; a standard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paper size, then they really havnt understood what 
&gt; ontologies *are*.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; Matthew West replied:
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  I think this is the real concern.  I think you are right 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that some people here think we are going to make progress 
&gt; relatively
&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly (a year or two).  Whilst I hope we will achieve 
&gt; something in
&gt; &gt; &gt; a couple of years, the most likely result in that timescale is a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; better understanding of the size of problem we face.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; Jon Awbrey said:
&gt; &gt; Yes! 
&gt; &gt; You are right, Sir!  &lt;David Letterman doing Ed MacMahon voice&gt;
&gt; &gt; Say G'night E-verbody!  Drive Safely!
&gt; 
&gt; At the risk of sounding naive, and even optimistic, I would like to
&gt; suggest that if the only thing you see us accomplishing in the next
&gt; two years is to know that this is a huge project, perhaps we 
&gt; can cut short
&gt; the next two years worth of work and just agree right now that it is
&gt; big, really BIG, as well as hard, really HARD.

MW: This is not what I mean. What I do mean is that today I doubt if we have
a common understanding of the nature of the problems we face. I think this
is evidenced by the fact that we seem to have a wide range of ideas of what
the solution should look like, though we have reasonable agreement as to the
requirements for the SUO. This tells me that we have a range of different
start points, with a number of people with different contributions that the
rest of us need to understand. Think of it as each of us having a different
piece of the jigsaw, but at present we are the only ones who can see our
piece, yet somehow we have to put the whole jigsaw together. That means that
at present noone knows even how many pieces there are (how big the problem
is) never mind how the pieces fit together.

&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, in my mind, this doesn't get us much closer to 
&gt; our goal.
&gt; There are many people who take on large tasks, knowing they are large.

MW: Well this is the camp I am in. If I thought it was easy, I wouldn't be
here. The challenge is what makes it attractive. On the other hand I am
interested in REALLY solving the problem, not doing something cosmetic.

&gt; There are plenty of others who see how large a task is, and 
&gt; choose not 
&gt; to do it.  It is rare to find those who choose not to take on a task 
&gt; helping those who think it worthwhile.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume that anyone who is sending mail to this mailing list,
&gt; is interested in the existence of a Standard Upper Ontology.
&gt; The task is going backward from the goal to the actions necessary
&gt; to bring it into existence.

MW: Indeed, and the immediate problem is that we don't know what they are,
so we will probably muddle about for a bit (my guess is two years) until we
find out what they are. The worst outcome is that we THINK we know what they
are, but are wrong, and we do a lot of stuff that is down the wrong track.
Then what happens is a lot of denial (that we have done something
inappropriate) before we eventually end up exercising one of my favourite
aphorisms "there is never enough time to get it right first time, but there
is always time to do it again"
