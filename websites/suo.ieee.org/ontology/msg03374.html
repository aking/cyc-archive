HP = Howard Pattee
JA = Jon Awbrey

JA: This object was chosen precisely on account of its familiarity to most folks
    of a technical persuasion.  This means that you will already have a sense that
    there is an abstract object of some sort -- or maybe just that it makes some kind
    of sense to speak &quot;as if&quot; there existed such an object --

HP: Of a kind we may speak of as a &quot;formal&quot; object?

Yes, I think so.  But my ear detects a shade of a difference
between the sense of the &quot;formal&quot; in &quot;formal object&quot; and the
sense of the &quot;formal&quot; in &quot;formal language&quot; or &quot;formal system&quot;.
It seems that the first means &quot;object of a formal expression&quot;,
whereas the latter two uses mean &quot;made of formal expressions&quot;.
Anyway, I tend to think of &quot;formal or logical or mathematical&quot;
objects all in the same breath, and ever since my foundations
crisis, auld lang syne, never really bother too much anymore
about which came first, the logic or the math.

JA: Now I realize that some of the label languages may appear a bit byzantine,
    but these were worked out over a period of twenty years, derived and extended
    from basic material in Peirce's logical graphs, and they have been tailored to
    the task of achieving both human conceptual and machine computational efficency.

HP: Can a tailor make one suit stylishly (or efficiently) fit both brains and machines?

Short answer:  Why do you think it took twenty years?

Long answer:   If you try some time,
               you just might find
               that it grows on you
               over time ...

HP: I think programmable computers are prostheses for the brain.

Funny you should mention it, as a lot of this work was initially incited
by the casual observations I made and the discussions I used to have when
I would visit John Eulenberg's Artifical Language Lab in the 70's and 80's,
where a lot of the earliest work on &quot;augmented communication&quot; was going on.
My &quot;sequence learner&quot; program began as an idea for what would now be called
a &quot;proactive keyboard&quot;.  Yes, I mean &quot;proactive&quot;.

HP: They were designed to do well the things that brains do not do well,
    like the wheel was designed to do well what legs do not do well.
    Therefore, they all have completely different structures.

Again, it is important to remind ourselves, now and again, from time to timbuktu and back,
that we are not just talking about the bruise-blood-brain interface here.  We are talking
about language, which has its genesis as a naturally selected gene-based organ, but had
already started taking on layers of nurtually engrained epigentic prosthesis almost as
soon as that &quot;genotype delivery device&quot; known as the &quot;phenotype&quot; that disported it
got itself muscled up enough to break a twig off the old home tree and thus create
a computer for itself (L: putare = to prune, reckon, think, Gk: paiein = to strike).
On top of that we have symbolic logic, which Aristotle first implemented in the
mesoderm of his 'Organon' (handbook, instrument, toolbox), and so this logic
has been a cultured intellectual pearl for as long as anybody can remember.
It's still biological, but we are talking quarterhorses here, selection,
sure, but selection of a most artifactual, if not auto-factitious kind.

To wit, as Ashby wot, the brain is a prosthesis for the body (the essential variables).
Aristotle thought it was a radiator, a cooling system.  I call it a &quot;theorem-o-stat&quot;.

HP: Michael Conrad's &quot;tradeoff principle&quot; is a good argument that programmability,
    efficiency, and evolvability (creativity) are incompatible in one type of structure
    (e.g., Conrad, &quot;The brain-machine disanalogy&quot; BioSystems 22, 197-213, 1989).

The motto you mention is very familiar to me, as I was up against it for years.
I learned a lot about why empiricist minds and rationalist minds, even those
that happen to inhabit the same body, have so much trouble communicating:
their rote modes of thinking have led to the creation of data structures
that are optimized in ways that trade-off discrepantly and have become
almost, not quite yet, incompatible.  I got to watch this happening
in the development cycles of the programs I wrote, and so it is
a very concrete phenomenon to me.

But the motto you mention is just like any number of heuristic slogans that
people form and use as guides.  It represents a post hoc rationalization
for why something keeps happening a certain way, like why something you
tried in every way you can think of just keeps failing to work out.
Heuristic principles are indispensable, in the mean time, anyway,
but each has its symmetric anti-maxim, as it is in the very
nature of approximate truths to have.  I happen to know
a few ways around this one.

Jon Awbrey
