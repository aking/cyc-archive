Jim, 
	.	This has turned into a suggested set of alterations to the
SUO group methods of working. I believe these are pragmatic ways of
overcoming the recent hiatus that has obstructed our progress. You may like
to consider the approaches suggested below as ways of improving the SUO
development process. 


Matthew et al, 
	.		I will provide a brief note, in numerical order, on
each of the 3 e-mails below: 

	.	RE: #3 "Flawed Approach: So long as Ian Niles is
co-ordinating (and actually doing) the work, I suggest the structure of the
basis is, de facto, under his control, taking into account the input from
the rest of us. If we get to a stage where someone actually suggests a
different structure (absolute silence so far .......), and Ian rejects it on
a basis the majority of us disagree with, then this issue could be worth
revisiting. 

	.	At present, Ian is showing worthwhile effort , and is
genuinely adapting participants comments in a reasonable way, including
taking note when there is reaction to solution paths he has developed in the
absence of guidance or when he has attempted to rationalise things himself. 

	.	An important aspect that Ian should continue to do, is
advising the group of every change that he makes on his own initiative, so
that their merits can be considered in the light of the breadth of
experience of the other group members. 

Proposed Solution: 
	.	I propose that Ian Niles be accepted as the co-ordinator and
developer of the SUO content, on the basis that no-one else is proposing or
offering to undertake the work. 

	.	I further propose that the SUO content co-ordinator and
developer be required to advise the group of every change that s/he makes on
their own initiative, so that the merits of each such change can be
considered by the other group members. 

	.	RE: #4 'Practical Purpose': I have addressed the issue of
potential alternative start points several times recently. Only one
alternative has so far even been registered, but, so far, no-one is prepared
to champion even that. We're quite prepared to consider any suggestions on
their merits.  

	.	Since you evidently feel "that what we currently have is too
far from something that would be an acceptable standard, that it does not
constitute a start point", what do you suggest as the alternative????
Numbers of us are eagerly waiting to actually hear a positive option rather
than just another criticism. Matthew, the ball is in your court!!

Proposed Solution: 
	.	(None was provided by Matthew) I propose that the current
development work by Ian Niles be continued until someone actually proposes a
viable alternative. 

	.	RE: #5 'Email Process': I agree about the resourcing problem
with the more usual standards development approach you mention. Another
issue is that it is necessarily far slower than other approaches are capable
of being - that's one of the reasons the Internet is being taken up as a
mean of facilitating and expediting work. 

	.	In regard to your final comment that: "We could make the
e-mail stuff work better than it does", I wish to suggest an oft used and
well proven approach, including in standards development. This is that each
comment include a "proposed solution". This works best when the proposed
solution provides actual suggested alternative content that can be readily
assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem. 

	.	I suggest that, if this approach is undertaken, then we will
make far better and faster progress.  

Proposed Solution: 
	.	I propose that all future comments on the SUO development
each include a "proposed solution". As far as possible, the proposed
solution is to provide actual suggested alternative content that can be
readily assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem.
Comments that do not do this will not be ignored, but their adoption cannot
be achieved until a satisfactory proposed solution has been identified and
accepted.

Dear Jim,

I think the issue here is that what we currently have is too far from
something that would be an acceptable standard, that it does not constitute
a start point.

&gt; Chris Partridge &lt;mail@ChrisPartridge.net&gt; submitted the comment:
&gt; 
&gt; 	"It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat 
&gt; and John say -
&gt; is not
&gt; sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as 
&gt; Matthew says - does
&gt; not seem to be ready for practical use. It seems to me that - 
&gt; as it stands -
&gt; the Ontology is not really a standard
&gt; that is fit for any practical purpose.

&gt; 
&gt; Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat and John 
&gt; say - is not
&gt; sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as 
&gt; Matthew says - does
&gt; not seem to be ready for practical use.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that - as it stands - the Ontology is not 
&gt; really a standard
&gt; that is fit for any practical purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of making concrete
&gt; suggestions via email is adequate for the task at hand. A point that a
&gt; number of people have made in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete 
&gt; suggestion for a way
&gt; to produce an adequate product. I think the task is of a size 
&gt; that anything
&gt; I would suggest would involve the old standards such as a project with
&gt; resources and a plan that gave some substance to the process 
&gt; of analysis to
&gt; be followed and the deliverables. But there is no point in 
&gt; starting this
&gt; unless there is some kind of commitment in terms of resources.
