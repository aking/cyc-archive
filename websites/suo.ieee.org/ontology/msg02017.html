Dear Graham,

&gt; Dear Matthew, 
&gt; 	.		Thanks for this.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Sorry for being ignorant, but it goes over my head in
&gt; places, so I have made some further comments and questions 
&gt; interspersed
&gt; below, prefaced  "GH&gt;	".

MW: Don't apologise, answering questions is what it is all about.

&gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; 
&gt; I have put various bits of where I currently stand in various 
&gt; threads over
&gt; the last year. I have found on a number of occasions that 
&gt; this position has
&gt; been misunderstood by at least some. So I thought I would try 
&gt; to set down
&gt; some of these matters in one place, so that you can disagree 
&gt; with what I
&gt; really think, rather than what you imagine I think.
&gt; 
&gt; MOTIVATION
&gt; 
&gt; In the end, any view of the world is just that, a view of the 
&gt; world. Some
&gt; may be more accurate, or more useful for some purpose. But 
&gt; then you had
&gt; better understand the purpose you have in mind.
&gt; 
&gt; For more than 10 years I have been looking at how you can 
&gt; create a model
&gt; that can integrate other models of differing viewpoints and 
&gt; purposes. This
&gt; is slightly different from incorporating different view points in an
&gt; encyclopaedic sense, it means more being able to map any 
&gt; other view point
&gt; into or out of the integrating view point you are developing. 
&gt; 
&gt; OK so that may be asking a lot, but one of the things I have 
&gt; learnt is that
&gt; the easiest way not to achieve something is to be limited by 
&gt; your ambition,
&gt; so failure against that ambition by some margin would still 
&gt; be pretty good.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course implicit in this is that I am quite happy that 
&gt; there are other
&gt; viewpoints, each of which may be more or less useful for particular
&gt; purposes. I am interested in understanding these so that I 
&gt; can check whether
&gt; the viewpoint I am trying to develop can support a round trip 
&gt; mapping to and
&gt; from that viewpoint. 
&gt; 
&gt; You can of course incorporate all the viewpoints and the 
&gt; mappings into an
&gt; encyclopaedic ontology. Whether you choose to do this is a structuring
&gt; rather than conceptual issue. 
&gt; 
&gt; What follows is an overview of key elements of that viewpoint 
&gt; (for which I
&gt; claim no originality) and some issues of how that can be 
&gt; represented within
&gt; the KIF language.
&gt; 
&gt; EXTENSIONALIST
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to put a label on me, then I think extensionalist 
&gt; is probably
&gt; your best bet. What I mean by this is taking as an identity 
&gt; criteria for
&gt; things, that any two things with the same extension are the 
&gt; same thing. (It
&gt; might be more proper to say that there are not two (or more) 
&gt; things with the
&gt; same extension).
&gt; 
&gt; The world then divides neatly into two basic sorts, sets (including
&gt; relations) and individuals (or particulars if you prefer) 
&gt; where individuals
&gt; are things that have an extension in space time, and sets are 
&gt; things that
&gt; have members. 
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	Am not sure that this is a precise statement. Do you 
&gt; possibly mean
&gt; that sets are really the generic aspects of a group of 
&gt; things, and that that
&gt; is what can be analysed in considering a set, rather than any specific
&gt; attributes of individual members of the set? (This question 
&gt; based on some of
&gt; the early parts of John Sowa's Mathematical Background, and makes an
&gt; enormous difference to how I can interpret what follows. 

MW: What I mean is that two sets are the same if they have the same
membership. Individuals do not have members. There are some sets we 
attach significance to and give names, like "car" or "gives" with 
some greater or lesser degree of precision.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing to note about this position is that any piece of 
&gt; space time is an
&gt; individual, just as any collection of things is a set. That 
&gt; is different
&gt; again from having to be interested in all of them.
&gt; 
&gt; The extension of individuals being in space time give rise to 
&gt; the 4D label.
&gt; 
&gt; It follows that some important ways in which things stand to 
&gt; one another are
&gt; set membership and whole part.
&gt; 
&gt; A key thing to note is that this extensional approach 
&gt; automatically takes
&gt; care of change over time, using states as the backbone of how this is
&gt; managed. Competent and comprehensive accounting for change is 
&gt; a critical
&gt; component of any ontology that is going to cope with a changing world.
&gt; 
&gt; POSSIBLE WORLDS
&gt; 
&gt; One of the key challenges for any viewpoint is how to model 
&gt; what could be
&gt; (past present and future), as well as what is/has been. This 
&gt; is done using a
&gt; "possible worlds" approach, or more properly possible 
&gt; universes, in which
&gt; spatio-temporal parts can be shared between different 
&gt; possible universes. So
&gt; my life up to today can be part of any possible future I might have. 
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	For analytical purposes, I would also suggest there is 
&gt; usefulness in
&gt; "could have been" situations, where it is postulated a 
&gt; difference occurred
&gt; at one or more past points in space-time. 

MW: These are also covered by possible worlds, it is just that
the temporal location is in the past rather than the future.
Remember, a 4D approach is neutral to past/present/future. "Now"
is a moving line on a constant background.
&gt; 
&gt; A consequence of this (I believe) is that modal logic is not required.
&gt; 
&gt; REPRESENTATION
&gt; 
&gt; KIF is a language, so is EXPRESS. Languages inevitably have 
&gt; capabilities and
&gt; limitations. 
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	My gut feel is that you are here distinguishing between 
&gt; ideal and
&gt; real languages. 

MW: I have no idea. I'm certainly not refering to natural languages.
&gt; 
&gt; A viewpoint can be mapped onto the constructs of a language, 
&gt; in more than
&gt; one way. It then becomes important to consider how you intend 
&gt; to undertake
&gt; the mapping. There are advantages in doing so in a consistent 
&gt; manner, and in
&gt; being aware of what it is you are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction if I 
&gt; am not) the key
&gt; constructs in KIF are:
&gt;  - constants
&gt;  - variables (and more generally lambda calculus)
&gt;  - predication
&gt;  - relation
&gt;  - some basic elements of logic
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	It sure would help to have succinct plain-English descriptions /
&gt; definitions of each of these terms. 

MW: Hm. I'm probably not the best person to do this, but here goes.

Constant

A label that always refers to the same thing whenever it occurs.
e.g. In this e-mail the constant "Matthew West" always refers to me.

Variable

A label that may range over different things.
e.g. in "y=x+2" y and x are variables that range over numbers.

Predication

Well I take it to be the assertion that something is true of something.
But to be honest I am hazy about this.

Relation

A predication of a set of tuples. e.g. connection is a relation
and &lt;pipe1, valve1&gt; might be a member.

Basic elements of logic.

With logic, there are some different start points you can take, from
which the rest can be derived. I think that "not" and "and" is one
possible start point. However, whatever your startpoint, you want to
define a number of other basic elements like "or" "inference" "Forall"
"exists".
&gt; 
&gt; The question is how do you choose to use these. The only thing that is
&gt; certain is that if you are not consistent you will store up 
&gt; trouble for
&gt; yourself. 
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	Agreed absolutely. 
&gt; 
&gt; The choices I make are:
&gt; 
&gt; o  classes and individuals map to constants
&gt;     note: remember that activities like giving are individuals
&gt; o  predication is used for set membership.
&gt;     note: in an extensional world you do not 
&gt;     need non-extensional classes
&gt; o  how one individual stands to another is modelled by 
&gt;     relation instances
&gt;     note: only binary relations are used. This is principally
&gt;     to minimise structural constraints where all places in a 
&gt;     relation must be filled, when some are not known.
&gt;     note: see below for relations between classes.
&gt; o  lambda calculus is used for defining constraints. 
&gt;     In general these indicate how a member of one class 
&gt;     must stand in respect to a member of another class.
&gt;     note: relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are
&gt;     only allowed when the nature of the constraint they
&gt;     define is defined by a lambda expression.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I do not claim other choices for other reasons 
&gt; could not be made.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, everything else flows from these relatively simple 
&gt; start points
&gt; and rationale. 
&gt; 
&gt; GH&gt;	sounds like a good basic structure. 

MW: Good.
