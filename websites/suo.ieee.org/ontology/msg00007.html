Factorization SIG,

Précis of the Plot So Far ...

Graphical Conventions:

By way of representing projective relationships in this
ASCII-affine space, where only certain angles of lines
are allowed, to wit, elements of {"-", "/", "|", "\"},
I am using "parallel lines of identity" (PLOI's) to
collapse, equate, equivalence, identify, quotient --
or select your own favorite term of identification --
ostensibly multiple nodes into one, depicted like this:

      @
      =
      @
     ...     or     @=@=...=@=@
      =
      @
      =
      @

Typographical Conventions:

I will use "sharp brackets" around terms, as #A#, for bold face type.
I will use "scrip brackets" around terms, as $A$, for curl face type.

Illustration of One Brand of Factorization:

Example of a Certain Type of Transformation on Sign Relations,
To Wit, a Mapping of Type $R$ -&gt; $R$, Where $R$ is a Suitable
Category or Collection of Sign Relations, To Be Nomenclated
As a Phantom Limb Extension (PLE) of Sign Relations in $R$.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Jon,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is interesting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | Relative to the present genre, the distinction
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | of reality, that can be granted to certain objects
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | of thought and not to others, fulfills an analogous
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | role to the distinction that singles out "sets" among
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | "classes" in modern versions of set theory.  Taking the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | membership relation [epsilon] as a predecessor relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | in a pre-designated hierarchy of classes, a class attains
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | the status of a set, and by dint of this becomes an object
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | of determinate discussion, simply if it has successors.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | Pragmatic reality is distinguished from both the medieval
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | and the modern versions, however, by the fact that its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | reality is always a reality to someone.  This is due
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | to the circumstance that it takes both an abstract
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | property and a concrete interpreter to establish
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; | the practical reality of an object.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Practical Reality is an interesting concept.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I get there by a slightly different route.
&gt; &gt; &gt; (English understatement?  You decide.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sparely speaking, Scottish, but Anglish for a' that.
&gt; &gt; It has frequently been observed that pragmatic thought
&gt; &gt; has "hi" and "lo" causeys, but that it is nevertheless
&gt; &gt; maximatic to the "way of things" (WOT), that the hi &amp; lo
&gt; &gt; roads, however much they may diverge in our parti-colored
&gt; &gt; woods, may, might just -- nay, must -- eventually converge
&gt; &gt; at or nigh unto the end of inquiry.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; | Robert Cummings Neville, 'The High Road Around Modernism',
&gt; &gt; | State University of New York Press, Albany, NY, 1992.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: For me all the possible sets are just out there,
&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting for someone to take an interest in them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They exist (whatever that means) simply because
&gt; &gt; &gt; their members exist (or not in the case of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; null set).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This makes you what is commonly called
&gt; &gt; a "platonically unabashed realist" (PURist), or
&gt; &gt; sometimes a "naively unsophisticated platonist" (NUPist).  
&gt; &gt; Welcome to the club.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For me, however, I am less sanguine about
&gt; &gt; the unquestioned existence of individuals,
&gt; &gt; if that is what you intend to constitute
&gt; &gt; the prior foundation of class membership.
&gt; 
&gt; MW:  I was not making any commitments about what other sorts of things
&gt; might exist.  However, since you bring it up, in my view you can point
&gt; at any piece of space time (not necessarily contiguous) and express an
&gt; interest in it.  So rather like sets, there are an aweful lot of them
&gt; out there.

When you speak of an "aweful lot", I have to
assume that you are alluding to Lot 49 again.
Which brings up the point:  Are there not
pieces of spacetime that force themselves
on your attention, whether you initially
elect to take an interest in them or not?

&gt; Strangely we seem to be interested in the bits that have order and pattern
&gt; to them that are themselves the bits that are members of the aforementioned
&gt; interesting sets.

Strange that you should use this word "strangely",
since I suspect that by means of that deceptively
innocent remark you mean to force my attention to
recognize, rather opposed to what I would rather
go on thinking, a rather remarkable diversity of
counterveiling circumstances that insuffuse your
studied remarks, to wit, that rather often it is
the very pieces of spacetime eventuality where
"orders or patterns" (OOP's) are most lacking
that force us to attend to their consequences
and effects, if only in the frequently futile
hope and prayer, by one swell foop, to bring
a "form of order or pattern" (FOOOP) to the
compulsory chaos that whelms our ontosophy.

Ontosophy?
You know, that recapitulates to phylosophy.

&gt; However, just as I do not deny existence to sets,
&gt; nor do I deny existence to those bits of space time
&gt; that are uninteresting, I merely ignore them.

Yeah, me too, for as long as they let me be.

&gt; MW:  By individual, do you mean whole individual
&gt; (e.g. me for my whole life) or do you allow any
&gt; interesting bit of space time (e.g. me for today)?

See the thread where Peirce examines the "doctrine of individuals".
As a rough guideline, I would most likely start with what he says.
As with so many terms like this that we have all been given the
habit of treating as if they referred to an absolute attribute,
a basic being, a constant category, a dedicated determination,
an essential element, or a fixed feature of an object in the
world, I will tend to ask the question whether the condition
of being an individaul is not more like a role into which an
actor is cast than a cast that it bears as an indelible type,
in sum, whether it is more likely to be an "interpretive" or
a "variable" category than an "essential" or an "invariant"
category, and the answer that I almost always come up with,
except in the rarest of cases, at least, once I stop in my
headlong rush of thought long enough to fairly examine the
question, is "yes".

&gt; &gt; More on this later, when I finally get around to reading 
&gt; &gt; Peirce's remarks on the "Doctrine Of Individuals" (DOI)
&gt; &gt; into the record of these proceedings.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW:  For me the key point is what makes just a very few
&gt; &gt; &gt; of these of interest (relative to the total available).
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is fairly straight forward, it is that all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; members of some sets exhibit a pattern that has
&gt; &gt; &gt; (or to which we attribute) significance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The rest we just discard as uninteresting
&gt; &gt; &gt; (not really practical).

You have just given an apt description of the situation
at the end of a given inquiry.  But it begins elsewhere,
elsewise.  Here is John Dewey's "definition of inquiry",
that Sue and I quote in our "Interpretation as Action":

| Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation
| of an indeterminate situation into one that is so
| determinate in its constituent distinctions and
| relations as to convert the elements of the
| original situation into a unified whole.
|
| John Dewey, "Logic:  The Theory of Inquiry",
| In 'John Dewey:  The Later Works, 1925-1953, Volume 12: 1938',
| Edited by Jo Ann Boydston, Southern Illinois University Press,
| Carbondale, IL, 1986, page 108.

&gt; &gt; Now try to imagine designing a piece of software that would help folks
&gt; &gt; search through the space of 'all' sets -- all accessible, accountable,
&gt; &gt; available, enumerable, generable, miserable, whatever -- looking for
&gt; &gt; some constructions that might be useful in general or in particular.
&gt; &gt; If you pursue this act of imagination to the point of rolling up the
&gt; &gt; sleeves of your T-shirt and setting about the writing of an effective
&gt; &gt; program (programme?), then you will probably be able to reconstruct the
&gt; &gt; better and the worser parts of my prolegomena-legistic attitude towards
&gt; &gt; all future forms of 'a priori' ontology.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: So, your classes that have practical reality, align with
&gt; &gt; &gt; my constructivist sets that exhibit interesting patterns -
&gt; &gt; &gt; or so it seems to me.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; May Be,
&gt; &gt; Will See,
