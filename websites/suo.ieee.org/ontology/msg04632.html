NOW.  Note 1

| 4.  Wittgenstein's Picture Theory
|
| But there is also a major difference between Russell
| and Wittgenstein.  Russell's theory of acquaintance was
| supposed to explain, not only the structure of our knowledge,
| but also the structure of propositions, including the conditions
| on their meaningfulness.  What is for instance required if I am to
| understand a simple (elementary) relational proposition of the form
| R(a, b), for instance, &quot;Ludwig hits Karl&quot;, assuming that it is fully
| analyzed?  In order to understand this proposition, I have to be
| acquainted with its simplest ingredients, in this case Ludwig, Karl,
| and the relation of hitting.  But this is not enough.  In order to
| understand R(a, b), I must for instance distinguish it from the
| converse proposition R(b, a), in the example &quot;Karl hits Ludwig&quot;.
| Since the two involve the same three objects of acquaintance,
| something else is needed.  This something else is according to
| Russell the logical form of the proposition in question.  [As?]
| All basic ingredients of a proposition, it must also be an object
| of acquaintance.  Likewise, there must be logical forms characteristic
| of various structures of propositions, such as disjunction and conjunction.
| These objects are called &quot;logical objects&quot; and their representation in language
| &quot;logical constants&quot;.  Thus, Russell postulated a separate class of objects of
| acquaintance called &quot;logical forms&quot;.
|
| Russell explained this culmination of his theory of acquaintance in the book
| 'Theory of Knowledge' which he wrote in 1913.  He made the mistake of showing
| it to Wittgenstein who was highly critical, not to say contemptuous, telling
| Russell that he had himself entertained similar ideas but found them entirely
| wrong.  Russell was so discouraged that he never published the entire 'Theory
| of Knowledge'.  It appeared posthumously in 1984 as volume 7 of Russell's
| 'Collected Papers'.
|
| This pinpoints Wittgenstein's 'Tractatus' precisely in relation to Russell.
| The 'Tractatus' is nothing more and nothing less than Russell's 1913 theory
| 'sans' logical forms as objects of acquaintance.  This relationship was for
| a long time obscured by philosophers' unawareness of Russell's for a long
| time unpublished book.  Wittgenstein himself was nevertheless fully aware
| of the relation:
|
| | My fundamental thoughts is that &quot;logical constants&quot;
| | do not represent [anything].  ('Tractatus' 4.0312).
|
| | Here it becomes clear that there are no such things
| | as &quot;logical objects&quot; or &quot;logical constants&quot; (in the
| | sense of Frege and Russell).  ('Tractatus', 5.4).
