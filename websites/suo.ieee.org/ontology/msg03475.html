&gt; ¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤
&gt; 
&gt; JA = Jon Awbrey
&gt; MW = Matthew West
&gt; 
&gt; JA: In my opinion, the question should be the pertinence,
&gt;     the quality, and the rationality of my contributions.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I agree.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I welcome any concrete advice, criticisms, and objections that
&gt;     you or anyone might have about these aspects of my efforts here.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This is asking for it, and I will make some suggestions 
&gt; below.  But
&gt;     at least I speak as one who believes you have a 
&gt; contributionto make.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, I appreciate that.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I have acted on such advice over the past year.  I have 
&gt; changed the style
&gt;     of my discussion, to the best of my present abilities, to 
&gt; accommodate the
&gt;     purposes and even the reading tastes of the Working Group.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I agree you have made changes (improvements) to the style 
&gt; of your contributions.
&gt;     I have noticed in particular that your contributions are 
&gt; much less elliptical.
&gt;     I am grateful, it has meant I have been able to follow a 
&gt; greater percentage
&gt;     of what you have to say.  For the record I probably 
&gt; manage to read half of
&gt;     what you write, and get the gist of two thirds of that.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: OK.  Well here comes the tough bit.  How do I think you could
&gt;     improve the effectiveness of your contribution?  Note this is
&gt;     a personal view.  It is what I would like to see.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: The real problem is not what you are trying to say, but the
&gt;     way you are saying it.  You are using what I would describe
&gt;     as an academic approach rather than a business approach.
&gt;     An academic approach builds up the foundations on which
&gt;     an argument is built before setting out the key conclusions
&gt;     of an argument.  A business approach presents the conclusions,
&gt;     and promises the foundations in an appendix that is yet to be
&gt;     written, and will not be unless the conclusions are challenged.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I have spent my whole life in &quot;academe&quot;, or on the fringes of it,
&gt; sometimes in theoretical pursuits, but most of the time, in parallel,
&gt; working at more practical applications in real data, applied math,
&gt; and med/psy/soc science statistical work.  I have &quot;osmoted&quot; a bit
&gt; of familiarity with education and organization studies from the
&gt; resident expert in my family, but no, as you recognize, not so
&gt; much business experience.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: The consequence of the approach you take is that the volume
&gt;     of your contributions is significant, with it taking a long
&gt;     time to reach the point you are trying to make, by which
&gt;     time most people have lost interest.  Indeed I suspect
&gt;     many feel there probably isn't any conclusion at all.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: If you started with some bold assertions/conclusions about
&gt;     what we needed to do to achieve something useful (1 page max)
&gt;     then you might expect to be challenged, but that would give you
&gt;     the opportunity to elaborate on the issues someone else raised.
&gt; 
&gt; It is my experience here that people tend to become downright
&gt; abusive toward people who make bold assertions, especially if
&gt; you cannot prove them to their satisfaction in a few 1-liners.
&gt; Not that I let that stop me.  Still ...

MW: I think you have to see these challenges more positively (and
not retreat into defensively verbose responses as you tend to).
&gt; 
&gt; MW: One story burned in my memory from long ago is the one about the
&gt;     manager who asked his subordinate to produce a 1 page summary of
&gt;     some burning issue.  The subordinate worked all night to distill
&gt;     his 10 page thesis down to 1 page, but he could only get it down
&gt;     to one and a half pages.  He took it to his boss and apologised,
&gt;     but said he really couldn't get it down to just a page.  His boss
&gt;     took the 2 pages from him and told him not to worry, because he
&gt;     knew just how to do that, as he threw the second page in the
&gt;     waste bin.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: The point is, that if your customer will only read one page,
&gt;     it doesn't matter how much more you write.
&gt; 
&gt; Even with my limited business sense, I got used to the idea a 
&gt; long time ago
&gt; that some people just want it simple, and will not buy it 
&gt; unless it is so.
&gt; It is still a bit of a puzzle to me, though, what would drive 
&gt; a customer
&gt; like that to be in the ontology market in the first place, I mean,
&gt; selling instead of buying.

MW: We are all selling our ideas here. You have to show people that they
are worth the price.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: OK, that is one suggestion, start by bringing the conclusions to
&gt;     the list, not the working.  On the other hand I would appreciate
&gt;     the working of some of your threads as PDF documents as backup
&gt;     to the conclusions.  PDF would have the advantage of solving the
&gt;     presentation issues you have too, since you would not be limited
&gt;     to ASCII, and I would then have a coherent record I could refer
&gt;     to more easily.
&gt; 
&gt; For your sake, I would look into this -- would Word be ok? --

MW: For me yes - PDF is better for general use, not everyone has or
likes MS products.

&gt; but frankly, I do not get the sense that many people here
&gt; are reading any of the resource documents, not just mine.

MW: Do you think many people are reading your e-mails?

MW: Personally I am always pleased with a small number of readers,
if they are the right ones.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I know you think no one will read something in a PDF document,
&gt;     but I got some responses to my recent contribution on 
&gt; modularisation
&gt;     that I did in this way, and if you have presented your 
&gt; conclusions in
&gt;     a tempting way, then I think you would get more interest 
&gt; in what you
&gt;     have to say.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Well enough I guess, except perhaps to offer a little time to work
&gt;     with you off list on some trials at my proposed approach 
&gt; should you
&gt;     choose to accept the challenge.
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, never let a good dare go by, I always say.
