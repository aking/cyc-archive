&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; ENTELECHY, (Gr. entelechia, word invented by Aristitole,
&gt; from en telei echon, having attained the end).
&gt; 
&gt; Literally, attainment, realization;  opposed to power, potentiality, and nearly the
&gt; same as energy or act (actuality).  The idea of entelechy is connected with that of
&gt; form, the idea of power with that of matter.  Iron is potentially in its ore, which
&gt; to be made iron must be worked.  When this is done, the iron exists in entelechy.
&gt; The passage from power to entelechy takes place by means of change (kinesis).
&gt; This is the imperfect energy, the perfected energy is the entelechy.  First
&gt; entelechy is being in working order, second entelechy is being in action.
&gt; The soul is said to be a first entelechy, that is a thing precisely like
&gt; a man in every respect, execept that it would not feel, would be a body
&gt; without a soul;  but a soul once infused is not lost whenever the man
&gt; is asleep.  This is the Aristotlian sense, but Cudworth and others
&gt; have used entelechy  and first entelechy somewhat differently.
&gt; Cudworth calls his plastle nature or vital principle the
&gt; first entelechy, and Leibnitz terms a monad an entelechy.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Signs as first entelechy would be best described by the formal definition
&gt; of L75 (like a soul without a body, if the metaphor helps you see what I
&gt; meant in claiming that there was something missing in it).  Signs as second
&gt; entelechy would correspond to semiosis itself, i.e. signs in action, change;
&gt; and when the ultimate interpretant is reached whenever that may happen that
&gt; would be called entelechy (not "third" entelechy, but simply entelechy)?

Jean-Marc,

Still just free associating ...

I have the impression that I learned this word from Goethe --
the image of the Homunculus in 'Faust' comes to mind, and
the sense in which I have always understood its etymology
is that of an "end in itself", in other words, the mark
which distinguishes an art of conduction or recreation
from all the arts of acquisition and production, but
these memories are far too dim and old to trace, so
I will leave them be as personal poetic kennings.

Jon Awbrey

P.S.

The relation between entelechy and dynamics is one of those tantalizing
questions that motivates my current approach to Inquiry Driven Systems.
I cited some associated texts along these lines, some of them being my
earliest influences in this direction, way back at the very beginning
of my stint in the Peirce Forum:

| Matter is potentiality (dynamis), while form is
| realization or actuality (entelecheia), and the
| word actuality is used in two senses, illustrated
| by the possession of knowledge (episteme) and the
| exercise of it (theorein).
|
| So the soul (psyche) must be substance (ousia)
| in the sense of being the form (eidos) of a
| natural body (soma), which potentially (dynamei)
| has life (zoe).  And substance in this sense is
| actuality (entelecheia).
|
| Aristotle, "Peri Psyche", 2.1

| The passage from power to entelechy takes place
| by means of change (kinesis).  This is the
| imperfect energy, the perfected energy
| is the entelechy.
|
| CSP, CE 5, 404

| I shall, therefore, venture to call Sum (m.v^2)/2
| the kinetic act or kinetic energy and the negative
| of the potential, the kinetic power or kinetic
| potency.  For the sum of the two I can think of
| no better term than 'motivity' or 'kinesis'.
|

| Tho' obscur'd, this is the form of the Angelic land.
|
| William Blake, "America",
| Re-Cited as an Epigraph in Protocol to the American Edition of:
| George Spencer Brown, 'Laws of Form', 1972.

| In arriving at proofs, I have often been struck
| by the apparent alignment of mathematics with
| psycho-analytic theory.  In each discipline
| we attempt to find out, by a mixture of
| contemplation, symbolic representation,
| communion, and communication, what
| it is we already know.
|
| GSB, LOF, xix

| One of the motives prompting the furtherance of
| the present work was the hope of bringing together
| the investigations of the inner structure of our
| knowledge of the universe, as expressed in the
| mathematical sciences, and the investigations of
| its outer structure, as expressed in the physical
| sciences.  Here the work of Einstein, Schrodinger,
| and others seems to have led to the realization of
| an ultimate boundary of physical knowledge in the
| form of the media through which we perceive it.
|
| GSB, LOF, xxi

| What is encompassed, in mathematics, is a
| transcedence from a given state of vision to a
| new, and hitherto unapparent, vision beyond it.
| When the present existence has ceased to make
| sense, it can still come to sense again through
| the realization of its form.
|
| GSB, LOF, xxiii
|
| [ yes, it's "transcedence", not "transcendence"!!! ]
| [ sic transit gloria mundi, the diff an "n" makes! ]

| One of the most beautiful facts emerging from
| mathematical studies is this very potent relation-
| ship between the mathematical process and ordinary
| language.  There seems to be no mathematical idea
| of any importance or profundity that is not
| mirrored, with an almost uncanny accuracy, in the
| common use of words, and this appears especially
| true when we consider words in their original,
| and sometimes long forgotten, senses.
|
| GSB, LOF, 90-91

| Thus we do not imagine the wave train emitted by
| an excited finite echelon to be exactly like the
| wave train emitted from an excited physical
| particle.  For one thing the wave form from an
| echelon is square, and for another it is emitted
| without energy.  (We should need, I guess, to make
| at least one more departure from the form before
| arriving at a conception of energy on these lines.)
|
| GSB, LOF, 100

| Ladies and gentlemen, I have set this aspect
| of exact science before you because in it the
| affinity with the fine arts becomes most plainly
| visible, and because here one may counter the
| misapprehension that natural science and
| technology are concerned solely with precise
| observation and rational, discursive thought.
| To be sure, this rational thinking and careful
| measurement belong to the scientist's work, just
| as the hammer and chisel belong to the work of the
| sculptor.  But in both cases they are merely the
| tools and not the content of the work.

&gt; Dear Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; I enjoyed your response.  Certainly a film is a process through which one
&gt; gains information -- from point zero (vagueness and pure possibility) with
&gt; the opening credits to a maximum of information after (and beyond) the film
&gt; (through interpretation).
&gt; 
&gt; I must admit though that my query was mostly biographical (and I would still
&gt; like to know if anyone has information on this) -- but I was also curious to
&gt; see whether motion pictures were used conceptually (metaphorically) by Peirce
&gt; in explaining some of his ideas.  I am not a logician and the Graphs represent
&gt; for me -- not so much in their broad principles as in their detail -- the most
&gt; difficult/complex aspect of Peirce's work.  In any case, when Peirce discusses
&gt; the Gamma graph (CP 4.512) as "a book of separate sheets" -- keeping in mind that
&gt; each sheet is a film, a photograph of sorts (an icon) -- it got me thinking of those
&gt; flip-books that are part of cinema's ancestry (as are all those 19th century gizmos and
&gt; inventions whose goal was to bring movement to images -- zoetrope, phenakistoscope, etc. ...,
&gt; all the way to the cinematographe).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Martin Lefebvre

To BugDaddy, Jim P, Jim W, Martin, and All:

What can I say, compared to that!?
I will no doubt say it anyway,
maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow --
but soon, and you know the rest ...

Jon

P.S.  At least we'll always have Peirce!
