Matthew,

The "triadic" issue in the example you have given is whether we can
analyze this example into triads which add up to the whole picture without
any loss of logical content.  In listing the attributes of the measurement
problem you have already done this, if we can show that each element of
the problem-- time of observation, measurement device, measurement scale,
place of observation, observing subject, observed object etc.-- is
reducible to the pattern O(for object)-R(for representamen)-I (for
interpretant), where any R can also be seen as an O for some further
O-R-I, and any I can be seen as an O or R for some further O-R-I, and any
O may also be an R or an I, and so on, this whole business being the
continuum of semiosis, infinitely extendable and infinitesimally
refinable.

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Colleagues,
&gt; 
&gt; This has been a very interesting discussion, in which I have learnt some
&gt; things, and been surprised at some things that I thought were common ground
&gt; but were not.
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly the good news. I think I now understand what John means when he says
&gt; "mediating". He means an activity, or the result of an activity, in which
&gt; more than two things are necessarily involved form an ontological viewpoint.
&gt; 
&gt; Pat has explained some theoretical background to graph theory from which I
&gt; draw (actually I already knew this) that there is more than one way that the
&gt; world can be represented as a graph (or some other formalism) and that the
&gt; triadic iirreducibility only applies when you take one particular
&gt; representation.
&gt; 
&gt; I have one unanswered question. Part of the claim about irreducible
&gt; triadicity is that anything that is higher than triadic can be reduced to
&gt; triadic. Pat and Nicola (I think) have suggested that there is no reason why
&gt; the limit should be 3 for ontological dependence. So I have presented a test
&gt; example about measurement. Measurement is just about the most complicated
&gt; thing I have come across in my years of analysis, and I am prepared to
&gt; believe that if the information about a measurement can be reduced to triads
&gt; that are independent, then it is likely that anything else can. On the other
&gt; hand John has not responded to this example, which I repeat below.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: OK. In that case please show me how a measurement can be
&gt; &gt; reduced to triads. A Measurement is an activity that:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; has a subject (the thing measured)
&gt; &gt; an observer (doing the measuring)
&gt; &gt; an instrument (e.g. thermometer)
&gt; &gt; a measure (what about the thing is being measured, e.g. temperature)
&gt; &gt; a result (the value e.g. 20)
&gt; &gt; a Unit of Measure (e.g. Celsius)
&gt; &gt; the time when the measurement was taken.
&gt; 
&gt; I would be interested to see whether and how this can be reduced to triadic
&gt; or less ontologically dependent elements. If it can't, then there is at
&gt; least one case where this does not apply (which is enough) or perhaps as Pat
&gt; has been suggesting there has been confusion between graph theory and
&gt; ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; Well I guess the next question is "does it really matter?". By this I mean,
&gt; does it really matter that there are different mappings from the world onto
&gt; graph theoretic representations.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately the answer is "yes", as we discovered in Shell some 10-15
&gt; years ago. At about that time many of the 200 or so companies in the Shell
&gt; Group were getting into relational databases, mostly developing much the
&gt; same systems to do much the same thing in different countries. Something
&gt; that we noticed to our horror was that all these systems were generally
&gt; incompatible, and that generally they were not transferrable either. We
&gt; (then the corporate data management group) were asked to look at why this
&gt; was the case.
&gt; 
&gt; The databases were generally documented in data models. (Data Models can be
&gt; seen as graphs with entity types as nodes, relationship types as edges, and
&gt; attribute types as leaf nodes.) When we examined the data models we found
&gt; that one of the (many) problems was that people had mapped the real world
&gt; onto these constructs in a variety of ways. Let us take activities as an
&gt; example:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) as a relationship type, with the participants at either end of the
&gt; relationship.
&gt; 2) as a "transaction" - an entity type with a number of dependent
&gt; relationships.
&gt; 3) as an independent entity type with non-dependent relationships to the
&gt; objects involved.
&gt; 4) a mixture of 2 &amp; 3.
&gt; 
&gt; 1)

&gt;  o------------o               o----------o          o----------o
&gt; 
&gt; Of course these different structures are not directly compatible
&gt; and in many cases arbitrary combinations of these different approaches
&gt; were taken.
&gt; 
&gt; So one of the things we did was to study the differences between these
&gt; (and other) representations. The conclusions to these have been
&gt; implemented in the EPISTLE Core Model. Incidently, the ECM V4.0
&gt; has just been published, and can be found at:
