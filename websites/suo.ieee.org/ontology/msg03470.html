JA = Jon Awbrey
MW = Matthew West

JA: In my opinion, the question should be the pertinence,
    the quality, and the rationality of my contributions.

MW: I agree.

JA: I welcome any concrete advice, criticisms, and objections that
    you or anyone might have about these aspects of my efforts here.

MW: This is asking for it, and I will make some suggestions below.  But
    at least I speak as one who believes you have a contributionto make.

Thanks, I appreciate that.

JA: I have acted on such advice over the past year.  I have changed the style
    of my discussion, to the best of my present abilities, to accommodate the
    purposes and even the reading tastes of the Working Group.

MW: I agree you have made changes (improvements) to the style of your contributions.
    I have noticed in particular that your contributions are much less elliptical.
    I am grateful, it has meant I have been able to follow a greater percentage
    of what you have to say.  For the record I probably manage to read half of
    what you write, and get the gist of two thirds of that.

MW: OK.  Well here comes the tough bit.  How do I think you could
    improve the effectiveness of your contribution?  Note this is
    a personal view.  It is what I would like to see.

MW: The real problem is not what you are trying to say, but the
    way you are saying it.  You are using what I would describe
    as an academic approach rather than a business approach.
    An academic approach builds up the foundations on which
    an argument is built before setting out the key conclusions
    of an argument.  A business approach presents the conclusions,
    and promises the foundations in an appendix that is yet to be
    written, and will not be unless the conclusions are challenged.

Yes, I have spent my whole life in &quot;academe&quot;, or on the fringes of it,
sometimes in theoretical pursuits, but most of the time, in parallel,
working at more practical applications in real data, applied math,
and med/psy/soc science statistical work.  I have &quot;osmoted&quot; a bit
of familiarity with education and organization studies from the
resident expert in my family, but no, as you recognize, not so
much business experience.

MW: The consequence of the approach you take is that the volume
    of your contributions is significant, with it taking a long
    time to reach the point you are trying to make, by which
    time most people have lost interest.  Indeed I suspect
    many feel there probably isn't any conclusion at all.

MW: If you started with some bold assertions/conclusions about
    what we needed to do to achieve something useful (1 page max)
    then you might expect to be challenged, but that would give you
    the opportunity to elaborate on the issues someone else raised.

It is my experience here that people tend to become downright
abusive toward people who make bold assertions, especially if
you cannot prove them to their satisfaction in a few 1-liners.
Not that I let that stop me.  Still ...

MW: One story burned in my memory from long ago is the one about the
    manager who asked his subordinate to produce a 1 page summary of
    some burning issue.  The subordinate worked all night to distill
    his 10 page thesis down to 1 page, but he could only get it down
    to one and a half pages.  He took it to his boss and apologised,
    but said he really couldn't get it down to just a page.  His boss
    took the 2 pages from him and told him not to worry, because he
    knew just how to do that, as he threw the second page in the
    waste bin.

MW: The point is, that if your customer will only read one page,
    it doesn't matter how much more you write.

Even with my limited business sense, I got used to the idea a long time ago
that some people just want it simple, and will not buy it unless it is so.
It is still a bit of a puzzle to me, though, what would drive a customer
like that to be in the ontology market in the first place, I mean,
selling instead of buying.

MW: OK, that is one suggestion, start by bringing the conclusions to
    the list, not the working.  On the other hand I would appreciate
    the working of some of your threads as PDF documents as backup
    to the conclusions.  PDF would have the advantage of solving the
    presentation issues you have too, since you would not be limited
    to ASCII, and I would then have a coherent record I could refer
    to more easily.

For your sake, I would look into this -- would Word be ok? --
but frankly, I do not get the sense that many people here
are reading any of the resource documents, not just mine.

MW: I know you think no one will read something in a PDF document,
    but I got some responses to my recent contribution on modularisation
    that I did in this way, and if you have presented your conclusions in
    a tempting way, then I think you would get more interest in what you
    have to say.

MW: Well enough I guess, except perhaps to offer a little time to work
    with you off list on some trials at my proposed approach should you
    choose to accept the challenge.

Okay, never let a good dare go by, I always say.

Jon Awbrey
