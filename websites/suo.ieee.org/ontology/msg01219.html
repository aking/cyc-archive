&gt; Dear Matthew and Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; Every term on your outline is necessary for a complete system
&gt; of knowledge representation.  Indeed, all of these terms have
&gt; been used for many years in mathematics and physics, and they
&gt; have been formalized, axiomatized, and reasoned and computed
&gt; with in great depth in many different ways for a long time.
&gt; 
&gt; The big question is not whether they belong in the SUO.
&gt; The answer to that is simple:  yes, of course.
&gt; 
&gt; Even the issue of writing definitions and axioms for them
&gt; is not a big problem.  There are plenty of axiomatizations
&gt; for all of them that can be taken out of the literature of
&gt; math, logic, and physics, dusted off, and translated into
&gt; KIF, CGs, and many other notations.
&gt; 
&gt; One issue that has to be recognized:
&gt; all those axioms were designed for different purposes,
&gt; and they use very different primitives.  As an example,
&gt; I use the Eulerian and Langrangian systems of coordinates
&gt; for fluid mechanics.  Many of the same phenomena can be
&gt; represented in either one, but the representations have
&gt; very different structures and relationships.  That is
&gt; true of all those categories in the outline:  there are
&gt; many, many different coordinate systems and representations
&gt; that have been used, all of them are valuable for different
&gt; purposes, but the relationships between them are very far
&gt; from clear.  Taking one coordinate system instead of another
&gt; is a purely arbitrary choice, and you have to know how they
&gt; are related before you can make a rational decision about
&gt; how they should be positioned in the ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing that has to be determined is which of these issues
&gt; belong to the logic, which of them belong to the ontology, how the
&gt; logic relates to the ontology, and how the logic and the ontology
&gt; relate to the real world and/or any possible world, situation,
&gt; state of affairs, etc.  And the next thing is how can you reason
&gt; about them with the logic and talk about them with language(s)
&gt; you want to use.

Some folks I know say that our ontology, that is to say,
"what ought to be our ontology", is related to the level
of formal, logical, &amp; mathematical description in the way
that invariants are related to the transformations between
representations over which they are in fact the invariants.

This brings in a slightly novel perspective, in that,
even though we tend to think of our ontology as being
on the reality-side of our representational interface,
it is by operations on the inner-face of this carapace
that we come to acquire a re-constituted image of being.
This is connected, I imagine, to that algebraic principle
by which the "double dual" is closely akin to the original,
all of which happens, sure enough, only under ceratin cases.

Jon Awbrey

&gt; We all know that the knowledge representation must accommodate individuals,
&gt; states, events, space, time, space-time, process, activity, agents, etc.
&gt; But you cannot start to put these things into a hierarchy until you have
&gt; a very clear idea of what these things are, how you can refer to them in
&gt; logic, how they are classifiable by the ontology  (Note: classifiable is
&gt; a prerequisite to being classified), and how they relate to what is in
&gt; the world, what is perceived by humans, animals, or robots, how evidence
&gt; for them is obtained, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Only after these questions are answered, does it become
&gt; possible to say where you can position the categories in
&gt; the hierarchy, outline, or whatever you want to call it.
&gt;  
&gt; Compared to that, questions like the following
&gt; are a tiny, insignificant little nit:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Do you have some things in the merged ontology that are not found here?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (e.g. holes).
&gt; 
&gt; We still haven't answered where the concepts of Circle, Sphere, and Cube belong.
&gt; When we know where those belong, then maybe we can begin to talk about holes in
&gt; a cube or sphere.
&gt;   
&gt; All of Ian's questions about the following list are well taken,
&gt; but that is barely scratching the surface of the ones that must
&gt; be addressed before we can put these topics into some ordering:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Thing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.1. Individual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.1.1. State

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.1.2.2. Event
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2. Collection
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1. Class
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.1. Class of Individual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.1.1. Quantifiable Property

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.2.2. Class of Relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.2.2.1. Specialisation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.2.2.2. Unit of Measure Mapping of Property to Number Space
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.2.2.3. Class of Representation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.2.2.3.1. Identification
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.2.2.3.2. Definition
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.2.2.3.3. Description
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3. Relation
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.1. Classification
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.2. Cause and Effect
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3. Whole-Part
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.1. Fusion Whole-Part
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.2. Arrangement Whole-Part
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.3. Assembly Whole-Part
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.4. Feature Whole-Part
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.5. Temporal Whole-Part
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.6. Participation in Activity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.7. Temporal Bounding of State
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.3.8. Containment of Individual
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.4. Connection
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.5. Temporal Sequence
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.1.3.6. Involvement in Activity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.2.2. Set
&gt; 
&gt; Every level of this outline raises very serious questions about why things
&gt; are placed on that level, how they are related to their siblings or their
&gt; parents and children.  Why, for example, is "period of time" under "state"?
&gt; What is time?  Why is "cause and effect" a sibling node of "whole-part"?
&gt; What is causality?  How does causality relate to time?  Which is more
&gt; fundamental, time or causality?  Which one presupposes the other
&gt; in its definition?  Why?
&gt; 
&gt; Having a laundry list of items to be considered is useful.
&gt; But without a very serious answer to all these questions,
&gt; it should not considered as anything that has any more
&gt; structure than a laundry list.
&gt;
