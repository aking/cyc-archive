Adam,

As I said in my note to Bob, sometimes the best is the enemy of the
good.  And "just picking" a decent solution is often appropriate.
Some comments on your comments:

JS&gt;&gt;Some people have suggested that we just "pick" one of the more
&gt; &gt;popular axiomatizations as the basis for SUMO (the SUO Merged
&gt; &gt;Ontology).  But any choice we pick is going to be wrong for
&gt; &gt;many applications.

AP&gt; I think that's just too strong a rejoinder.  I would agree that any
&gt; ontology that we decide on is going to have some tradeoffs that might make
&gt; portions less that optimal for a particular application.  However, I'd
&gt; suggest that all application specific ontologies will need to made
&gt; extensions anyway and so should be able, through composition of upper level
&gt; concepts, to create the concepts which are most natural for that application.

I didn't mean that as a criticism of SUMO in particular, but a
criticism of any ontology that only supports one option.  As I
said in the series of notes about Phil J's "irregular concepts",
there is no single axiomatization that can be used for any naturally
occurring concept.
 
AP&gt; To say that a particular ontology is "wrong" I think requires a
firmer
&gt; definition of "wrong" and identification of a serious logical error, such
&gt; as a contradiction which is derivable from the ontology.

I said "wrong for many applications".  The axioms in a given
ontology, such as SUMO, may be consistent in themselves, but they
may be inconsistent with the definitions required for some application.
They would therefore be wrong for that application, although they
might be good for some other application.
 
AP&gt; A somewhat weaker criticism might be that a particular ontology is
&gt; "inefficient" or "inelegant" which might correspond to an operational
&gt; definition that some set of examples can be faithfully represented by less
&gt; statements in ontology X than ontology Y.

I wasn't even considering those issues.  I believe that any merged
ontology will have to support something like the lattice of all
possible theories, which we have been discussing on many SUO notes.
There will be some concept types, such as Space or Number, which
correspond to different formally defined predicates with different
axioms in different theories in the lattice.

JS&gt;&gt;For those reasons, I believe that a terminological ontology,
&gt; &gt;somewhat at the level of WordNet or EDR is valuable as an index
&gt; &gt;to the terms that are needed.
&gt; 
AP&gt; Our charter is to create an ontology which, among other attributes,
is
&gt; suitable for logic inference.  A terminological ontology is too weak for
&gt; that.  Of course, one might say that our charter is wrong, but that would
&gt; be a different issue.

The point I was making is that we can use a large terminological
ontology, such as WordNet or something developed from that, as an
index to a collection of different axiomatizations for the various
word senses.  WordNet itself couldn't support detailed logical
inferences, but it could be used to find candidate axioms and
theories that could.

JS&gt; &gt;Instead of having a single collection
&gt; &gt;of axioms, I believe that the SUO or SUMO should contain a hierarchy
&gt; &gt;of selected theories, each of which is consistent internally but
&gt; &gt;possibly inconsistent with other theories in the same hierarchy.
&gt; 
AP&gt; I agree with that, with the caveat that I believe such
inconsistencies can
&gt; be minimized to the point where they will be rare.  This is something that
&gt; must be shown empirically though.

I'll stop on this point of agreement.  My basic point is that I
believe we can use a terminological ontology at the level of
WordNet as an indexing mechanism for finding the more detailed
microtheories (in Guha's sense) that are appropriate.  I believe
that SUMO must be able to accommodate multiple, possible inconsistent
microtheories just as Cyc has done.  

But I agree that more empirical work should be done to determine
just where and how any compromises may have to be made.

John Sowa
