&gt; 
&gt; Jon,
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with the sentiment:
&gt; 
&gt; JA&gt; I think it is practically essential that the SUO embody
&gt; &gt;   a "soundly understood ontology" of mathematical objects,
&gt; &gt;   in particular, relations and tuples, especially since
&gt; &gt;   these sorts of objects, notions, constructs, concepts,
&gt; &gt;   or whatever you wish to call them, are the very sorts
&gt; &gt;   of things that are typically used to build models of
&gt; &gt;   other sorts of stuff in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, as a basis for the SUO, we have already made a decision to adopt
&gt; predicate calculus, as mapped into notations such as KIF, CGs, SQL,
&gt; OIL, DAML, RDF, UML, etc., etc., etc.  Arguing about that point is
&gt; futile, since the computers of the world are geared up to process
&gt; relations, tuples, graphs, and related data structures.  There are
&gt; many suggestions for going to other kinds of things, such as neural
&gt; networks, virtual reality, and quantum computing, but they will not
&gt; replace the tuples for a long time.

When we talk of "predicate calculus" we are, of course,
speaking with a "forked tongue", as Tonto and some of
my ancestors are widely reputed to have said, that is,
we always speak of our ideal and our ultimate calculus,
but half embodied and half embalmed in its real and its
present implementations.  Such a practice make our practice
almost immune to any brand of criticism, since every reflection
on the actual is cast aside as an aspersion of our good intentions,
if not a blasphemy against our noblest aspirations.  In this manner,
the name of "predicate calculus", indeed, the very title of "logic"
itself, are elevated to the status of notions like "democracy", and
all of those other sacred cows, mad as they are at times, or not.

&gt; The big issue for the SUO is how to map the world in all its glory,
&gt; pomp, circumstance, and messy details into tuples.
&gt; 
&gt; JA&gt; But before the SUO comes to embody such an understanding,
&gt; &gt;   it will be needful for those who construct or design it
&gt; &gt;   to arrive at such an understanding themselves, and our
&gt; &gt;   current discussions around the topics of relations and
&gt; &gt;   tuples do not, from my perspective, appear to reflect
&gt; &gt;   any such understanding yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that there are many issues on which we have not yet
&gt; reached closure.  In particular, I agree with you about the
&gt; need for triadic representations.  However, I have stopped
&gt; pushing that idea on SUO list because enough bits have been
&gt; spilled on this topic already.

It is not really my nature to go looking for trouble --
whenever I find myself up presented with some obstinate
obstruction, my first thought is to look for a quick and
easy, even sneaky, way around it.  But I can tell you that
I exhausted all of the raisonable detours around this problem
at least ten years ago, and now there is nothing left for me to
do but to try and tackle this caltrop in my path, and to try and
melt it down by sheer intensity of recalcitrant and refractory work.
I really wish there was another way.  There does not appear to be one.

&gt; My current strategy is to stop wasting time
&gt; arguing about the abstractions.   Instead,
&gt; I am working on answering another challenge:
&gt; how do those triads support actual language
&gt; and reasoning about representation, causality,
&gt; purpose, beliefs, desires, intentions, agents,
&gt; social interactions, etc.?   There is a lot of
&gt; very hard work to do in writing definitions that
&gt; represent the hundreds of thousands of word senses
&gt; in English and other languages.  It would be useful
&gt; to show how the theory could represent just a few
&gt; word senses -- ideally more than one, but even one
&gt; would be better than none.

I guess that I have failed to convey the extent to which things like
functions and relations, abstract as they may be in the abstract, are
real, live, concrete, and implementable objects for me.  My whole way of
programming, though it now appears that I may never get back to it again,
is based on them.  Twenty year ago, I began my first serious AI work with
what I thought of as a "procedurally implemented relational" (PIR) style,
but the programming languages on hand (Lisp and then Pascal) forced me to
develop a "functionally implemented relational state transition" (FIRST)
style of architecture, as the most reasonable compromise that I was able
to work out.  So when I write a predicate or a proposition as a function
"q : X -&gt; B", I am literally always thinking about a program for q that
responds to elements of X with replies in the range of B.  There is,
of course, all of the usual stuff regarding the syntax of these q's
to worry about, but if I did not think that there were programs to
program and to run for these q's, I do not think I would bother.
Perhaps this is a source for many of the misunderstandings that
arise between me and other members of this group:  for me, the
name "and" really is the name of a program that has to compute
its duty at every appropriate place where it is invoked in the
functional discombobulation of a complex functional program,
and so to blow it off as a mere "connective" smacks of the
manner of syntactically abstract absent-mindedness, if not
utter "forgetfulness of being" (FOB), computationally and
existentially speaking, that I have worked for many years,
the pale cast of which to cast off.

&gt; JA&gt; Thus, I would like to dedicate this thread, not in the sense
&gt; &gt;   of "in memoriam", I hope, but in the sense of concerted work,
&gt; &gt;   to the task of coming to a "solidly underfoot organization"
&gt; &gt;   of these concepts.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck.  But it is important to emphasize the pragmatic results:
&gt; how can the abstract theory lead to better ways of representing,
&gt; talking about, and reasoning about the problems that the SUO
&gt; people are trying to solve?

See above.

&gt; The best collaboration has to work both ways:  the people with the
&gt; problems have to explain what they need to represent, and the people
&gt; with the theories have to show, in detail, how their theories can help
&gt; to solve the problems.  And a lot of iterative work with I/O in both
&gt; directions will be necessary.

I am afraid that, unless we get some really good theorem-o-stats on board --
a good one is one that notifies us when a simple contradiction is brewing --
and until we are consulting them on a routine basis, then most of the time
that we try to cook up any half-way complex stew of axioms, we will be, for
long periods of time unwittingly, just blowing smoke.  All our bravado about
iterative cycling is rather precocious until we get some wheels on our trike.

&gt; John Sowa
&gt; 
&gt; PS:  By the way, thank you for writing in boring, but readable English.

With that brand of review, I will consider
myself reinforced in this more boring vein.
Caveat:  Just be careful for what you wish!

Jon Awbrey
