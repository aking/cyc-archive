Taken together these rules do not cohere, though in isolation each might
seem reasonable. For example, the proposed rule eliminating quorum
requirements entirely does not cohere with a high seconding requirement of
five votes to apply to even technical objections.  (We could in principle
have votes in which only four people participated counted as valid, while
four people would not suffice to object to the result).

Is there some e-mail template that has worked elsehwere ("a best
practice")  that we can adopt?

Note also, that there earlier seemed consensus on working on multiple
documents, in which working subgroups might contain very few members.  If
we are to improvise our own rules in any area, it would seem best to
concentrate this effort on setting facilitating rules for the smooth
operation of subgroups.

&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Since we may have some votes coming up, let's see if we agree on how
&gt; Robert's Rules of Order should apply to email votes.  The interpretations I
&gt; have always seen include:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  The concept of 'quorum' does not apply to email votes, since everyone
&gt; (or at least far more than half) can be presumed to have received email
&gt; notification of the vote.   Another way to view this is as a 'letter
&gt; ballot,' for quick a 'quorum' does not apply (because they are sent to
&gt; everyone).     I believe this is the widely accepted practice for email
&gt; groups.  Comment?

&gt; 
&gt; 2. ABSTAINS are not counted in determining the outcome of a vote.  What
&gt; counts is the ratio of YES to No votes.  
&gt; 
&gt; 3. I believe we should require more than one 'second' to conduct a vote.  A
&gt; vote in a physical meeting can take 15 seconds, but via email it can take
&gt; weeks. I suggest the level of support should be about half as many votes as
&gt; would be needed for that position to prevail.  I have previously posted a
&gt; complicated formula for determining this number, but I'm now thinking we
&gt; should just pick a number (about 5)  and change it later if the groups
&gt; wants.    The clause might (this is not yet a motion) read, "A total of 5
&gt; voting members must support a motion or amendment before it can be brought
&gt; to a vote."    
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  In the past, we have made many minor decisions without voting, by the
&gt; Chair saying, "Does anyone object to ..."  Once we have some documents in
&gt; development, the Technical Editors will also need to determine rough
&gt; consensus without taking numerous votes.    Under RRO, as Bob has educated
&gt; us, a single objection forces a vote.  I believer a greater number should be
&gt; required and suggest about 5.  The clause might read, "The Chair or
&gt; Technical Editor may determine consensus by asking if there are any
&gt; objections to a motion, proposal, or position.  If 5 or more object, the
&gt; item is not accepted."  
&gt; Comments?  
&gt; 

&gt; Comments.
