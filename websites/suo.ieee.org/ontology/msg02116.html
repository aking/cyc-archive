&gt; &gt; Dear Lee,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since I do not view your position as philosophically or
&gt; &gt; &gt; logically adequate
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the full range of human experience,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: I note this. What I lack is evidence or proof that your view is
&gt; &gt; correct. If you can identify where the position is inadequate and
&gt; &gt; which ranges of human experience it does not apply to then we might
&gt; &gt; make progress.
&gt; 
&gt; There was a Polish philosopher named Tadeusz Kotarbinski who took
&gt; something like your position to great lengths.  He variously called
&gt; his position reism, pan-somatism, concretism, semantic reism.  Tarski,
&gt; insofar as he bothered to work out a metaphysical position, acknowledged
&gt; Kotarbinski as his master and his early and famous work on truth in formal
&gt; systems is couched to make place for a reist approach.
&gt; 
&gt; I once spent a good bit of effort to show how this position, which is not
&gt; my own, can be stretched to cover just about anything, including ethics and
&gt; aesthetics.  But it has one great limitation that may have some bearing on
&gt; an SUO effort.  It covers experience after the fact, after the experience
&gt; has become manifest in some spatio-temporal phenomenon.

I think that the catch -- aside from the fact that 3-adic relations
just do not in general discombobulate in any fashion over 2-adics --
is that we would have to reside at the "End Locus Of Inquiry" (ELOI),
say, in the year 802,701 or thereabouts, before we can even begin to
think of enjoying such a blithe perspective on history after the fact --
and, of course, there is a price to pay for such blissful gnosis, but
never mind that now -- in effect, we would have to be in possession of
perfect information about what has passed before, as if what has perished
could ever be completely manifest in experince, and in the meantime we are
just kidding ourselves to pretend this, as perfect information, even about
the past, even if we could ever have it, could only be in the future for us.

&gt; It thus sees little point in asserting experience, human or otherwise,
&gt; as a broader category than empiria.  Thus in your recent exchange on
&gt; 'giving' with Chris Menzel, you cover giving after an act of giving
&gt; has become manifest, while Chris would like to assert some ternary
&gt; aspect to the logic of giving, or in natural language to the dative
&gt; case, whether or not it is made manifest in an activity.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I would not argue that you fail to 'cover' giving, since you can
&gt; provide a verbal account of each and every instance after it occurs,
&gt; and once an act has occurred to every 'extension' of it in the sense
&gt; you use this term, but I would argue that there is something about
&gt; the logic of the dative case that is missing in your view of it.
&gt; And I would also argue what is missing in the binary view of
&gt; giving is also missing in the binary treatment of other
&gt; concepts crucial to an account of human institutions,
&gt; including the institution of science.
&gt; 
&gt; With respect to a computational ontology to be used in
&gt; conjunction with a relational database, my argument may
&gt; make no practical difference so long as we are interested
&gt; in using the ontology to search and mine what has already
&gt; been achieved and certified in some sense as information.
&gt; But to the extent that we may wish to use an ontological
&gt; artifact for sciences of discovery or for deliberation,
&gt; which contain a purely hypothetical or even imaginative
&gt; element, and in which we wish to be especially alert
&gt; to emergent categories and to the repurposing and
&gt; reconceptualizing of information for unanticipated
&gt; needs, we may want to provide architectonically
&gt; for a position that concedes a degree of reality
&gt; to concepts without grounding them dogmatically in
&gt; some 'concrete' manifestation and its extensions.
&gt; 
&gt; I am, of course, able to participate cheerfully in an ontology
&gt; constructed on principles in the general family to which your
&gt; position belongs, so long as the purpose of the effort is
&gt; clarified to be limited to uses for which this position
&gt; is appropriate.  But if, as in our current effort, there
&gt; is strong resistance to narrowing the purpose, I would
&gt; counsel that what I would regard as a more capacious
&gt; and open-ended view not be ruled out prematurely.
&gt; 
&gt; Lee
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am trying to locate the virtue of your position, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to have been well thought out, by construing it as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adequate some to more limited range of human experience --
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in this case, experience with trying to represent a portion
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of experience within the limitations of relational databases.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW:  You should see this as part of the history of how we arrived here,
&gt; &gt;      rather than as a guiding principle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought that this was also the
&gt; &gt; &gt; virtue that Frederick Chase saw in it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MW: Fred seems to understand some of the background I come from.
