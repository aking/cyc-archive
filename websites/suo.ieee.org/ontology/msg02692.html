<br>Jon, I don't know why you insist on translating the term "mind" into
"a person's mind" each time that it appears in a definition.&nbsp; Peirce
writes in another text (MS 787)&nbsp;"What is mind except a faculty for
ideas?". If 'mind' only means 'the mind of a person' to you, then I understand
your position, but you must be aware of the fact that Peirce did not use
the term in such a restricted way.
<p>Simply go through the "76 definitions" assembled at <A HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm</A>&nbsp;
and you will see that the term 'mind'&nbsp; or 'thought' or 'interpreting
thought'&nbsp; appears not only in "the-sop-to-cerberus" definition, but
in nearly all of them,which are the pragmatic definitions. The only definitions
that do not have 'mind' in them are the formal ones that use the term 'correlate',
or 'C' or whatever-you-like-to-call-it.
<p>I&nbsp;have no problem in understanding the difference between a formal
definition that is as general as possible and needs not refer to anything
existing in particular and its application in practice, so I&nbsp;believe
that the discussion on whether the definition of a sign should be either
purely abstract and formal or more specialized by referring to a 'mind'
in general is of no interest whatsoever, except for theorists who can't
make the link between theory and practice.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"What is a sign?&nbsp;" Try and answer that question using the pragmatic
maxim. What are all the imaginable effects of a sign?&nbsp;Do they affect
only abstract correlates in a formula?

<p>Jean-Marc,
<p>Every technical writer who has ever dared to write up an adaptation
<br>for a particular audience, an application to a specialized subdomain,
<br>or a popularization of his or her own technical work, no doubt looks
<br>forward to a reader such as you -- that would be irony if I let it
<br>go at that, so I won't -- with fear and trembling and a sickness
<br>unto death.&nbsp; If you were a new and unknown person to me, and
<br>this were the very first time that the topic had come up in
<br>our conversations, I would now dutifully trudge off, like
<br>some Hansel in the forest, to gather up all of the clearly
<br>labelled sops that truth-in-adversizing demands and that
<br>Cerberus had yet omitted to gobble up, and I would then
<br>politely explain the facts of life to you, in so far as
<br>they concern anyone who finds occasion to write several
<br>variations on the same theme, to wit, that it is only
<br>the approximate whole of a person's work that must be
<br>read in the context of itself, its immediate audience,
<br>and its mediate purpose.&nbsp; But we are past that point,
<br>thee and me, and so I no longer feel the need to be
<br>dutiful or even polite.&nbsp; I am not one of those whose
<br>suckers for that bit of a fish-monger's red herring
<br>about the fights that the Old Peirce was supposed
<br>to have had with the Young Peirce -- it is only
<br>the struggle between the popular Elvis and the
<br>real Elvis, and everybody knows how that song
<br>goes, leastwise, anybody who has been paying
<br>attention and chooses to apply a modicum of
<br>good sense to the issues of interpretation.
<p>Get Real!
<p>Jon
