Jon, 
	.	Not only that, but please also explicitly between the
instance, cardinality, concept, class, etc., etc. 

	.	We have had much needless arguments over apparent conflicts
over what has turned out to be unrelated issues as a result of the
inadequacy of just this sort of qualification of terms used.

&gt; Rather we are arguing for them.

&gt; Dear Matthew,  I must correct your statement below [above].
&gt; You may speak of "actual relations" in contrast to "relations".
&gt; I think I understand and agree with what you mean, and consistently
&gt; use "relationship" as the word for that concept, precisely to distinguish
&gt; it from relation.  I agree we are both arguing for what Mike is asking
for.

May I suggest a practice that has been "standard"
in all of the "upper" classes of good society --
by that I mean your humble programmar schools --
for about as long as I can remember, or have ever
even read about in my history books?

Use the least adorned names possible to describe objects,
that is, whatever things are the objects of your discourse,
and use significant substantives like "name" or "sign" to
mark those additional objects in your universe of discourse
which happen to be the corresponding names or signs, that is,
I am having to guess here, those things that you place in what
you call the "representation space" -- another usage, by the way,
that if it is not circumscribed extremely carefully, will occasion
the misunderstanding of just about everybody in the mathematical
sub-community, but never mind that now -- thus generating pairs
in a paradigm like this:

Now, I realize that this paradigm is extremely tedious
in the almost obsessive degree of its redundancy, and
that it exhibits a startling lack of creativity on my
part to be trying to follow it, moreover, I am fully
cognizant of all of the minor wrinkles in its seemingly
smooth consistency, like the singular vacuity at the site
of the (com)putative object that is listed as a "variable",
but that is a matter that can be taken up in a separate
pleading, and does not detract from the overall utility
of this rather common, perhaps all too pragmatic scheme.

Furthermore, this way of laying out the terminology
has the not inconsiderable advantage that it avoids
the trap of confounding the dimensions of "reality"
and "relation" with the dimension of "representation".

After all, the relations that there are among objects
include among their number the relations that there are
among all of the sorts of objects that happen to be signs,
as yet another special case of their very generic category.
In sum, this means that the aspect of being a reality,
the business of being a relation, an the concern for
being a representation are "independent issues", and
are best therefore not confounded by our nomenclature.

Just A Suggestion,

Jon Awbrey
