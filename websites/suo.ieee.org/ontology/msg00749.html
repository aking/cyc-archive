&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;	Below is my response to Pat Hayes' criticism.  It does repeat some
&gt;points that I've made in earlier postings, but I thought it would be
&gt;worthwhile to try to collect these points into a single reply.

Thanks for doing so. I will try to respond in a similarly organised fashion.

&gt;
&gt;I agree that a methodology of simply adjoining concepts and axioms from
&gt;disparate sources would be fundamentally flawed.  However, this is not what
&gt;I tried to do.  I attempted to integrate the axioms/subsumption
&gt;relationships of various ontologies into the same stock of concepts (taken
&gt;from a simplified version of John Sowa's upper-level ontology).  In detail,
&gt;the procedure I used is as follows.  The first step was to convert all of
&gt;the ontologies listed on the SUO Candidate Content web page
&gt;(<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>) into SUO-KIF.  Once this was
&gt;accomplished, I selected the most general ontology (John Sowa's upper level
&gt;ontology) as the base ontology.  I then mapped concepts/axioms from the
&gt;remaining ontologies into the base ontology.  In this mapping process, there
&gt;were two possible cases, each in turn with two subcases.
&gt;
&gt;1.  New content (Nothing in the merged ontology corresponds with the
&gt;concept/axiom to be mapped)
&gt;
&gt;  	a. Useful/Relatively Noncontroversial content.  In this subcase, the
&gt;new concept/axiom is deemed to 	be useful and not to violate 
&gt;any cherished
&gt;philosophical principles.  Once I decided that the new 
&gt;	concept/axiom should
&gt;be included, it was simply a matter of finding a place for it in the
&gt;ontology.

OK, on what basis do you decide what the appropriate place for it is 
in that heirarchy? For example, consider the mereotopological 'part' 
relation and the things it applies to. Must these be continuants or 
occurents, or both, or neither? I can see arguments all ways, but no 
clear answer. What were your guiding principles for making these 
choices?

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;	b. Useless/Controversial content.  In this subcase, the new
&gt;concept/axiom is judged (by me) to be 	either not useful or too
&gt;controversial for incorporation into a schema that we hope will have both
&gt;broad application and wide acceptance.  This is of course a very subjective
&gt;judgement, but ontology 	merging/alignment is probably much more of
&gt;an art than a science.

Ok, fair enough. (As an aside, it might be useful to keep files of 
this 'rejected' content for future consideration. No doubt you are 
already doing that...)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;2.  Old Content (There is some degree of overlap between the merged ontology
&gt;and the concept/axiom to be     mapped)
&gt;
&gt;	a.  Perfect Overlap.  In this case, the terms may differ but the new
&gt;concept has the same semantic 	content as a concept already in the merged
&gt;ontology or, with respect to axioms, there is a logical 	equivalence
&gt;between the new axiom and an existing axiom.  An example of this sort of
&gt;case occurs in 	the various mereotopological theories.  Some 
&gt;philosophers
&gt;use 'part-of' as the primitive notion to 	frame their axioms, some use
&gt;'overlaps', and still others use some notion of 'connection'. 
&gt;	However, in
&gt;many cases, axioms across these different systems are logically equivalent.

Well, this is where I start to worry, since this is an area where we 
have found very complex and tricky relationships between alternative 
formulations. For example, if one theory uses an 'adjacency' 
relationship but another defines adjacent as sharing a common 
boundary, then the two theories are likely to be incommensurate, in 
that they are quantifying over different universes, so the 
translation between them becomes very complicated to state. Its not 
impossible, let me emphasise, just *difficult* to get right; the 
axioms of one have to be rewritten in a completely different form to 
make them compatible with the other.

&gt;	b.  Partial Overlap.  In this case, there is some overlap in meaning
&gt;between the new content and 	existing concepts or axioms in the merged
&gt;ontology.  An example of this is the case role hierarchy.  	Although
&gt;John Sowa's system of case roles was part of the base ontology (and, hence,
&gt;the original 	merged ontology), I tried to simplify it somewhat to make it
&gt;more like other systems of case roles.  	Both systems follow:

&lt;big snip&gt;

Again, I am (honestly) impressed by what you have done, but I still 
don't really know on what *basis* you have done it.  Suppose someone 
asked me to justify your choice of what you have kept in and what you 
have left out: I wouldnt know what to tell him.

I realise that this sounds rather as though I am asking you do work 
even harder, when you are the only person who has done a stroke of 
work at all so far, and that hardly seems fair.  I agree, it isnt 
fair, and I wish there was something more constructive I could say. I 
really don't think that creating an SUO is a one-man job, so my 
carping about what you have done isnt meant to be a complaint about 
you personally. I don't think anyone could have done better, but 
maybe we shouldnt be trying to do it this way.
