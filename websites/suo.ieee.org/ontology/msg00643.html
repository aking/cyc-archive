Dear John,

I seem to have misunderstood your intent. Sorry. See below.

&gt; Subject: RE: More KIF-ified Ontology Content
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Graham, Matthew, Chris P., Lee, et al.,
&gt; 
&gt; My suggestion of "naive realism" and emphasis on what can be
&gt; expressed in KIF was not intended to disparage or eliminate
&gt; philosophy, metaphysics, or metalanguage about how language
&gt; relates to the world.

MW: Good.
&gt; 
&gt; My primary intention was to draw a sharp distinction between
&gt; the definitions and axioms that are expressed in KIF and the
&gt; metalevel talk about them.  When we get down to what is
&gt; expressed in KIF (or any similar language, such as predicate
&gt; calculus, conceptual graphs, and many other formalisms),
&gt; most, if not all, of the metalevel discussions become
&gt; irrelevant -- i.e., they don't make any difference in how
&gt; KIF is used to define and apply the ontology.

MW: I suspect I disagree with this. I think it is quite important to discuss
alternative ways in which real world things should be represented. It is
then important to be consistent in representing the same sort of thing in
the same way (within some paradigm).
&gt; 
&gt; Example of a typical question:  "Is an activity a relation?"
&gt; The answer to that question is no, because a relation is a
&gt; term that is used to describe KIF, and an activity is something
&gt; to be described by the ontology.  Different topics -- different
&gt; languages -- different terms.

MW: The proper question though is "Is a relation a good representation of an
activity in KIF?"
&gt; 
&gt; But if you use KIF to make statements about activities, then
&gt; you will have to use relations to represent activities and
&gt; whatever you want to say about them.  

MW: I agree with the latter, but not the former.

&gt; In English, you can use
&gt; a noun to talk about an activity, but that does not make an
&gt; activity a noun.  Similarly, you don't make an activity a
&gt; relation by using a relation in KIF to say something about it.

MW: yes, this is why I keep using the word "representation" instead of "is".
&gt; 
&gt; Another question that keeps coming up is whether we should use
&gt; a 4-dimensional representation or a 3-D + time representation.
&gt; My answer is simple:  both. 

MW: I agree.

&gt; For some purposes, a 4D rep is
&gt; better; for others, it is better to use 3D + time. 

MW: I don't know when 3D plus time is better than 4D, but I would want to
support 3D plus time, because that is where lots of people are.

&gt; There is
&gt; no contradiction between them because you can express both
&gt; systems in KIF, and you can write KIF expressions to convert
&gt; one into the other.  

MW: Being able to be written in KIF is not a definition of compatibility.
After all I can say black is white in KIF if I want to.

MW: I agree that most statements can be mapped between them.

&gt; There are some statements in one that do
&gt; not have a simple, direct conversion; so those you don't
&gt; convert.

MW: I agree
&gt; 
&gt; The difference is very much like the distinction in fluid
&gt; mechanics between Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinate systems.
&gt; In one, you look at a little bit of fluid, and follow its
&gt; motion around the system.  In the other, you look at a single
&gt; point and watch the fluid that flows past.  Some problems
&gt; are easier to express in one system than in the other, but
&gt; there are ways to convert from one to the other.  And both
&gt; of them can be expressed in KIF, or CGs, or English, or
&gt; whatever.

MW: I don't agree with this analysis. I think it is more like Newtonian and
post Newtonian physics, one can provide a deeper understanding of the other.
But this is not a critical point, and we will find out the truth as time
porgresses (I sincerely hope).
&gt; 
&gt; If we focus on what is expressed in KIF, many of the
&gt; long-winded arguments become moot because they don't make
&gt; a difference to what is finally written down in axioms and
&gt; definitions.  That doesn't mean that those arguments might
&gt; not be useful for motivation, intuition, insight into what
&gt; is going on, or some sort of methodology for ontology design
&gt; and development.

MW: Again, I think the discussion is important to achieve consistency.
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line:  Before getting lost in heated arguments, look at
&gt; what difference that discussion will make in the final result.
&gt; No difference -- no problem.

MW: Agreed. But we seem to differ about what might cause a difference.
