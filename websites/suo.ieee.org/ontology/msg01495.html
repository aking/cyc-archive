(This is reply is quite delayed because of interruptions.  Still, I wanted
to get on the record.)

Chris,

Good questions.  I've clearly been guilty of (a) assuming people
would understand what I thought I meant when I didn't explain
myself, and (b) vague thinking I wasn't completely aware of.

See embedded comments below.

Regards,

John Velman

&gt;
&gt;John,
&gt;
&gt;I happen to agree with your position.
&gt;But it needs to made clearer.
&gt;Are these 'things':
&gt;1) physical objects or do they include
&gt;2) regions of space-time, where these are not physical objects.
&gt;If you allow 2), as many people do, then every physical thing occupies a
&gt;space-time region (or space region, or whatever your view of space-time
&gt;is).
&gt;This abundance is why I favour a version of option 1).
&gt;

The short answer is (1 - physical objects).  But of course this requires a
little more explanation.  Often when we give locations of things we do this
in terms of coordinate systems of some kind.  I think coordinate systems
are abstract (but are encoded in physical objects in some way, in order to
be useful).  However, I think coordinate systems themselves are, let me
say, "anchored" by identifiable aspects of physical things.  So when I said
that "it is fundamental that things don't have locations.  They only have
locations _relative_ to other things." I was speaking very loosely (blush),
and the dependence may be rather indirect through a chain of abstractions.

(By the way  Shape of Space - Graham Nerlich that you
referred me to earlier has been shipped, but hasn't
arrived yet.)

I know this is stated roughly, and is going to take some time to work out.
Probably should be deferred till we start dealing seriously with
measurements and coordinate systems.

&gt;However, I think it makes sense to agree on the ontological architecture -
&gt;vis a vis space and time - BEFORE discussing location. Or using location to
&gt;clarify what choice of ontological architecture on is going to make.
&gt;

It certainly influences the way you talk about them!  Certainly, one should
have an architecture in mind (and express it clearly) before discussing
location.

&gt;Regards,
&gt;Chris

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I've snipped most of the following, and left only the snippet I want to
&gt;comment on
&gt;just now.
&gt;
&gt;It seems to me that it is fundamental that things don't have locations.
&gt;They only
&gt;have locations _relative_ to other things.   (This harks back to John
&gt;Sowa's list
&gt;of coordinate systems or coordinate free alternatives of a day or so back.)
&gt;
&gt;There is a function  underlying _where_ that is a binary function, for
&gt;example,
&gt;                separation(x,y).
&gt;
&gt;(Sorry, I can read some KIF but can't write it yet.).
&gt;
&gt;Then there would be functions from whatever is in the range of _separation_
&gt; to the real numbers,  so we would have, for example,
&gt;                  miles(separation(me,home))= 15.
&gt;
&gt;It isn't too far from here to being able to define coordinate frames.
&gt;I'll try
&gt;to put some rigor behind this as an exercise for myself.
&gt;
&gt;Similar comments apply to the time dimension.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;.....
&gt;
&gt;OK, this sounds like a good name, and I like the idea of a function from
&gt;things to their locations.  Note though that the two functions won't be
&gt;exactly analogous, since the locative function will require an extra
&gt;argument, viz. a point in time or a time interval.
&gt;
