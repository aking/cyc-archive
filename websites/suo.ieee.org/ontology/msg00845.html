&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Ontology Parts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     - A series of parts, each probably quite small
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       (smaller than the Ian Niles document) that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       can be used in groups together for particular
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       purposes.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, the "Merged Ontology" is comprised of nine relatively
&gt; &gt; &gt; self-contained sections, viz. "Structural Ontology", "General
&gt; &gt; &gt; Classes and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Axioms", "Agent Hierarchy", "Number Hierarchy", "Units of 
&gt; Measure",
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Organism Hierarchy", "Temporal Definitions/Axioms", 
&gt; "Mereotopological
&gt; &gt; &gt; Definitions/Axioms", and "Positional Relations".  Are you
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying that we
&gt; &gt; &gt; need a more fine-grained division that this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: This is a problem (I think) with KIF first of all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What I am saying is that it is already clear that a 
&gt; monolithic ontology will
&gt; &gt;become unmanageable, if it hasn't already become so. I think 
&gt; we need what I
&gt; &gt;think John has described as a Lattice of Theorems, or at least my
&gt; &gt;interpretation of what he meant. That is that each theorem 
&gt; should be managed
&gt; &gt;as a separate piece of KIF - this give manageability. But we 
&gt; also need to
&gt; &gt;know as part of the theorem, which other theorems it is 
&gt; dependent on (I
&gt; &gt;think we can allow dependence to be inherited).
&gt; 
&gt; Im not quite clear what you mean by 'dependent on' here. If you mean 
&gt; 'could resolve with and produce a conclusion', then almost everything 
&gt; is going to depend on almost everything else.

MW: I guess I mean if you use a concept in a theory that is "declared" in
another theory. I appreciate this can be seen as arbitrary, but I see an
engineering issue here rather than an ontological one. So for example:

Theory Top
Uses          &lt;- uses no other theories
(subclassof thing class)
(subclassof thing individual)
(subclassof thing relation)
end theory

Theory physical object
Uses Top
(subclassof physical-object individual)
end theory

This means that you can chunk the ontology in some sensible way, not because
you have to for theoretical reasons, but because it is helpful in organising
it to do this. Clearly theories could be bigger than these, which are
strictly for example only.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;This implies that we need
&gt; &gt;constructs in KIF to support this. So we need to be able to define a
&gt; &gt;collection of KIF statements as a theory, and be able to 
&gt; give in a theory
&gt; &gt;the list of other theories it is dependent on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You do not have any of this structure even informally, so no 
&gt; user would know
&gt; &gt;which bits of the SUO he needs if say he is just interested in holes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If this can already be done with KIF as it is, I would appreciate an
&gt; &gt;explaination.
&gt; 
&gt; KIF does not of itself provide this structure, but software could be 
&gt; written to extract it automatically. Cycorp have extensive tools to 
&gt; allow the user to 'browse' through a large axiomatic Kbase, including 
&gt; such facilities as asking for a concept related to an existing 
&gt; concept, view and navigate through the (highly complex) class 
&gt; heirarchy, and see all axioms which mention a concept or group of 
&gt; concepts. It takes some getting used to (its considerably more 
&gt; complex than hyperlinks), but one can do most of what one wants to do 
&gt; in this kind of framework. I honestly don't think we can expect to do 
&gt; much better, and to develop usable tools like this is not a job to be 
&gt; undertaken lightly: it is many man-years of effort. No large ontology 
&gt; is going to fall apart neatly into separate theories which can be 
&gt; taken or left in isolation. 

MW: I agree, that is why we need to know which other bits a theory "takes
for granted"

&gt; The SUO isnt going to have 'bits', its 
&gt; going to be more like a kind of large network, with some areas more 
&gt; tangled than others.

MW: I accept that. Again my concern is an engineering one first and
foremost.
