Pat,

It is disappointing to see this turn of events. The relationship between
natural language, thought, and ontology has been frequently discussed in
this group. As a result of a recent correspondence you have written:

	PH: "Since the statement of purpose is so clear on this, and other
issues that I think are wrongheaded (that an SUO can be 'neutral'; the idea
that particular applications are 'constructed on' the upper-level concepts),
misguided (the idea that there can be an SUO for education - horrifying, in
fact) , just plain technically mistaken (that an SUO - emphasis on U - will
produce interoperability; the error in B3 that confuses an ontology with a
notation) , and pointless; and since my sincerely held belief has always
been that the world would be *much* better off with no 'standard' upper
ontology than with a bad one, and since the current process seems more and
more likely to produce an extremely bad one, I think it is probably best if
I follow Adam's advice and withdraw from these SUO activities."

I'd just like to say that I disagree, and think it would be far better for
the group if you could continue participating, because that could lead to a
much stronger result. 

It seems to me that, perhaps due to the limitations of NL as a medium, we
have been missing some perspectives and perhaps fallen into some logical
errors in this debate.

First, just because one goal of the SUO effort is to hopefully support
disambiguation of natural language, does not mean that this goal should be
overriding, or that this goal should cause us to produce an ontology that
would be inconsistent, wrong, etc. Rather, we could take the approach that
we will work to produce the best possible ontology, from a purely
ontological perspective, and if it happens that people doing NL can use such
an ontology, then that will be great, but if it does not happen, then so be
it. People can agree to disagree about the chances that SUO's work will help
NL understanding, and still accomplish something from an ontological
perspective. People with research interests in computational semantics may
provide ideas of use to SUO from an ontological perspective.

Second, just because some people in SUO are working on ontological
approaches that you disagree with, does not mean everyone must do so, or
that SUO is destined to produce something you will not be able to support. A
lot of time and energy has gone into establishing the principle that SUO can
support multiple, parallel ontological efforts. The door is open for an
effort along lines that you could support, as well as being open for your
feedback on all of SUO's parallel efforts.

Plus, there is an existence proof that there is at least one potential
parallel ontological approach that you could support. Namely, in your post
"RE: SUO: Re: Focus and Volume" of May 15, 2001, 11:05pm, in response to my
suggestion for an approach to develop a "standard kernel ontology", you
wrote:

	PH: "I agree the following is well worth trying, particularly if
combined
	with John Sowa's recent idea of focussing on differences."

I would be very interested in developing this approach, with you and others.
As I wrote, it can shift our focus from thinking in terms of a top-down
ontological hierachy, toward thinking in terms of how concepts can be
defined in terms of other concepts, and finding a kernel of primitive
concepts and definitional mechanisms that appear to be sufficient for
defining all concepts one might need in a complete ontology.

Third, I think that in the recent correspondence on natural language and
ontology, some important middle ground has been overlooked. For example, you
wrote:

	PH: "Ontology is more like Fodor's 'language of thought' than it is
like NL. And of course the language of thought is not a natural language. If
it were, NL comprehension would be trivial: just read in the NL sentences
and store them."
This seems to correspond with something I wrote in my post "Natural
Language, Thought, and  Ontology -- RE: SUO: Proposed Changes to Merged
Ontology", February 11, 2001, 12:37 pm:
	PJ: "So, despite the evidence and arguments against thought being
based on spoken natural languages, it seems clear that human intelligence
must rely on an internal language for thinking, a "mentalese" distinct from
spoken natural languages."

	"In this case, spoken natural languages would be ways of
"serializing" mentalese concepts for communication between people. The
psychological experiments cited against the equivalence of natural language
and thought may show cases where the mechanisms for spoken language are
impaired, while the mechanisms for mentalese continue to function, or vice
versa."

	"The expressive capabilities of languages like English may reflect
the expressive capabilities of mentalese. The ability to express arbitrarily
large, recursively structured sentences is plausibly just as important in a
mentalese as it is in English. The ability to metaphorically weld concepts
together across arbitrary, multiple domains may plausibly be just as
important in a mentalese as it is in English."

	"This is not to say that mentalese would have the same limitations
as spoken natural languages. Perhaps in mentalese, sentences can have more
complex, non-sequential, graphical structures not physically permitted in
spoken languages, which might make mentalese more expressive for problems
involving spatial reasoning, etc. Perhaps in mentalese sentences can more
clearly express the kinds of logical precision possible in formal languages
like predicate calculus."

Note that in saying natural languages may be ways to "serialize" mentalese,
I do not say that *all* mentalese can be serialized by natural language.
Thus, I agree completely with your paragraph:

	PH: "There is a basic and fundamental misunderstanding here, in my
view: the idea that natural langauge and ontological formalisms are on some
kind of continuum. If you look at the requirements they must satisfy, it is
clear that they are in completely different functional spaces, and that the
requirements on them are all in completely opposite directions For example:.
NL needs to be informationally compact but can be highly ambiguous and
contextual; NL utterances are often abbreviated, gnomic, or incomplete. NL
is a language for communciation rather than representation; it does not need
to support inference. It is rich with indexical and deictic markers and
constructions, and intended to be understood in a surrounding context by
creatures with sensory abilities which need to be sharply aware of the
processing and epistemic abilities of the other creatures in their vicinity.
It uses social mechanisms like humor, repetition, emotional content, irony,
and so on. It mixes propositional utterances with commands, requests,
questions and other speech acts; it uses narrative and tensed and rhetorical
forms and God knows what else, It does not need to have a precise model
theory or even a precisely defined syntax. None of this is true for
ontological formalisms, which need to be at the opposite end of all these
dimensions. Maybe most important, ontology langauges need to be able to
represent all the stuff the is *never* said in NL because the users of NL
always assume that the listener already knows it: all the unspoken knowledge
of the world (including the stuff I once called 'naive physics', but also
naive psychology, epistemology, sociology and so on.)"

You also wrote:

	PH: "I certainly am absolutely sure that my temporal and
naive-physics work was not abstracted from NL, and most of my own everyday
thinking is so unconnected with NL that I often find it hard to even express
it in language. I suspect that there are genuine individual differences here
between people. I know many academics who feel that their entire mental life
is almost conducted in language. I know mine is not."

Again, I find it quite believable that many thoughts may be hard to express
in NL. Thus it could follow that a mentalese and ontology capable of
representing thoughts in general, would be more powerful than NL, and yet
could also support NL understanding.

So, Pat, I hope that you will reconsider based on all the above reasons, and
continue to give SUO the benefit of your thoughts. We will be much the
poorer without your help.

Sincerely,

Phil Jackson
