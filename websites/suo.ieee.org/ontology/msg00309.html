Pat, 
	.Thanks for this interesting insight to how meat is processed across
some 1st World countries. 

	.	Comments interspersed below, prefaced "GH&gt;	".

Subject:	Re: SUO: SUO - Content

&gt;Dear all,
&gt;	.	I have recently had the chance to start looking at the
&gt;content we have so far.
&gt;
&gt;	.	Jim Schoening pointed me towards some lists Ian Niles and
&gt;David Whitten have posted. These contain mainly what I think of as
&gt;"structural", rather than "semantic" content.

Can you be a bit clearer what you mean by 'semantic' here? Seems to 
me that whenever anyone writes any axiom, it is 'semantic'.

GH&gt;	By 'semantic', here, I mean relating to the meaning of the subject
matter contained in the ontology, rather than the rules by which such
material is processed and interpreted. 

&gt;.....
&gt;	.	For example, in the medical / animal biology area,
&gt;I would expect inclusion of each of the major organs and physical
&gt;features common in vertebrates, especially bearing in mind the
&gt;general commonality of these features and the frequency with
&gt;which most people deal with them (eg at a butcher's shop).

Funny you should use that example. If you take a look at Larousse
Gastronomique, you will see that the French, English and American butchers
all have different, and mutually incompatible, ways of cutting up cows into
parts. 'Flank steak', an American specialty, doesnt exist in England, for
example: the relevant muscle is cut into chunks instead of sheets there.
This is quite distinct from the fact that many animal parts have different
classifications in different cuisines. In England, tripe and liver as about
as different as one could imagine, and in the North would be bought at
different places in the market: in the US they are both 'organ meats'. 

GH&gt;	Yes, you've relay taught me something interesting here. Fortunately,
the particular pieces of flesh contain the same cell types, and perform the
same biological functions, regardless of which country the cows are in,
especially where they are the same breed of cow. If I want to increase my
iron levels prior to donating blood (which I am about to do tomorrow) I am
still likely to eat some liver, kidney or heart regardless of which country
I am in. I will admit that  if I were in Europe at present, I would probably
switch to lamb, but that's a different story. Australia banned cattle
imports from Europe decades ago when the 1st cases of BSE were ever
identified.

GH&gt;	Unlike some professions, I believe biologists are able to take their
knowledge from one such country and apply it elsewhere. In such
circumstances the content of the Ontology can be far more generic. In other
professions, things are very different, and butchery is evidently one.
Another impartment area applicable in both our countries is the legal
profession. Laws vary among even the states of our countries. Ontologies
attempting to address such areas would have to be able to not only cope with
differing laws across our countries, but in some cases even different
relations between laws and their scopes, classifications and handling, etc.
Fun eh? You'd think we were genetically different depending on which state
we come from. 

GH&gt;	For the SUO, I would expect that the depth of coverage in any field
will be reduced in the case of those where the structures and concepts are
less generic. 

Happy New Year.

Pat Hayes
