Jim, 
	.	I have raised before with you the problem of the method of
dialogue exhausting participants. 

	.	I feel things are reaching saturation / burnout point. 

	.	I am aware there are ways of reducing the plethora of
dialogue, mainly by co-ordinating contributions into fewer themes, so that
the same discussion doesn't get repeated many times (with variations) in
parallel. Although I am not an expert in that aspect of dialogue management,
one way I can think of is for each thread to be by way of a document that
gets worked on, and passed between participants. This can be either
sequentially, or in parallel using some form of document management system
such as I have experienced with Lotus Notes (which I, and I suspect most of
us, don't have at present). 

	.	Although I haven't experienced it, I gather Outlook has some
similar functionality. As Co-ordinator, Jim, I suggest it should be up to
you to introduce and manage such a system. If something like that doesn't
happen, I believe the PROJECT WILL DIE OF EXHAUSTION. 



	.	I suggest anyone wishing to respond to the suggestion below
do so by editing it into what they see as being a better approach, rather
than interspersing comments. Perhaps a good way would be to put their
changes in upper case for ease of identification. 

	.	I would be happy to do some prototyping by then trying
several ways of co-ordinating the various perspectives into some coherent
form of document, and people can then judge the results. 

	.	Of course, if anyone is aware of any mature paradigm that
could be used as an alternative, please say so. I don't want to reinvent the
wheel, but rather just find a better way of achieving our on-line goal. 






	.	Let me set out some initial perspectives on this suggestion
a bit further. We are talking about a methodology for managing e-mail
discussion used for developing a complex standard in a highly sophisticated
area.
*	Each topic gets a title, and a document defining the topic, that
aims at providing a position that resolves the issue. If consensus isn't
reached, then several perspectives are provided in the document, if
necessary one per participant. 
*	Whenever anyone diverts from the subject at hand, their contribution
gets reallocated to another topic, either existing, or a new one. 
*	Breadth of a topic is governed by the quantity of text required to
resolve any particular perspective 
*	The moderator: 
*	.	needs to be able to differentiate clearly between the
varying perspectives by accurately and precisely identifying where each
contribution fits, 
*	.	piece together and co-ordinate the contributions of
different participants, so as to minimise the number of topics / documents. 
	This takes a particular skill set not everyone has, an ability to
delineate between, and co-ordinate concepts. 
*	Each contributor: 
*	.	has a say about how their contribution is added to the
document, if necessary by providing a new perspective. and 
*	,	is responsible for the maintenance of their own perspectives
(thereby limiting the number of parallel perspectives each contributor adds
to any topic). This would be by using portions of other perspectives so as
to flesh out the parts they don't have any problems with. 
*	Each perspective in each document is not discarded until the project
is complete, lest any seemingly irrelevant issue turns out to be needed
later. Where agreement is reached, perspectives can be merged. Each document
then matures into a number of competing bases for a portion of the SUO
standard, or its supporting documents.
*	Discussions about why anything should be a particular way amount to
additional topics, and this is likely to assist others later, who can be
referred to the relevant topic to answer their query. This means that many
topics should be quite small and succinct. 

	.	This may sound like a lot of work, and it is. But, how much
work has happened even on-line to date???? How much value will be gained
from the database, or is it just some monument providing evidence that a lot
of effort was expended by a group of people 

	.	The fundamental difference to what has happened to date is
that the contributions are moulded into useful building blocks, rather than
just comprising discussion threads that resolve an issue of understanding,
and are then, effectively of no further use. This means that the formatting
must be of an exposition, rather than a discussion. Nevertheless, the number
of topics/documents would be (well) over 100. 

	.	In order to substantiate the justifications for my concern,
and the merits of abandoning the current paradigm, let me ask the following
questions. 
*	How many megabytes is the discussion database is now?
*	How many contributions does it hold?
*	What is going to be made of all the work to date? 
*	Is anyone going to sift through it? 
*	If so, HOW?

	.	I suggest that the value of the work to date is that we have
"gotten to know" both the subject area and each other to an extent that we
can now work forward on a mature and disciplined way.

	.	My reaction to the above is that it could be a way of
implementing the documents that Matthew has proposed with less effort from
all of us than the current approach. It would turn Matthew's job more into
one of editor / moderator, than author. If done well, this should be a means
of facilitating greater consensus over the resultant standard. 

	.	In addition, I suggest that it would be possible, if someone
had the energy and inclination, for an awful lot of this to be now done
retrospectively by sifting through the discussion threads to date, and
selecting the mature bits. I hesitate to suggest that anyone would actually
like to take on such a task, but I guess it's an option. 

	.	I put this suggestion up as the germ of a management concept
I believe could be both more efficient, and more productive.

	.	It isn't a mature proposal by any means, and isn't even
internally consistent, but rather contains differing options within itself.
It would require considerable refinement before implementation. Even then,
it would necessarily go through a drastic development phase based on
unforseen aspects during initial implementation.

Jon,

I too am frustrated by the volume of 
work-in-progress and evangelism re C.S. Pierce.

While I find it interesting, even fascinating, 
and while I don't question its relevance,
I have *no* funding to be working on the SUO.

So it's simply impossible for me to deal with
stream-of-consciousness stuff, however many
insights may be buried therein.

So I'd appreciate more separation of 
your SUO contributions and 
your CS Pierce scholarship.
