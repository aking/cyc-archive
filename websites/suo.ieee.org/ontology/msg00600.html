Dear Ian,

What this says to me is that given some available sources, you have done
something minimal to bring these sources into one document and eliminate any
obvious conflicts. What you do not convince me of is that you have a grand
plan of the parts of the ontology that will be required, the paradigms that
will be supported, and an approach for filling in that framework.

If we start somewhere, and move off in some direction without considering
where we are trying to get to, then there is no reason why we should arrive
at the desired place, because we don't even know how to recognise it if we
arrived there.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Below is my response to Pat Hayes' criticism.  It does 
&gt; repeat some
&gt; points that I've made in earlier postings, but I thought it would be
&gt; worthwhile to try to collect these points into a single reply.

&gt; &gt; WG
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I vote NO.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Comments: I don't mean to denigrate Niles' hard work, but it is 
&gt; &gt; ridiculously premature to adopt this (or anything else like 
&gt; this) as 
&gt; &gt; a base document. This document doesnt even come close to the 
&gt; &gt; requirement for a base document given in the accompanying text:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;base document: Starting point for standards words (it's 
&gt; &gt; clear the document
&gt; &gt; &gt;*can* be transformed into standards words).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It has no overall coherent ontological model; it represents 
&gt; a melange 
&gt; &gt; of conflicting and incommensurate views on many basic ontological 
&gt; &gt; issues. Its axioms have no global coherence (for example: the 
&gt; &gt; intended meaning of the quantifiers varies from one place 
&gt; to another 
&gt; &gt; in the document; later axioms do not conform to the categories 
&gt; &gt; introduced in the earlier axioms; many, if not most, of the major 
&gt; &gt; classifications depend on questionable and controversial 
&gt; philosphical 
&gt; &gt; presuppositions.) It fails to address many of the basic ontological 
&gt; &gt; issues that ned to be got clear before we can put any ontology to 
&gt; &gt; practical use (how to represent time and change, how to deal with 
&gt; &gt; alternative courses of reality, for example. ) Moreover, it 
&gt; is clear 
&gt; &gt; that the more 'pieces' are added to it, the more these problems are 
&gt; &gt; going to get worse rather than better.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This methodology is fundamentally flawed. There is no way 
&gt; to achieve 
&gt; &gt; a coherent ontology by 'merging' axioms from incommensurate 
&gt; &gt; ontological perspectives in this simplistic way. It is rather like 
&gt; &gt; trying to create  a large piece of software by just 
&gt; adjoining pieces 
&gt; &gt; of code written by different authors in different computer 
&gt; languages, 
&gt; &gt; and expecting it to magically work.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Apart from the general issues of a lack of a coherent 
&gt; methodology, I 
&gt; &gt; have many particular problems with much of the actual 
&gt; content of the 
&gt; &gt; document. As it stands, the ontology it outlines would be 
&gt; unworkable 
&gt; &gt; for me for almost any practical purpose, even if it were globally 
&gt; &gt; coherent. But this is not the right place to go into details.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that a methodology of simply adjoining concepts and 
&gt; axioms from
&gt; disparate sources would be fundamentally flawed.  However, 
&gt; this is not what
&gt; I tried to do.  I attempted to integrate the axioms/subsumption
&gt; relationships of various ontologies into the same stock of 
&gt; concepts (taken
&gt; from a simplified version of John Sowa's upper-level 
&gt; ontology).  In detail,
&gt; the procedure I used is as follows.  The first step was to 
&gt; convert all of
&gt; the ontologies listed on the SUO Candidate Content web page
&gt; (<A  HREF="http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html">http://ltsc.ieee.org/suo/refs.html</A>) into SUO-KIF.  Once this was
&gt; accomplished, I selected the most general ontology (John 
&gt; Sowa's upper level
&gt; ontology) as the base ontology.  I then mapped 
&gt; concepts/axioms from the
&gt; remaining ontologies into the base ontology.  In this mapping 
&gt; process, there
&gt; were two possible cases, each in turn with two subcases.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  New content (Nothing in the merged ontology corresponds with the
&gt; concept/axiom to be mapped)
&gt; 
&gt;   	a. Useful/Relatively Noncontroversial content.  In this 
&gt; subcase, the
&gt; new concept/axiom is deemed to 	be useful and not to 
&gt; violate any cherished
&gt; philosophical principles.  Once I decided that the new 	
&gt; concept/axiom should
&gt; be included, it was simply a matter of finding a place for it in the
&gt; ontology.  	In some cases, this required creating some intermediate
&gt; levels of concepts between existing 	concepts and new content.  These
&gt; intermediate levels were identified in an earlier email 
&gt; directed 	at
&gt; John Sowa on "trouble spots" in the merged ontology.  An 
&gt; example of this
&gt; subcase is the 	subhierarchy of numbers that was taken 
&gt; from the KIF-Numbers
&gt; ontology on the Ontolingua server. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	(subclass-of RealNumber Number)
&gt; 	(subclass-of RationalNumber RealNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of PositiveRealNumber RealNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NegativeRealNumber RealNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of Integer RationalNumber)
&gt; 	(subclass-of EvenInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of OddInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NaturalNumber Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NonnegativeInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NegativeInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of PositiveInteger Integer)
&gt; 	(subclass-of PositiveNumber Number)
&gt; 	(subclass-of NegativeNumber Number)
&gt; 	(subclass-of ComplexNumber Number) 
&gt; 
&gt; 	b. Useless/Controversial content.  In this subcase, the new
&gt; concept/axiom is judged (by me) to be 	either not useful or too
&gt; controversial for incorporation into a schema that we hope 
&gt; will have both
&gt; broad application and wide acceptance.  This is of course a 
&gt; very subjective
&gt; judgement, but ontology 	merging/alignment is probably 
&gt; much more of
&gt; an art than a science.  An example of content that was 	
&gt; thought to be too
&gt; controversial for inclusion is the following hierarchy of 
&gt; normative notions
&gt; developed by myself.  It is too controversial, because there 
&gt; are many ways
&gt; of categorizing such 	notions, and some have suggested that a 
&gt; version of
&gt; Deontic Logic would be more appropriate for 	capturing the required
&gt; connections.
&gt; 
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of Normative Entity)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Normative)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of NormativeProposition Proposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of Obligation NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of Agreement NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of JudgementOfEtiquette NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of AestheticJudgement NormativeProposition)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of InstitutionalObligation Obligation)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of PersonalObligation Obligation)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of ReligiousObligation InstitutionalObligation)
&gt; 	;; (subclass-of LegalObligation InstitutionalObligation)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Old Content (There is some degree of overlap between the 
&gt; merged ontology
&gt; and the concept/axiom to be     mapped)
&gt; 
&gt; 	a.  Perfect Overlap.  In this case, the terms may 
&gt; differ but the new
&gt; concept has the same semantic 	content as a concept 
&gt; already in the merged
&gt; ontology or, with respect to axioms, there is a logical 	
&gt; equivalence
&gt; between the new axiom and an existing axiom.  An example of 
&gt; this sort of
&gt; case occurs in 	the various mereotopological theories.  
&gt; Some philosophers
&gt; use 'part-of' as the primitive notion to 	frame their 
&gt; axioms, some use
&gt; 'overlaps', and still others use some notion of 'connection'. 
&gt;  	However, in
&gt; many cases, axioms across these different systems are 
&gt; logically equivalent.
&gt; 
&gt; 	b.  Partial Overlap.  In this case, there is some 
&gt; overlap in meaning
&gt; between the new content and 	existing concepts or axioms in 
&gt; the merged
&gt; ontology.  An example of this is the case role hierarchy.  	Although
&gt; John Sowa's system of case roles was part of the base 
&gt; ontology (and, hence,
&gt; the original 	merged ontology), I tried to simplify it 
&gt; somewhat to make it
&gt; more like other systems of case roles.  	Both systems follow:
&gt; 
&gt; 	John Sowa's Subhierarchy under 'Role':
&gt; 
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of PrehendingEntity Role)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of PrehendedEntity Role)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Composite PrehendingEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendingEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Correlative PrehendedEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Component PrehendedEntity)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Whole Composite)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Substrate Composite)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Part Component)
&gt; 	;;(subclass-of Property Component)
