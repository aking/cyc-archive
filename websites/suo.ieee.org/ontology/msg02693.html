"YAP"? Not sure about it ... I did not intend to write that any "positive"
ontology will ever come out all-armed from the process I propose. It's not
even in a corner of my mind - except maybe in some weird dreaming remote one
... So I suppose I have to go deeper in what I am really about.
I'm tracking the moves of vultures to try and find out where the corpses lie
in the desert. Or maybe I'm more interested in the vultures moves themselves
than by the stinking carrions they gather around. In the topic map community
these days, people are hypnotized by a metaphysical question: a topic is a
system representation of a subject ... but what is a subject? The approach I
am pushing here and there is that a subject is a gathering of vultures,
about a carrion that is generally so much rotten and with so many birds
around that it is no more possible to identify it. And that much of the time
you would find nothing there more than this gathering, because the first
vulture to home there was misleading or blind and the others made the
mistake to trust its indication.
So what I'm interested in is the geography of vultures gathering points. And
for that I claim we can be positive and see this geography from the sky
above. The clustering algorithms will never ever let us discover any
absolute "core concepts" and even less "core relationships" - that is "why"
the vultures are there. But maybe they will help us to target and focus on
those binding points we tacitly agree to gather around. What lies at these
points we'll not identify in a positive way, nor why those points are linked
the way they are. I fully agree that *whatever* is focusing conversation
around those points is best defined as "nor-neither". And going to
"fundamental" is always cutting off rather than putting more, I could not
agree more about that.

To build a fundamental tool for this "more and more" civilization out of a
"nor-neither" vacuity-driven approach would be a delightful paradox indeed
... But I digress ...

&gt; I think we're homing towards something pretty constructive here.
&gt;
&gt; [Philip Jackson wrote:]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To clarify, the approach I proposed is not based on topic maps.
&gt; &gt; I reprint my description of the "standard kernel ontology"
&gt; &gt; approach below, with Pat Hayes' reply to it.
&gt;
&gt; That was clear -- to me at least.  My push of topic maps in the
&gt; middle of the debate was deliberately opportunist I must confess :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I do think that work on topic maps could be useful in this approach,
&gt; &gt; in at least two ways:  1) the methods used to construct topic maps
&gt; &gt; could be helpful in identifying candidates for ontological primitives,
&gt; &gt; and for identifying how the ontology kernel could be extended to new
&gt; &gt; concepts and domains;  2) the topic map approach could be useful for
&gt; &gt; visualization of the ontology kernel and its extensions.
&gt;
&gt; I think we are tuned.  The kernel ontology I envision is like
&gt; a central conceptual attractor, which could be extracted from
&gt; a large collaborative topic map of general concepts, through
&gt; clustering procedures.  As I proposed in a previous message,
&gt; we have right now the tools to conduct such an experiment:
&gt; both collaborative on-line software to build the semantic
&gt; graph data base, and graph clustering algorithms.  These
&gt; algorithms are based on the density of graph incidence.
&gt; In short, you feed the base with thousands of topics
&gt; and local associations (n-ar relationships), without
&gt; any predefined global plan, classification nor hierarchy,
&gt; and even with contradictory or at least divergent views
&gt; of the world.  The clustering algorithms will construct
&gt; a "zoom-out" reduction of the graph, following the principle
&gt; that the most connected nodes are the most important ones.
&gt; I am very curious to see if the result will make sense or
&gt; would turn out to be some other messy representation model.
&gt; So I'm ready to open right now for a free experiment the
&gt; frame of the Semantopic Map project to any interested
&gt; collaborator.
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.universimmedia.com/semantopic.htm">http://www.universimmedia.com/semantopic.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I listed a few examples of potential conceptual / ontological / semantic
&gt; &gt; primitives.  I think these are probably a good core set to start with,
&gt; &gt; but I also think that further discussion will produce refinements and
&gt; &gt; additional candidates.
&gt;
&gt; As a matter of fact, some of the primitives you propose are already used
&gt; in the quoted project as "middle" ontology terms, that is to define role
&gt; types in associations of individuals.  For example:  event, tool, context
...
&gt; This completely bottom-up approach could meet in the same graph structure
&gt; the top-down approach of formalists.  That is the challenge.  What I
suggest
&gt; is not to discuss the validity or centrality of the concepts you push, but
to
&gt; implement them and begin to build associations around them and other
proposed
&gt; "primitives". I suppose you will have some ideas how to connect the core
concepts
&gt; you propose together and with other ones.  I look forward for you now to
come and
&gt; play in that sandbox!
&gt;
&gt; Of course, as David Whitten points out elsewhere, this would not make
&gt; for inference rules.  Not yet.  But maybe along the road we'll find
&gt; paths towards that also.

Bernard,

I think I am having a near-death experience.  Every half-baked idea
that I ever had as a kid is flashing before my eyes all over again --
when I thought that I used know just how the mind did its bit -- that
was before, of course, I ever sat down to deal with the computer and
it gave me all the rope that I needed to call my own bluff.  But now
we have systems that are designed to help us preserve our illusions --
just like the earliest of all virtual reality environments, by the
name of "Fortran", that allowed the physicists to deny for just
a little bit longer the reality of the information dimension.

What you are proposing here is all too familiar to me.  My personal pet
name for it is "yet another positivism" (YAP) -- all puns are
intentional! --
by which I mean that it is embodies the mistake of starting out with
linkages
of a positive character and failing to realize that no real logic can ever
come
of that.  Clustering, connectionism, for all Icarus, they are birds of no
feather
in this.  What you need to realize, and to comprehend the significance of,
is what
Peirce knew when he discovered the "amphecks" (from the Greek for "cutting
both ways"),
that the logical negative, in some form or other, is more generative than
the positive,
since you can get positives from joining only negatives, but no negatives
from linking
only positives.  This should tell you something very telling about what you
should pick
as logically primitive relationships.
