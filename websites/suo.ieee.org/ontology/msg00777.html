Phil,

Long time no see!

Thanks for helping me to pin down the locations
of some of the tenter-hooks that we are hung-up
and hanging-on here.

I will just interject, within your text,
the first things that come into my mind.

&gt; 
&gt; Jim, and all,
&gt; 
&gt; Once again I will jump into the fray with a few
&gt; comments and suggestions for how to proceed.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that SUO has been making progress,
&gt; yet three central issues are unresolved:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) What are the objectives for use of the SUO?
&gt; 
&gt; 2) What are the requirements for the SUO?
&gt; 
&gt; 3) What are the requirements for the language(s)
&gt;    in which the SUO will be represented?
&gt; 
&gt; Before we can decide what language to use we
&gt; need to agree on the requirements for the language.
&gt; The requirements for the language depend on the
&gt; requirements for the SUO, which depend on the
&gt; objectives for the SUO.
&gt; 
&gt; Much of the discussion in SUO seems to involve these issues
&gt; while trying to make progress on theoretical questions related
&gt; to the SUO itself.  There needs to be a consensus on these issues
&gt; before people can agree about the value of any proposed candidate
&gt; for the SUO, or any proposed elements of an SUO, though efforts
&gt; such as Ian Niles' "merged ontology" are valuable at least
&gt; as strawmen to help identify issues.
&gt; 
&gt; The objectives of the SUO are addressed briefly at the SUO website,
&gt; in sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, though questions
&gt; still arise about the objectives.
&gt; 
&gt; Likewise the requirements for the SUO are addressed briefly in
&gt; the sections on Scope and Purpose of the project, yet there
&gt; are questions that are unresolved about the requirements.
&gt; E.g. the Scope discussion says "an upper ontology is
&gt; limited to concepts that are meta, generic, abstract,
&gt; and philosophical" yet we have discussions about whether
&gt; the ontology should include "semiotic concepts" or should
&gt; only include things that "really exist" in the world.

Okay, this seems to identify one of the main sticking points
for me personally, and I have only recently been able to get
enough of a pers-pective on it to barely begin to figure out
what the matter actually is.  It seems to be a bit like this:

When I initially began participating in the various threads that have been
more or less dedicated to "Semiotics Formalization" (SF), I did not at all
realize the difference in perspective that existed between me and the rest
of the participants who were apparently quite interested in the same topic.
In its critical points, as best I can see right now, after a long spell of
extremely puzzled reflection, the difference appears to be a bit like this:

1.  One POV (that I am now guessing is the outlook of most KIF^n Cousins,
    Parolees of La Logique FOLie, and other participants in this e-agora)
    views the whole divided subject-matter of semiology/semiotics as not
    a whit more than "yet another subject matter" (YASM) for rolling up
    in the Universal Wrapper of their favorite Logic, whether the Goodies
    be candied, cyclamated, diet, filled, "lite", NP-hard-or-soft-centered,
    saccharin, sugared, or whatever variety of confection they may confect
    to be wrapped-up in their bag.

2.  One POV (mine, perhaps other Perseans, byzantine, canonical, or otherwise)
    quite literally views this semeiotic/semitotic zygote, the homunculus of
    all future sense to be borne in time, as a more general subject than logic --
    though perhaps more "primitive", more "rudimentary", more "savage" (in the
    sense of 'La Pensée Sauvage' by Claude Levi-Strauss) would be better words
    to use for its relationship to what we think "in" and "of" as Formal Logic.
    In this light, this tool, or the brand of it that I personally prefer to
    call the "pragmatic theory of signs" (PTOS) is the prior instrument, the
    precursive methodology, the proto-organon that I use in order to study
    the more evolved dynamics and the more formalized implementations of
    logic itself, in whatever "language of the month" that it may happen,
    for the moment, to find itself flavored and wrapped up in. 

Have To Break Now,

Jon Awbrey
