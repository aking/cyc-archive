Robert,

Myself, I usually call such an agent
by any one of the following names:
Interpreter (I), Observer (O),
Interpretant Observer (IO),
Observant Interpreter (OI),
at time, neologistically,
the Interrupreter.

For a pragmatician, I dare say, these are all different titles for the same job,
due to the indiscernibility between interpreting and observing one's experience.

It is a standard exercise in the Peircean theory of signs
to try one's hand at coming to grips with the relationship
between interpreters, putative agents of the interpretative
process, or as they say, of the ongoing "semiosis", and the
so-called "interpretant signs" that intervene in this action
between the object of a sign and the initial sign in question.

A big portion of my dissertation work is directed toward trying
to make sense of this relationship in a system-theoretic setting.

Here is how I discuss what I regard to be one of the most critically illuminating
passages in Peirce's entire treatment of this "interpretant-interpreter" question:

[ Acronym Glossary:
|
| IM   =  interpretive moment
| MOI  =  model of interpretation
| SOI  =  system of interpretation
]

1.3.4.18  C'est Moi

From the emblem unfurled on a tapestry to tease out the
working of its loom and spindle, a charge to bind these
frameworks together is drawn by necessity from a single
request:  "To whom is the sign addressed?"  The easy,
all too easy answer comes "To whom it may concern", but
this works more to put off the question than it acts as
a genuine response.  To say that a sign relation is
intended for the use of its interpreter, unless one has
ready an independent account of that agent's conduct,
only rephrases the initial question about the end of
interpretation.

The interpreter is an agency depicted over and above the sign relation,
but in a very real sense it is simply identical with the whole of it.
And so one is led to examine the relationship between the interpreter
and the interpretant, the element falling within the sign relation to
which the sign in actuality tends.  The catch is that the whole of the
intended sign relation is seldom known from the beginning of inquiry,
and so the aimed for interpretant is often just as unknown as the rest.

These eventualities call for the elaboration of interpretive and objective
frameworks in which not just the specious but the speculative purpose of
a sign can be contemplated, permitting extensions of the initial data,
through error and retrial, to satisfy emergent and recurring questions.

At last, even with the needed frameworks only partly shored up, I can
finally ravel up and tighten one thread of this rambling investigation.
All this time, steadily rising to answer the challenge about the identity
of the interpreter, "Who's there?", and the role of the interpretant,
"Stand and unfold yourself", has been the ready and the abiding state
of a certain system of interpretation, developing its character and
gradually evolving its meaning through a series of imputations and
extensions.  Namely, the MOI (the SOI experienced as object) can
answer for the interpreter, to whatever extent that the called for
conduct can be formalized, and the IM (the SOI experienced in act,
in statu nascendi) can serve as a proxy for the momentary thrust of
interpretive dynamics, to whatever degree that the called for process
can be explicated.

To put a finer point on this result I can do no better at this stage
of discussion than to recount the "metaphorical argument" that Peirce
persistently uses to illustrate the same conclusion.

| I think we need to reflect upon the circumstance that every word implies
| some proposition or, what is the same thing, every word, concept, symbol
| has an equivalent term -- or one which has become identified with it, --
| in short, has an 'interpretant'.
|
| Consider, what a word or symbol is;  it is a sort of representation.
| Now a representation is something which stands for something.  ...
| A thing cannot stand for something without standing 'to' something 'for'
| that something.  Now, what is this that a word stands 'to'?  Is it a person?
|
| We usually say that the word 'homme' stands to a Frenchman for 'man'.
| It would be a little more precise to say that it stands to the Frenchman's
| mind -- to his memory.  It is still more accurate to say that it addresses
| a particular remembrance or image in that memory.  And what 'image', what
| remembrance?  Plainly, the one which is the mental equivalent of the word
| 'homme' -- in short, its interpretant.  Whatever a word addresses then or
| 'stands to', is its interpretant or identified symbol.  ...
|
| The interpretant of a term, then, and that which it stands to are identical.
| Hence, since it is of the very essence of a symbol that it should stand 'to'
| something, every symbol -- every word and every 'conception' -- must have an
| interpretant -- or what is the same thing, must have information or implication.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~NOITATRESSID~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

&gt; I tried to observe before that all of semantics constitutes
&gt; an agreement among cognitive agents (e.g. two persons who agree
&gt; they are pointing at the same occurrent;  or one agent who agrees
&gt; with himself that he is looking at an instance of the same continuant
&gt; after a while, etc etc.  Is this too trivial to mention, or am I too
&gt; obtuse, in hypothesizing that we include these cognitive agents, AND
&gt; perhaps the procedure by which they arrive at their agreements, AND
&gt; the contexts that must restrict or qualify these agreements, as
&gt; first-class citizens in any ontological design process?  Or has
&gt; somebody been there &amp; done that?  I'd like a reference so I may
&gt; catch up in that case.

Myself, I have spoken of this facet of interpretation so often here
and elsewhere that it would be difficult for me to recount them all,
but here are some links that leap to mind:

<A  HREF="http://www.shss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html">http://www.shss.montclair.edu/inquiry/fall95/awbrey.html</A>
<A  HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/integrat.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/integrat.htm</A>
<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg00683.html">http://suo.ieee.org/email/msg00683.html</A>

...

&gt; ### In John's statement above, the key hidden elements
&gt; in my opinion again are these implied silent agents who
&gt; are "given assurance", allegedly "are mistaken" and have
&gt; or not "reasonable doubt".  Without the implied agreement by
&gt; them in spite of these mistakes, doubts, ... the identification
&gt; process and its result would be, in a quite formal sense, meaningless.
&gt;

Jon Awbrey
