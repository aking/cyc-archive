jim, matthew, alea ...

i'm down with a code, runing on automatic,
&amp; 3 days behind just trying to follow all
the compliants, in short, uncle!

i have to start addressing my iobox
at the other end now.

i have already moved my main line'o'goods
to the other markuplace, so maybe this is
all moot now.

matthew's plan sounded good -- i only worry about
the &quot;global brain damage&quot; that occurred last time
we surgered ourselves into pieces and lost all
the connections of internal links.  the web is
gonna fall apart, the spinner will not hold,
if people keep doing that.  so maybe just
a gentlepersons agruement to treat this
list as a place for the devel without
having to change names and demains?
we have two other lists that some
folks were all keen and screaming
to set up, and nobody has used
them for months.

jon

p.s. jim, i can see that you have your problems with this biz,
     but i really think that i am the least of them.  the big
     obstacle is that darn near nobody in the present wreaking
     group really gives a r.a. about ontology, and the way you
     keep hammering on anybody who is just aint gonna fix it.
j.a.

&gt; Matthew Jon and others,
&gt; 
&gt; MW: However, you have frequently suggested that the only sort of document
&gt;     that you find acceptable is something that purports to be a standard
&gt;     ontology, which doesn't leave those of us that think there are some
&gt;     pre-requisites anywhere much to go.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: Agreed.  My use of the term &quot;standards words&quot; is too narrow.
&gt;     In your other post you gave some examples of pre-standards words:
&gt; 
&gt; - statement of requirements
&gt; - standing documents for internal procedures
&gt; - documents providing background theory/approach taken/proposed
&gt;   for the development of a standard.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree these are all valid for documents, but not for extended threads.
&gt; We must balance volume with how directly it contributes.  Jon's postings
&gt; are too remote for his volume.   He could post papers or introduce threads,
&gt; but he should not continue the threads on this list.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MW: I see Jon's contributions as towards a future,
&gt; &gt; &gt;     rather than current document.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If this were true, he could surely show 'some' early words.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: He has shown lots of early words.
&gt;     The whole Functional Logic thread is early words.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: OK, let's take this as an example.  Let me ask some
&gt;     questions (keeping in mind I don't follow Jon's threads).
&gt;
&gt; 1. He should have started out by proposing a draft of those words,
&gt;    or writing a paper and asking for review.  I'm guessing he started
&gt;    the thread and did his ongoing exploration.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Did he wrap up his final version and present it for review and acceptance?
&gt;
&gt; 3. Does it relate to either starter document?  If so, did he
&gt;    formally propose it to them and explain how it fits?
&gt;    If not, please explain its contribution.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; JS: He is welcome to do his exploring on the Ontology list,
&gt; &gt;     but it doesn't belong on the SUO list.  If we met in person,
&gt; &gt;     he wouldn't be permitted to do about a quarter of the talking
&gt; &gt;     on these types of topics.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: This is why I suggested essentially renaming the ontolgy list
&gt;     to the development list.
&gt; 
&gt; JS: Jon, would you agree to do your work on a 'development' list if we created done?
&gt;
