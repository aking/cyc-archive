Dear John,

&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; The other day I reread Chris Swoyer's article on Properties 
&gt; in the Stanford
&gt; Encyclopedia of Philosophy
&gt; 
&gt;    (<A  HREF="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/</A>)
&gt; 
&gt; Swoyer uses the term "property" broadly to cover relations as well as
&gt; monadic relations.  I'll stick to that usage in this message 
&gt; as well, since
&gt; I think it will be useful to distinguish between ontological 
&gt; entities and
&gt; lexical entities, and I don't think the distinction has 
&gt; always been made in
&gt; this discussion so far.   I'll use "property" for the former, and
&gt; "predicate" for the lexical entity that sometimes 
&gt; corresponds, and avoid
&gt; the word "relation" altogether.
&gt; 
&gt; Reviewing all the many issues concerning properties, 
&gt; including the issue of
&gt; whether or not they exist, makes me think that perhaps 
&gt; Matthew has hit the
&gt; nail right on the head with his statement near the end of the message
&gt; quoted below:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;MW: Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
&gt; &gt;of what a relation is to me. This would easily explain how we
&gt; &gt;have been missing each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Predicates of all arities exist in a standard syntax for 
&gt; predicate logic.
&gt; This doesn't imply that properties of any order exist -- that 
&gt; depends on
&gt; your ontology.  If I've got this right, one's ontology apparently can
&gt; depend on tropes, for example, without admitting the existence of
&gt; properties except as bundles of tropes.  (I'm not saying I 
&gt; agree with this,
&gt; I'm only saying that apparently some philosophers do).
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, even supposing you believe in properties, 
&gt; whether or not
&gt; triadic properties are needed may depend on what kinds of 
&gt; individuals one
&gt; believes in.  To take one of Jon's examples, analysis seems 
&gt; to some people
&gt; to necessarily be triadic, because there is an analisand and 
&gt; at least two
&gt; analytic components.  It seems to me that this depends on a 
&gt; belief that
&gt; each analysis is a triadic or traidic+ property, and thus is 
&gt; a somewhat
&gt; circular argument.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, if you believe that each analysis is an individual
&gt; (could be process, event, occurent, or ?), then you can 
&gt; define a monadic
&gt; predicate analysis(X) which is true iff X is an instance of 
&gt; analysis.  Then,
&gt; you could believe that there is a dyadic property, analysand, and
&gt; another dyadic property analysis_component.  This seems to me to cover
&gt; Jon's example, as well as allowing for additional dyadic 
&gt; properties such as
&gt; analysis_performer, analysis_epoch, and so on.  The essential 
&gt; three-ness
&gt; arises, of course, from the understand of analysis as a 
&gt; 'taking apart', and
&gt; would be represented by axioms that say something like "X is 
&gt; an analysis
&gt; only if (1) there exists analysand of X, and (2) there exist 
&gt; at least two
&gt; analysis_components of X.  'giving' and so on could be 
&gt; treated similarly.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that the &lt;emph&gt; engineering issue &lt;/emph&gt; is 
&gt; whether dyadic
&gt; predicates can communicate an intended interpretation that is 
&gt; satisfactory
&gt; to those who believe that the real underlying property is triadic.
&gt; 

MW: No, this is a presentation issue. In databases the advantage of
being able to represent everything as binary relations is that you 
then have one structure that can represent anything, so you don't
need to change your structure.

MW: I might add that I have also found an analysis advantage, but
that is a matter of viewpoint.


Regards  
      Matthew
