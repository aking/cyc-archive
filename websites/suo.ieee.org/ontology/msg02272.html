Dear Jon,

Since you are maintaining this thread, I will try not to cause
unnecessary work.

I've taken the same route as you of not indenting my responses
this time.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  I will try to pick up on some points below.
 
JA:  I am going to put some more time in on the concrete examples,
     and clear away everything that's been said a number of times,
     leaving only the lines of inquiry that still await an answer.

MW:  So I'm afraid that is not an argument that will
     convince me on its own.  If you wish to do that
     you will have to present a specific example of
     where the information in some triadic relation
     cannot be transformed into some set of binary
     relations.  If you provide the triadic relation,
     I will provide the binary relations from which
     the triadic relation can be constructed (or not
     and admit you are right).

JA:  Just to refresh your memory,
     here are L^0 and L^1 once again:

MW:  I had overlooked (rather than ignored) this.
     Thanks for the reminder.

| Relation L^0
|
| L^0 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 0}.

MW:  I'm not quite sure what this means in English.

The relation L^0 is ("=")
the set of 3-tuples of the
form &lt;x, y, z&gt; such that (":")
x + y + z = O, 

MW: OK up to here.

as I explained in
the initial presentation, where "+"
is taken "modulo 2", or equivalently,
in the "Galois Field of Order 2", GF(2),
as "your average mathematician off the street",
our friend, Y.A. Mots, tries to palliate the beast.

MW: I'm an engineer, not a mathematician, so I have
mostly only been concerned to use maths, not understand
it.

| L^0 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:

MW:  OK even if I don't fully understand it,
     I can treat it as a relation L^0 of
     form &lt;x, y, z&gt; until I know better.

Strictly speaking, it's a relation whose instances,
occurrences, or 3-tuples are of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt;.

|    &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;

MW:  (L^0-row L^0-row1)
     (x L^0-row1 0)
     (y L^0-row1 0)
     (z L^0-row1 0)

And what is that in English?

MW: Well, it says (is intended to say) that
 - l^0-row1 is a row in L^0
 - the x position in L^0-row1 is 0
 - the y position in L^0-row1 is 0
 - the z position in L^0-row1 is 0

See, two can play this game!

MW: I play no games, I am just ignorant of almost
all the niceties of mathematics.

I will skip to points below.

|    &lt;0, 1, 1&gt;

MW:  (L^0-row L^0-row2)
     (x L^0-row2 0)
     (y L^0-row2 1)
     (z L^0-row2 1)

|    &lt;1, 0, 1&gt;

MW:  (L^0-row L^0-row3)
     (x L^0-row3 1)
     (y L^0-row3 0)
     (z L^0-row3 1)

|    &lt;1, 1, 0&gt;

MW:  (L^0-row L^0-row4)
     (x L^0-row4 1)
     (y L^0-row4 1)
     (z L^0-row4 0)

| Relation L^1
|
| L^1 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 1}.
|
| L^1 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
|
|    &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;

MW:  (L^1-row L^1-row1)
     (x L^1-row1 0)
     (y L^1-row1 0)
     (z L^1-row1 1)

|    &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;

MW:  (L^1-row L^1-row2)
     (x L^1-row2 0)
     (y L^1-row2 1)
     (z L^1-row2 0)

|    &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;

MW:  (L^1-row L^1-row3)
     (x L^1-row3 1)
     (y L^1-row3 0)
     (z L^1-row3 0)

|    &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;

MW: (L^1-row L^1-row4)
    (x L^1-row4 1)
    (y L^1-row4 1)
    (z L^1-row4 1)

---------------------------------------------------

JA:  Perhaps the difficulty in getting started on this task lies
     in knowing exactly what it would mean that "the information
     in some triadic relation [can] be transformed into some set
     of binary relations", or even just what, in operational and
     practical terms, may be incumbent on a person who is called
     for to "provide the binary relations from which the triadic
     relation can be constructed".  My sense of it tells me that
     the word "information" plays a critical role in the problem,
     but I will need to think a bit more about how to tackle the
     elicitation and the explication of its bearing on the issue.

MW:  What I mean by this is can I reconstruct the original relation
     unambiguously, e.g. could I write an SQL view that would generate
     the original relation as a view on the new set of relations.

JA:  Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
     I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
     any rational sense will come of arguing about any purported form of
     "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
     "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
     unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
     that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
     I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
     since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
     anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
     and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
     at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
     has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.

MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
     In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
     number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
     network of relations there is a path that links them together.

JA:  This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
     that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
     this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
     such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
     It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
     3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
     same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
     the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
     are many such special cases of relations, but their existence
     does not affect the general truth that many 3-adic relations
     are not of this kind.  And, once again, the logical forms of
     these very reductions involve 3-adic relations at every step
     of the corresponding analyses.

MW:  So you say.

Yes, but you did not hear it here first.
Id est, not if you ever heard of Peirce.

MW: OK, so you Peirce and some others say. It still doesn't
make it so.

JA:  For example, contemplate the 3-adic
     relation that is expressed by the rheme
     "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- then ---",
     of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt;,
     and which one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:

|                        Jack
|                       o
|                      /
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
|                      \
|                       o
|                        Jill

JA:  Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
     of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
     where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.

JA:  The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
     of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
     is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
     of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
     suggest by means of the following scheme:

|                        Jack
|                [LP1]--o
|                 /      \
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12]
|                 \      /
|                [LP2]--o
|                        Jill

JA:  In this picture, the 2-adic relations LP1, LP2, and L12
     are defined to capture forms of pairwise relations like:

     LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2nd component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
                      y is the 2nd component
                      in some ordered pair.

JA:  Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
     defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
     it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:
 
     LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP2 (q, y).
 
JA:  This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
     that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
     all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
     if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
     There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
     2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
     composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
     have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.

MW:  I'm not concerned with "decomposable" in the sense you
     state here.  I am only concerned that if there is some
     triadic relation, is there some set of dyadic relations
     that contain (at least) the same information, i.e. the
     triadic relation can be constructed as a view on the
     dyadic relations.  One might refer to such a set of
     dyadic relations as a decomposition of the triadic
     relation, but not in the sense that you use the
     word above.

Just try to remember the "Golden Rule" (GR):

| "Standardize Unto Others" (SUO) as you
| would have others standardize unto you.

The words "de/composition", "de/composable",
and their kin have been used in this way by
fairly well-established communities of folk
for many centuries of years, and so, even I,
who has been peirced through and through to
see that we also prolong the inevitable who
standardize to wait on the ultimate ambigue,
will try to respect the customs that people
did bear on their shoulders, in their heads,
all this time, and the longer, the regarder.

MW: Fine, but obviously not communities that
I belong to, which makes misunderstanding easy.

JA:  I would like to interject a note of reservation at this juncture,
     since the definition of LP12 that I gave above is not yet in the
     form that I would consider the tip-top shape for perfect clarity.
     The main thing that it lacks in its current shape is any sort of
     careful circumscriptions of the so-called "domains of definition"
     for the assorted relations that serve defined and defining roles.
     Just as a thing to think about, you might well see reason to ask:
     "What is the domain of definition for the variable q?"  But I do
     not want to get bogged down in all of that now, so let's move on.
     Still, it helps to name these domains:  so "Q", "X", "Y" will do.

JA:  Also, while I'm at it, allow me to convert my
     temporary terminology into what is more like
     the "standard-usage-onyms" where I come from.
     As a start, notice that the 2-adic relations
     LP1 and LP2 are actually functions from the
     domain of q to the domains of x and y,
     respectively.

JA:  In recognition of this fact, it is usual to give them
     functional names, commonly something like the following
     reformulations of the definitions:

      1.  Proj&lt;1&gt; : XxY -&gt; X such that Proj&lt;1&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; x.
      2.  Proj&lt;2&gt; : XxY -&gt; Y such that Proj&lt;2&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; y.

MW:  You lost me here.  This is a foreign land,
     so if there are any significant implications
     of this, you will have to spell them out for me.

This is a totally textbook tradition, the "standard undergraduate onus",
as I bore up under it, and as I laded out the boredom of it unto others.

MW: OK, I've read a bit below, so I think I know what you are refering to 
here.

JA:  And yet, once again, this entire skirmish to mop-up
     the residual bits of 2-adic structure that may be
     squeegeed out of the original 3-adic relation is
     being waged only after the general issue has
     been conceded, for we had to use the 3-adic
     relation associated with the truth-functional
     connective "and" just to express the definition
     of LP12.

MW:  I've got no idea what you are talking about.

This played off a somewhat earlier discussion where I contemplated the
replacing of Ockham's Razor with Ockham's Spatula or Ockham's Squeegee,
but some allusions admittedly have a briefer shelf-life than others.

The point is that we do not so much eliminate 3-adic relations,
as push them down into a tighter corner of their broader realm,
as we do when we analyze a 3-adic relation into a more or less
complex composition -- I believe I am speaking strictly here --
of many 2-adics relations and functions and hopefully just
a few final 3-adic relations, of the sort that we know and
love and signify as "truth-functional connectives".

MW: Assuming one accepts truth functional connectives as
triadic (if they are that's OK, but I need to get there
first).

JA:  Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L^0 and L^1
     is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
     At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
     and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
     along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.

MW:  I think I've done that now.

On jugera.

MW: Sorry, I don't understand.

JA:  What we have just now established, a little ways above,
     is that an ordered pair q is determined by this "data":
     a couple of 2-adic relations, in particular, functions,
     whose names are not of any great importance, but which
     I am now calling the "projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; amd Proj&lt;2&gt;,
     together with the values of q's projections in X and Y.

MW:  I am well and truly lost.

All I have done here is to change the names
and the forms of application of your 2-adic
"role" relations to ones that are a bit more
appropriate to what they actually are, namely,
functions from some domain to some codomain --
after all, it is in the interests of the overall
computational economy, not to mention conceptual
parsimony, to recognize a function when we see one.

MW: OK, I think I'm with you, but I am specifying the 
coordinates of a component within a relation rather than the
projection of it onto some co-ordinates. So if you like I am
making the point an object, and then saying separately what its
x, y, and z co-ordinates are.
 
JA:  Here is a sort of picture that can be useful in helping us
     to remember what is essential in this kind of a relational
     situation, beneath the vast bewildering array of notations:

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o       q   o
|   x7 o     / \ o y7
|    x6 o   /   * y6
|     x5 o /   o y5
|      x4 *   o y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.
 
MW:  Still lost.

It is just a 2-dimensional cartesian coordinate framework,
with the sleight modification of being rotated 45 degrees.
Here is a more "standard upright organization" of the bit:

|      X
|      ^
|      |
|   x7 o
|      |
|   x6 o
|      |
|   x5 o
|      |
|   x5 o
|      |
|   x4 o
|      |                          &lt;x3, y5&gt;
|   x3 o &lt;---------------------------q
|      |                             |
|   x2 o                             |
|      |                             |
|   x1 o                             |
|      |                             v
|      +-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----&gt; Y
|            y1    y2    y3    y4    y5    y6    y7

MW: OK, I'm with you now (at least about what the diagram
illustrates).

JA:  We have just illustrated the circumstance -- 
     coincidence?  I think not! -- that a deux-tuple
     is determined by the details of its projective
     pieces -- still, according to a sage bit of wisdom,
     if a deux-tuple did not exist that was determined by
     the data of its projective parts, then it should be
     necessary to invent one that was -- which is parably 
     what this bible of pan-categorics tells us about the
     genesis of every cartesian product:  [Cat Work Math].

MW: But I still don't get this.

JA:  So what if we add another character, yclept "p", let us say,
     to this little drama of relations that we have set out here?

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o   p   q   o
|   x7 o / \ / \ o y7
|    x6 *   .   * y6
|     x5 o / \ o y5
|      x4 *   * y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that p = &lt;x5, y3&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(p) = x5, Proj&lt;2&gt;(p) = y3,
| that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.

JA:  We are now looking at a non-trivial 2-adic relation,
     that is, one that has more than one 2-tuple to its name.
     Speaking of which, it has none yet, so let's give it the
     moniker "M&lt;35&gt;", mnemonically, say, for "Move 3 &lt;-&gt; 5".

JA:  Now, one of the interesting things that we can do with
     the "coordinate projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; and Proj&lt;2&gt; is to
     extend their definitions from single points or tuples
     to entire relations, comprising many points or tuples.

JA:  Definition.  For the 2-adic relation L c X x Y, and Proj&lt;j&gt;, j = 1, 2,
     the "projection of L on the j^th axis (or j^th domain)" is defined as:

     Proj&lt;j&gt;(L)  =  {Proj&lt;j&gt;(e) : e in L}.

JA:  Thus, in the present example:

     1.  Proj&lt;1&gt;(M&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;1&gt;(p), Proj&lt;1&gt;(q)}  =  {x3, x5}  c  X.
     2.  Proj&lt;2&gt;(M&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;2&gt;(p), Proj&lt;2&gt;(q)}  =  {y3, y5}  c  Y.

     Well, that was such fun that I'm tempted to try another one.

MW:  Just double Dutch to me.  I suspect I lack the
     basic mathematics you are assuming, or at least
     this way of talking about it.

Aw c'mon.  And yet you have this depth of intuition about
n-adic relations to draw on, such a reasonable facsimile
of mathematical knowledge that you can profess so much
certainty about them.  Would that I had such content!

MW: Experience rather than knowledge.

But maybe the Figures and Legends that I have revised,
each helping to enlighten the other, may do the trick?

MW: Yes I think you have given me enough clues, for most of it anyway.

JA:  Let us then contemplate another non-trivial 2-adic relation:

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o   r   o
|      o   / \   o
|     o   /   \   o
|   x7 o /     \ o y7
|    x6 *   s   * y6
|     x5 o / \ o y5
|      x4 *   * y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that r = &lt;x5, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(r) = x5, Proj&lt;2&gt;(r) = y5,
| that s = &lt;x3, y3&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(s) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(s) = y3.

JA:  Let us dub this one as "L&lt;35&gt;", say, on the basis
     of a likely graphical analogy, for "Loop 3 and 5".

JA:  Computing the projections for this example:

     1.  Proj&lt;1&gt;(L&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;1&gt;(r), Proj&lt;1&gt;(s)}  =  {x3, x5}  c  X.
     2.  Proj&lt;2&gt;(L&lt;35&gt;)  =  {Proj&lt;2&gt;(r), Proj&lt;2&gt;(s)}  =  {y3, y5}  c  Y.

JA:  Thus this renders it beyond the shadow of a doubt,
     if it was not already evident from their mugshots,
     that L&lt;35&gt; &amp; M&lt;35&gt; have the very same projections.

JA:  So, what have we learned from this state of affairs?
     Just that, even though single tuples are determined
     by their projection data, that relations themselves,
     generally speaking, are not.

JA:  I think that this is something to think about.

MW:  But first I need to understand what you are saying.

Let me know if the new elaborations and explanations help any.

MW: I'm getting there, but I suspect I am still missing the 
point.

MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
     for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
     that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
     then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
     statement about how I see relations.

MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
     They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
     infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
     combinations of things, and then I see a further
     infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
     ourselves to those where all the members of the
     set have the same adacity).

MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of them,
     but to a very small subset we choose (note the word choose)
     to map our experiences of the world to in terms of connections
     (broad sense) that we see between things.

MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the world
     and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how to do it).
     I'm not sure you share that view.

MW:  I would suggest that we talked more about what was being 
     represented rather than how it was being represented.
     I suspect that we would then find more to agree about.

JA:  I am afraid that we can only talk about things
     in so far as we represent them.

MW:  So I can only talk about an activity as a relation
     if that is how I represent it?  I don't think so.

Huh?  'When' you talk about an activity 'as' a relation,
that is to say, as you have just said, 'qua' a relation,
then you are, ipso facto, representing it as a relation.

MW: Correct, my slopiness.

One of us has to listen when you speak -- I know, it's
a dirty job and all that ...

At any rate, since I 'was' listening to what I said,
as I was talking to myself when I wrote that to you,
I know that I said 'in so far as', which leaves the
'qua' of the 'as' as an open variable, TBA, later.

Thus it is implicit in the reading, and it is commonly understood --
you do not have to take the author's word for his intent, I guess,
but if you query your average population of anglophone informants
I think that it will turn out to be as I say -- that the sentence:

| I am afraid that we can only talk about things
| in so far as we represent them.

is understood as:

| I am afraid that we can only talk about things
| in so far as we represent them (in some way).

The bit about representing "activity 'as' relation"
was thy ipse dixit, not mine.  That is, of course,
a very apt suggestion, but it is only one option
among many, and it was up to you to choose it.

MW: Oh good. I hadn't had this so clearly from you. So there
are multiple possible represenations of things like activities
annd some might be tuples and some might not be, any of which
may be useful for some purpose.

MW: To hear you "talk" I had gained the impression that you
considered that some things could only possibly be represented
by triadic relations.

JA:  As an object example, taken for the moment in
     the converse direction of synthesis, joining
     an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already
     an element of a 3-adic relation, just as every
     other "binary operation" is a 3-adic relation.

MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.
     Binary operations are of the form F : a -&gt; b,
     and even though a and b might be quite complex,
     the essential form is binary.

JA:  I would say that the accidental form, even the 
     superficial form is binary -- anything at all
     can be glossed over with a superficially simple
     appearance -- it is our job precisely to detect
     and to reveal the underlying complexities.

MW:  Interesting.  I prefer to reveal the underlying simplicity.

Speaking of Double Dutch:

I will nominate you for the Ronnie Raygun Prize in Economics.

MW: Missed (too subtle for me).


JA:  Here, let me try to explain it to you this way.
     The following table presents the 3-adic relation
     that is otherwise known as the 2-ary operation of
     conjunction, commonly symbolized by "and" or "&amp;":

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  Now, let us suppose that you are a humble Data Scrivener,
     as I once was, and your not-so-humble Boss comes to your
     cubicle one day, no doubt pursuant to that data downsize
     directive that I encouraged you to explore in a previous
     scenario, and tells you that you need to get this simple
     structure into a 2-column table at most, which being the
     true believer in economy that you are you promptly do as
     follows:

o-----------o---------o
|&lt; x  ,  y &gt;| z = x&amp;y |
o-----------o---------o
|&lt; 0  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 0  ,  1 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  1 &gt;|    1    |
o-----------o---------o

JA:  Whereupon you are promptly rewarded with a well-deserved
     promotion at twice your former salary for the incredible
     shrinking cost you have thereby beneficed your unit with!

JA:  In yer dreams ...

MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
     We are talking about representation of things, rather
     than what things are.

JA:  The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated 
     knowledge of being, is not a day I think that any of
     our sort will see this side of heaven.  The only way that
     we "fallible and mortal finite information creatures" have to
     approach the One and the Universal is via the Many Appearances,
     by taking up as many different styles and types of representations
     as we can fathom, and then, by way of transformations on them, to
     distill what invariants, half concealing and half disclosing,
     they may manifest.

MW: So it is innapropriate to discuss whether an activity is (or is not)
a spatio-temporal extent? (Not everything is about representation).

MW:  If we set the representation by relations of particular adacity
     aside, I think we would find much more to agree about.

JA:  Well, that is a heavenly notion.

But, alas, I must tarry here below.
I still have so much to do, y'know.
 
JA:  The only residual dross of the matter
     appears to turn on the circumstance that
     some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
     from an element of one.

MW:  But there is no difference, except in perspective.

The parallax between heaven, earth, and elsewhere
is nothing to squint at for a motely embodied eye.
 
MW:  OK well let me first try to state a method,
     you will have to forgive some lack of formality,
     but it should not be so unclear what I mean.

MW:  Where I come from this method would be
     informally known as reification.

JA:  Gasp!

JA:  I do not know why I was so astonished by this usage
     that I could not even comment on it for several days.
     I have certainly seen enough "cargo cultism" here and
     there in my time -- and web culture seems to be utterly
     drenched in it -- to know that new rites for old spells
     are constanly burbling up all the time, and it appears
     that the furthest thought from the minds of the sort
     of flock who are busily compillaging our brave new
     wörterbücher would be to cast their whatevery eyes
     upon the decks of those rapedly obsolescing brands.
     And so it should not shock me too much that old words
     are getting new twists, often to the point of torture,
     day by day -- and who knows, it may be that I, too, have
     inadvertently been responsible for a turn or two, myself,
     but then I remind myself that the word that has been turned,
     by degrees, to the point where it now bears a sense 180 about
     from the sense that it onetime had, well, if things keep going
     on this way, then one day that word may come to be revolved 360,
     and thus have its leaning restored to its once and future meaning.

JA:  At any rate, when I was I child, we called this "codification",
     but now that I am no longer a child I know it as "sublimation".

JA:  I am collating the various versions of your methodology below,
     and I am also altering the notation slightly to avoid clashes.

In the effort to arrive at a coherent account between the two of us,
I will incrementally edit the entire discussion below, marking my
changes to your text with square brackets the first time or two
that I make them, then letting them pass unmarked after that,
so keep an eye out for these flags to check whether I have
got the current intent and sense of things right.  Okay?

MW: Yes, I will try to help rather than make it difficult.

Nota Bene.  This is called a "unification algorithm".
It proceeds by incrementally "weeding out the joint"
data structure that is known as a "disagreement set".
But do not worry, nobody says that we have to inhale.

MW:  Purpose:

V1:  To take any n-adic relation occurrence
     and turn it into n binary relations
     without loss of meaning.

V2:  To take what is represented by an n-ary relation,
     and represent it by n binary relations and
     a set/class of objects.

JA:  I am taking the sense of your later explanations to be
     that "n-adic relation occurrence" is just an "n-tuple",
     otherwise known as an "n-adic relation instance".

MW:  Yes.

JA:  Of course, it would only be interesting if an entire n-adic relation,
     not just a single n-tuple, was being converted into 2-adic relations,
     right?

MW:  Of course.

MW:  Method:

V1:  Create an object (say e) that stands for
     the n-adic relation instance as a whole.

V1:  e replaces the tuple rather than a relation.
     So e replaces &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;.

V1:  This does not mean that e = &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;.
     There is a relationship, but it is one of derivability
     rather than equality.

I still do not get this bit about "derivability, not equality".

MW: There is something in a later e-mail that relates to this. it
is really that the relationship between the two is that they represent
the same thing, rather than actually are themselves (a constant and a tuple)
the same thing.

V1:  Take each each [component] in the relation occurrence --
     the relation occurrence is a tuple, [a component] is the thing
     in a place in a tuple, so &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt; --
     and create a relation between it and e.
 
V2:  For each tuple 

      &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;

     that is a member of the n-ary relation (L) create exactly
     one object (e) that is a member of the set of objects (E).

JA:  Just for the sake of concreteness as I attempt to follow along,
     let me try this method out on one or two of the above examples.

JA:  Relation L(&amp;) = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x &amp; y = z}.

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  So, for each tuple &lt;x, y, z&gt; in L(&amp;)
     create exactly one object e in set E.

     E  =  {e&lt;0&gt;, e&lt;1&gt;, e&lt;2&gt;, e&lt;3}.

JA:  Why don't we get really clever and
     use a binary index for the e's?

     E  =  {e&lt;00&gt;, e&lt;01&gt;, e&lt;10&gt;, e&lt;11&gt;}.

MW:  For each component of the tuple create a binary tuple
     that is a member of a relation that indicates the place
     in the original tuple that the component stands in, e.g.:

     place1 &lt;e, component1&gt;

JA:  I will revert to my custom here and employ the
     standard-use-onyms of "coordinate projections".

     Proj&lt;1&gt;(e) = x.
     Proj&lt;2&gt;(e) = y.
     Proj&lt;3&gt;(e) = z.

MW:  You lost me again.

Alright, the application of the 2-adic relation
that you are denoting by means of the expression,

"place1 &lt;e, component1&gt;",

is the same thing "for all practical purposes" (FAPP)
as the application of the "1st coordinate projection"
that I'm denoting by means of the following equation,
between the applied function and its specified value:

"Proj&lt;1&gt;(e) = component1".

More abstractly, that is, abstracting from these
particular applications, the 2-adic relation that
you name "place1", supposing it to be a subset of
a cartesian product, in this case, place1 c E x X,
is in fact the special brand of a 2-adic relation
that is commonly called a "function", in particular,
being "functional" from "domain" E to "codomain" X.
People -- people who speak loosely for just about
as long as they can get away with it -- often take
the liberty of using the very same name under the
variant type, writing, say, "place1 : E -&gt; X".
We, however, are past the point, or not yet to
the point, of being able to get away with this.

MW: OK I follow this (not quite the same as 
understand).

I am just plain worn out at this point,
and will have to break away for a time.

MW:  e.g. if I have:

     (gives1 John Mary Book1)

MW:  If I apply the above method I might get:

     (gives2 e)
     (giver-in John e)
     (receiver-in Mary e)
     (given-in Book1 e)

JA:  To be honest, I worry a little about this rendition,
     but I shall render under unto KIFer what is KIFer's.
     As it stands, I do not know what it's trying to say.
     Is there supposed to be some sort of equivalence?
     I do not see that "(gives2 e)" is at all simpler.
     I have trouble understanding how the materials that
     you have assembled here are supposed to do anything
     at all but restate an application of the relation
     in a different font, as it were.

MW:  simpler is only that what was ternary is now binary.
     You have also recognised the giving event/activity explicitly
     as an object, which many (including myself) would consider an
     improved representation of what is happening.

MW:  Use the role that the element plays
     in the original relation to name
     this binary relation.

| Example:
|
| (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary Book1)
|      (and (gives x)
|           (giver John)
|           (receiver Mary)
|           (given book1)
|      )
