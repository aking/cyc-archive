Dear Matthew, 
	.		Thanks for this.  

	.	Sorry for being ignorant, but it goes over my head in
places, so I have made some further comments and questions interspersed
below, prefaced  "GH&gt;	".

Dear Colleagues,

I have put various bits of where I currently stand in various threads over
the last year. I have found on a number of occasions that this position has
been misunderstood by at least some. So I thought I would try to set down
some of these matters in one place, so that you can disagree with what I
really think, rather than what you imagine I think.

MOTIVATION

In the end, any view of the world is just that, a view of the world. Some
may be more accurate, or more useful for some purpose. But then you had
better understand the purpose you have in mind.

For more than 10 years I have been looking at how you can create a model
that can integrate other models of differing viewpoints and purposes. This
is slightly different from incorporating different view points in an
encyclopaedic sense, it means more being able to map any other view point
into or out of the integrating view point you are developing. 

OK so that may be asking a lot, but one of the things I have learnt is that
the easiest way not to achieve something is to be limited by your ambition,
so failure against that ambition by some margin would still be pretty good.

Of course implicit in this is that I am quite happy that there are other
viewpoints, each of which may be more or less useful for particular
purposes. I am interested in understanding these so that I can check whether
the viewpoint I am trying to develop can support a round trip mapping to and
from that viewpoint. 

You can of course incorporate all the viewpoints and the mappings into an
encyclopaedic ontology. Whether you choose to do this is a structuring
rather than conceptual issue. 

What follows is an overview of key elements of that viewpoint (for which I
claim no originality) and some issues of how that can be represented within
the KIF language.

EXTENSIONALIST

If you want to put a label on me, then I think extensionalist is probably
your best bet. What I mean by this is taking as an identity criteria for
things, that any two things with the same extension are the same thing. (It
might be more proper to say that there are not two (or more) things with the
same extension).

The world then divides neatly into two basic sorts, sets (including
relations) and individuals (or particulars if you prefer) where individuals
are things that have an extension in space time, and sets are things that
have members. 

GH&gt;	Am not sure that this is a precise statement. Do you possibly mean
that sets are really the generic aspects of a group of things, and that that
is what can be analysed in considering a set, rather than any specific
attributes of individual members of the set? (This question based on some of
the early parts of John Sowa's Mathematical Background, and makes an
enormous difference to how I can interpret what follows. 

One thing to note about this position is that any piece of space time is an
individual, just as any collection of things is a set. That is different
again from having to be interested in all of them.

The extension of individuals being in space time give rise to the 4D label.

It follows that some important ways in which things stand to one another are
set membership and whole part.

A key thing to note is that this extensional approach automatically takes
care of change over time, using states as the backbone of how this is
managed. Competent and comprehensive accounting for change is a critical
component of any ontology that is going to cope with a changing world.

POSSIBLE WORLDS

One of the key challenges for any viewpoint is how to model what could be
(past present and future), as well as what is/has been. This is done using a
"possible worlds" approach, or more properly possible universes, in which
spatio-temporal parts can be shared between different possible universes. So
my life up to today can be part of any possible future I might have. 

GH&gt;	For analytical purposes, I would also suggest there is usefulness in
"could have been" situations, where it is postulated a difference occurred
at one or more past points in space-time. 

A consequence of this (I believe) is that modal logic is not required.

REPRESENTATION

KIF is a language, so is EXPRESS. Languages inevitably have capabilities and
limitations. 

GH&gt;	My gut feel is that you are here distinguishing between ideal and
real languages. 

A viewpoint can be mapped onto the constructs of a language, in more than
one way. It then becomes important to consider how you intend to undertake
the mapping. There are advantages in doing so in a consistent manner, and in
being aware of what it is you are doing.

So, if I have it correct (I would appreciate correction if I am not) the key
constructs in KIF are:
 - constants
 - variables (and more generally lambda calculus)
 - predication
 - relation
 - some basic elements of logic

GH&gt;	It sure would help to have succinct plain-English descriptions /
definitions of each of these terms. 

The question is how do you choose to use these. The only thing that is
certain is that if you are not consistent you will store up trouble for
yourself. 

GH&gt;	Agreed absolutely. 

The choices I make are:

o  classes and individuals map to constants
    note: remember that activities like giving are individuals
o  predication is used for set membership.
    note: in an extensional world you do not 
    need non-extensional classes
o  how one individual stands to another is modelled by 
    relation instances
    note: only binary relations are used. This is principally
    to minimise structural constraints where all places in a 
    relation must be filled, when some are not known.
    note: see below for relations between classes.
o  lambda calculus is used for defining constraints. 
    In general these indicate how a member of one class 
    must stand in respect to a member of another class.
    note: relations between classes (e.g. subclass-of) are
    only allowed when the nature of the constraint they
    define is defined by a lambda expression.

Of course I do not claim other choices for other reasons could not be made.

Actually, everything else flows from these relatively simple start points
and rationale. 

GH&gt;	sounds like a good basic structure.

      Matthew
