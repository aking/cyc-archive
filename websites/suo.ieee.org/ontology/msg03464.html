Matthew,

What do you mean by a &quot;discussion document&quot;?

Jon

JA = Jon Awbrey
JS = Jim Schoening
MW = Matthew West

JA: I am prepared to argue that my present lines of &gt; contribution have
    more pertinence to the Scope &amp; Purpose of the SUO Working Group,
    a higher quality overall, and a better rationale on many points
    than various parallels in the current Starter Documents.

JS: 'Pertinence to the Scope and Purpose' is not good enough.
     We could spend eternity on things that meet this criteria.
     We are chartered to develop a standards document, not advance
     the field of upper ontologies.

MW: True.  However, a useful standard is desirable, and discussing what
    would help to make a standard more useful is I believe relevant.

JS: Your 1000+ (I'm guessing) postings have not contributed much of any standards words.

MW: True, but much of it does address my point above.  The real issue is
    I suggest the manner of the contribution and in particular the noise
    ratio -- though that has improved significantly over recent months.

JS: You have stated your dislike for both started documents, but have not offered much of
    any specific help in improving them.  In standards development, criticisms without
    suggested improvements are of little value.  Also, the fact that you don't like
    what this group is working on does not give you the right to set your own
    agenda (i.e. conduct research) and eat up bandwidth with it.  And the
    fact that don't think the group can succeed without your research work
    does not give you the right to.

MW: Well I think Jon's comments are an elaboration on
    &quot;If I were going to Dublin, I wouldn't start from here&quot;.
    However, he is trying to point to some place where he
    thinks you should start from.

JS: If you believe the group cannot succeed without your research, there
    is a proper way to submit your work.

MW: Well as Jon has said, what he is talking about is not research
    in the &quot;novel&quot; sense of hte word, more a bringing together of
    strands from a range of disciplines.

JS: You should either submit your own starter document,
    or submit comments to the other starter documents.

MW: I agree that submitting one or a number of discussion documents --
    say 5 pages each -- would help (note discussion rather than standards).

JS: But it is not acceptable to conduct this research
    in this forum without any relationship to the work
    of this group.  Again, it is not enough that it
    relates to the Scope and Purpose.

MW: Well here I think you are wide of the mark.
    I think that Jon has a valuable contribution
    to make. I don't deny that there are issues in
    the manner of it though.

JA: You do not seem to get the fact that I am doing my level best
    to accord you the professional service of telling you exactly
    how these prospective standards will be judged by the academic,
    professional, and user communities with which I am very familiar.
    I simply think that it is better that the Group should hear about
    it now, while there is still time to fix it, rather than waiting
    to be roundly ridiculed by the first elect body of external experts
    to which these inept pretensions of expertise present themselves.
    Hear me now, and believe me later, as I think the line goes.

JS: Standards groups start with a document and improve it.

MW: No they don't, or at least not where I come from.
    For exmaple, in developing ISO18876 we spent 3 years
    making sure we understood what we were doing before we
    started developing the standard itself, in response
    to a requirement set that initiated the work.

JS: It helps little to just criticize it.  You should help to improve
    one or both documents.  If you don't think either are worth your input,
    you should either submit your own starter document, listen quietly, or leave.
    You should not eat up bandwidth with your research.

MW: Well bandwidth is a problem, but otherwise I disagree.  Jon is trying
    to make a positive contribution, but he is not being very successful
    because of the manner of the contribution, even given that he has
    improved significantly of late (IMHO).

JA: I request that you present reasoned arguments for your so far completely
    bald objections to the pertinence, the quality, and the rationality of
    my current contributions, or else cease to assert them.

JS: I don't question the quality or rationality of your postings.
    I have explained why they are pertinent.

JA: With respect to procedural issues, the role of research, a reasonable timeline
    for the project, and many other issues of that nature, my positions are quite
    the same as more seasoned members of this group.

JS: The charter rules, which is to develop a standards document,
    not advance the field of ontology.  If certain members don't
    think this is achievable, they are free to not participate,
    but they can't change the charter to focus on research.

MW: This is misrepresenting what Jon is doing.  He is not creating new stuff,
    he is presenting the existing stuff that is (or should be) relevant.
    Even I have got that far.

JS: If members want to do research, I've a couple times offered to help set up
    an IEEE task force, which could become an 'IEEE Technical Committee'.
    Nobody showed interest.

MW: I don't think more than one show would really help.

JA: In these regards, I request that you quit picking on me --
    just because you can -- and start picking on somebody
    your own size.

JS: You are receiving more guidance than others because you post far more
    messages than anyone else.  If you were to drop back to a much lower
    number, nobody would complain.

MW: This is a fair point, and I do think that Jon should strive for further
    improvement in how he makes his contribution, noting that he has already
    shown that he can improve his contribution.

JS: Others do post the same types of research postings as you, but small enough
    quantities that don't cause a problem.  But I have sent guidance to others,
    and most of them follow it, while you do not cooperate.

MW: I have been trying to point out in this note where I think you are wrong
    in your criticisms of Jon.  You have been deeming the content of his
    contributions innappropriate.  You are probably wrong here.  And he
    has moved to comply (e.g. by stating specifically how it related
    to scope and purpose) which was not what you expected, because
    you were (IMHO) attacking the wrong problem.  It is the manner
    of Jon's contribution that would bear improvement.

JS: This is why I am pushing this so hard with you.

JS: Please respond to my points, but please don't twist my words.
