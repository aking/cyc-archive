Chris,

I'm somewhat embarrassed at not replying sooner, but I seem to have a lot
of distractions and couldn't get to this sooner.  Since part of the reply
is something of an apology, I decided to reply even though a lot of time
has passed.

On about Mar 26 you wrote:

&gt;Hi John, thanks for your comments and suggestions.

&gt;&gt; 1. Reference numbers, and KIF global syntax.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It appears that there is a global syntax convention that (discussion
&gt;&gt; "xxx") preceeds the actual axiom, theorem, or definition that is being
&gt;&gt; discussed.  Can we count on this?  (If this is docmumented, I missed
&gt;&gt; it.)
&gt;
&gt;It isn't documented.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If so, this might be a good place to start putting in reference
&gt;&gt; identifiers of some kind.  Of course, putting reference identifiers on
&gt;&gt; material that is in an early stage of development has a lot of
&gt;&gt; problems, but it certainly would facilitate discussion.
&gt;
&gt;I completely agree.  In fact, some sort of reference scheme is essential
&gt;if documentation statements are to be included as object language
&gt;statements in KIF, because it is currently just an artifact of the
&gt;"source code" that documentation statements are placed immediately prior
&gt;to the axioms they document.  Logically, there is no order to things in
&gt;an ontology -- it's just a set of sentences, so there needs to be a more
&gt;robust mechanism for attaching documentation to axioms, theorems, and
&gt;definitions.  Moreover, a reference scheme shouldn't imply any
&gt;particular sequential order for the axioms, as we would have to
&gt;renumber every time we inserted an axiom somewhere.  Hence, I'm inclined
&gt;(following Pat Hayes) toward developing some sort of "wrapper" for
&gt;ontology axioms (definitions, theorems) that encloses both the axiom and
&gt;its documentation and which avoids numerical references (or at least,
&gt;avoids using them in any way that implies any sequential ordering of the
&gt;elements of the ontology), e.g.:
&gt;
&gt;{
&gt;REFNAME: sequence-extensionality
&gt;STATEMENT-TYPE: axiom
&gt;DOCUMENTATION: "Sequences are extensional, i.e., sequences with the same
&gt;elements in the same order are identical."
&gt;CONTENT:
&gt;
&gt;(forall (?seq1 ?seq2 (sequence ?seq1) (sequence ?seq2))
&gt;        (=&gt; (forall (?n ?x)
&gt;                    (&lt;=&gt; (?seq1 ?n ?x) (?seq2 ?n ?x)))
&gt;            (= ?seq1 ?seq2)))
&gt;}
&gt;
&gt;Or something like that.
&gt;

I like this.  It should be easy to parse, and put's all the information in
a nice package.  I agree with John Sowa that adding a list of the terms
used in the KIF statement is neither necessary or desirable.  On the other
hand, the suggestion that a reference to modules used or terms imported
from other modules (in a modular ontology, of course) would be useful (as I
think Mathew West advised).


&gt;&gt; 3. Some confusion results from the order in which things are
&gt;&gt; presented, and lack of clear statements as to what is primative.
&gt;&gt; Some things that are stated as axioms or theorems seem to either be or
&gt;&gt; need definitions.
&gt;
&gt;I used "definition" when a term was axiomatized with a biconditional,
&gt;and hence theoretically dispensable, but was not consistent on this
&gt;point, as I was more concerned with the content than the documentation.
&gt;(As you note, I didn't call the axiom for "unary" a definition, for
&gt;instance.)  However, theoretically, definitions are just a type of
&gt;axiom, so marking something as a definition rather than an axiom is
&gt;mostly just for heuristic value.  Again, the "documentation" mechanism
&gt;needs to be pretty thoroughly revamped in any case.
&gt;

For my taste, the heuristic is of great value.  I also think it would be of
great value to document, somehow, the terms that don't ever appear alone
"on one side" of a biconditional (primatives).

As with the "definitions" this information could be extracted by an ontology
analyser.  Nevertheless, I think this documentation, together with a brief
informal text explaining the intended meaning of the term would be valuable in
identifying the intentions of the ontology writer, and in understanding how
to build mappings between the ontology and a domain of application.

&gt;&gt; The theorem on unions of classes struck me as lacking a definition of
&gt;&gt; union -- but I found it later on.   I'm still looking for the
&gt;&gt; definition of 'empty.'
&gt;
&gt;I called it an axiom, but, to be consistent, should have called it a
&gt;definition.  I also realize that I've been using "null" to mean both the
&gt;null class and to mean "empty" in a couple of emails with Robert
&gt;Meersman, which has no doubt left him and others confused.  Here's the
&gt;axiom ("definition") for "empty":
&gt;
&gt;(forall (?rel (relation ?rel))
&gt;        (&lt;=&gt; (empty ?rel)
&gt;             (not (exists (@args) (?rel @args)))))
&gt;

OK at first glance, but I'm not sure I really understand this.  @args
represents any arbitrary (possibly empty) list (row?) of variables or constants,
as I understand (or misunderstand) it.  Now suppose I introduce a term
"foo"   and the axioms
(foo),
(relation foo), and
(forall (?x @args) (not (foo ?x @args))).

then the empty list @args satisfies
(foo @args).  So foo is not empty.  I'm not saying this is wrong, by the
way, I'm just looking at bounding cases to see what happens.
On the other hand, this seems strange, so maybe I haven't got it right yet.


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4. There is a level of abstraction (or something!) here that I had
&gt;&gt; trouble with---not wrong, just confusing to the unwary.  Like Matthew,
&gt;&gt; I was stopped for a good long time over (class relation).
&gt;
&gt;It is not really a matter of abstraction.  I think that what is probably
&gt;unfamiliar to some folks here is that you can talk about anything,
&gt;including classes, in KIF.  In particular:  relations are classes, hence
&gt;(instance-of relation class), which, given than classes are properties,
&gt;is equivalent to (class relation).
&gt;

I hope I'm starting to catch on.

&gt;&gt; 5. Well, to help sort out whether or not I'm on the right track, here
&gt;&gt; is a paraphrase of some of the content.  Any corrections or objections
&gt;&gt; will be appreciated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'll try to do some KIF, but ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  Primatives
&gt;&gt; ;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  The language includes (in addition to the bare KIF syntax)
&gt;&gt; ;;  logical connectives, and the following primatives:
&gt;&gt; ;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  relation
&gt;&gt; ;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  instance-of
&gt;&gt; ;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  particular
&gt;&gt; ;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  -- I've thrown in the term 'particular' since particulars seem to be
&gt;&gt; ;;  lurking
&gt;&gt; ;;  in the background.  I'm not sure this is essential at this stage, but
&gt;&gt; ;;  I'm more comfortable including them.
&gt;&gt; ;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  Well formed expressions --
&gt;
&gt;This is made explicit in a BNF.  Since the current KIF BNF is in flux at
&gt;the moment as it is being worked on, I didn't include one.
&gt;

I'm looking forward to it.

&gt;&gt; ;; We need to know that if (relation ?rel) then (?rel @args) is well
&gt;&gt; ;; formed if and only if @args has one or more entries.
&gt;
&gt;"@args" is just a variable.  It doesn't have "entries".  (TERM @FOO) is
&gt;always well formed, for any term TERM and any row variable @FOO.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; (documentation "Axiom: only relations can be truly predicated of other
&gt;&gt; things")
&gt;&gt; (forall (?r @args)
&gt;&gt;      (=&gt; (?r @args)
&gt;&gt;          (relation ?r)))
&gt;
&gt;You saw this in the ontology, right?
&gt;

Yes, and this is where the apology comes in.  I meant to say I'd take it
from the ontology, and was simply showing how I it would follow (in my
supposedly preferred order) the insertions I had made.

&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  instance-of is an instance of relation")
&gt;&gt; (instance-of instance-of relation)
&gt;
&gt;This is already theorem of the ontology.  We can prove, e.g.,
&gt;(instance-of null top).  Hence, by the preceding axiom, we have
&gt;(relation instance-of), and by the axiom for instance-of we have
&gt;(instance-of instance-of relation).
&gt;

OK.
&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  particular is an instance of relation")
&gt;&gt; (instance-of particular relation)
&gt;
&gt;Will be a theorem if you can derive an instance of (particular FOO).
&gt;

I agree.
&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  relation is an instance of  relation")
&gt;&gt; (instance-of relation relation)
&gt;
&gt;This is a theorem.

I agree.  (I think!)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Everything is either a relation or a particular")
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (forall (?x) (or ((relation ?x) (particular ?x))
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM:  Nothing is both a relation and a particular")
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (forall (?x) (not
&gt;&gt;                (and (relation ?x)  (particular ?x))))
&gt;
&gt;Sounds reasonable.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
&gt;&gt; ;;  It is unclear to me why unary and binary were given as AXIOMS rather
&gt;&gt; ;;  than as DEFINITIONS.   It seems to me they should be defined.
&gt;&gt; ;;  Alternatively, one makes these primative terms, and then gives
&gt;AXIOMS.
&gt;&gt; ;;  BUt why not just define them?
&gt;
&gt;Again, a definition is an axiom of a certain sort.  But you are right
&gt;that, had I been consistent, I would have marked these as definitions.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ;;  In either case, at this point in the development we can
&gt;&gt; ;;  go from here to a definiton (or axiomatization?) of arity of
&gt;relations,
&gt;
&gt;That's already been done; not sure what you are suggesting.
&gt;

More apology.  I thought I was using a collective "we", (and thus taking
partial credit for work already done :-)  )  Again, I only meant to suggest a
different order of presentation.

&gt;&gt; ;;  and the other definitions and theorems in the section on BASIC
&gt;RELATION
&gt;&gt; ;;  THEORY  (except, of course, those that refer to classes).
&gt;&gt; ;;
&gt;&gt; ;;   I think the following are axioms:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM  relation is a unary relation")
&gt;&gt; (unary relation)
&gt;
&gt;This already follows from (class relation) and the axiom that sez that
&gt;classes are unary.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM  particular is a unary relation")
&gt;&gt; (unary particular)
&gt;
&gt;Will also follow from (class particular).
&gt;

yep.
&gt;&gt; (documentation "AXIOM instance-of is a binary relation")
&gt;
&gt;This already follows from the axiom (signature instance-of top class).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now the material on classes is largely covered by the material on
&gt;&gt; relations.
&gt;
&gt;I believe it already was.

Blush.  See above apology.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope I'm on more or less the right track.
&gt;
&gt;Looks good to me.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I heartily recommend trying to write some KIF as an aid to
&gt;&gt; learning the language.
&gt;
&gt;Good advice!
