Jon,

.
JA: &gt; But I would like to ask that you not single me out if you
&gt; are not prepared to defend the same points against everyone.

JS:  You are incorrectly assuming I haven't written to anyone else with
these same points.  I have, privately, and most have agreed to my
suggestions.  The difference with you is that you take it personal, make
a big deal about it in public, dispute it, and ignore it.  

JS:         Also, the reason you are getting the most attention is you
post the most messages of this nature (I won't use the word research and
more).  If you cut your quantity of postings way down, nobody would care.
 That is one solution, but I'd rather see you relate (directly) your work
to the work of this group, if that is possible. 

JA: &gt; This tactic of saying &quot;pick a document, any document&quot; and
&gt; let's push some standard words around on paper so we'll
&gt; look official does not seem to be a line that anybody
&gt; else buys.  

JS: Good spin but hollow point.  We are chartered to try to develop a
document.   You're going to need to find a way to help with developing
such a document or won't be permitted to post so much. 

JA: I get the sense that this compulsion goes
&gt; back to a sense of a proper timeline for the project.
&gt; If you are on the 2 year plan and others are on the
&gt; 10 year plan, then it is inevitable that there will
&gt; be some friction about what we should be doing at
&gt; this point in time.  Since I am scarcely alone in
&gt; taking the long view, I believe that this issue
&gt; is already one that belongs on the main floor.

JS; Honestly, I think it could easily take 10 years.  IEEE give us 4
years to start, 1 of which is already gone.  But they give another 2
years without question and more years if the end is in sight.  Plus you
can always just submit a new PAR, so the bottom line is IEEE's time
limits aren't real, but they give a little incentive and can be used to
shut down projects that aren't making progress.   I feel we should shoot
for 3 years from now, but be prepared for a long haul.  But my point has
been that your nature of posting will never get us anywhere if they don't
result in standards words on paper, not in 10 or 20 years.  

JA: I feel that this WG will not be able to
&gt; evaluate the general CAT and specific IFF proposals
&gt; in an informed manner without a diligent effort on
&gt; the part of its proponents and supporters to clear
&gt; up many popular misapprehensions about the entire
&gt; category-theoretic approach.  And again, I think
&gt; that I have done as much yeomen service in this
&gt; connection as any of its proposers, 

JS: OK, if this will help IFF, could you submit your insight to the IFF
editor in the form of comments and improvements to the document?  He will
then resolve each of your comments?  Or, is there some other way you can
tie your input directly to improving IFF.  You can ignore SUMO if you can
relate your work to IFF.   



JA: &gt; Again, I am hardly the only person here who believes that both of 
&gt; these documents
&gt; are too immature/premature to be worthy of closing off general 
&gt; discussion.  It was
&gt; constantly advertised to us in the run-up to the votes on these 
&gt; documents that we
&gt; should in no way be putting ourselves in ball &amp; chain by approving 
&gt; them.

JS: There's no restriction on submitting new documents.  Some amount of
general discussion is OK, but too much means people can't read it all and
might miss the real work of the group.
&gt; 
JA: &gt; Writing a good enough ontology standard is not something that folks
&gt; can just spin out of their own bitty brains one fine summer's day.

JS: You may not believe this group can develop an adequate standard, and
I respect your right to feel that way, but that does not give you the
right to post so many messages that aren't contributing much to the
document(s) we need to make progess on.

&gt; 
&gt; JA, quoting his audible hallucination:
&gt; 
&gt; | You want to use the &quot;appropriate best current&quot; (ABC) information 
&gt; and technology,
&gt; | but until you do your literature review you don't really know what 
&gt; ABC is.

JS: I agree we need to be aware of existing work, but if you want to post
such messages, you'll have to directly related them to the work of this
group.  

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand this.  If this were just an election or an 
&gt; opinion poll,
&gt; then a person who votes more times than others would of course be 
&gt; subject to
&gt; special sanction.  But if this is a matter of doing work toward 
&gt; common goals,
&gt; then nobody normally complains if somebody else does more work than 
&gt; them.

JS: Nobody questions the amount of work you are doing.  The problem is
that it doesn't end up contributing to the documents we're supposed to be
developing. Plus, it clogs 180 people's inboxes.


JA: If others complain to 
&gt; you
&gt; that I am not, then I ask that they present their complaints in 
&gt; public
&gt; forum, so that the objections and objectors can themselves be known.

JS: There have been more than enough public complaints over the past
year.

JS: So the bottom line, you need to either directly relate your posting
to the work of this group (i.e. standards words) or substantially reduce
the volume of your postings.
