&gt; Pat Hayes said:
&gt; 
&gt; There is an alternative conclusion, which is that alternative ways of 
&gt; thinking about a topic might all be equally valid and coherent, even 
&gt; though they differ from one another. The proposal to find a single 
&gt; coherent upper-level ontology then amounts to an insistence that all 
&gt; but one of these alternative ways of thinking are wrong. This is a 
&gt; kind of intellectual fascism which has never succeeded in the past 
&gt; several thousand years, and is unlikely to make progress now either. 
&gt; Maybe the SUO should focus on ways of allowing alternative 
&gt; conceptions of the world to co-exist, rather than trying to legislate 
&gt; which of them is 'right'. That approach would at least have the merit 
&gt; of providing a standard that more than a small fraction of the user 
&gt; base could use without discomfort.
&gt; 
&gt; Amalgamating theories will be difficult, just as most large-scale 
&gt; engineering tasks are difficult. There is no magic way around this 
&gt; fact of life.

I agree with Pat;s concerns.  I recently had a conversation with Michael
Gruninger on this topic. Here are some of the results of that. I don't think
there is any *right* SUO, but hey, it is not call the RUO, now is it?
Seriously, though, one can think of different kinds of differences in an
ontology building exercise. One might think about them as lying on a continuum
ranging from indicental to incompatible.

1. INCIDENTAL - that is to say, they do not really matter, there are
differences that could be resolved with minimal to bother and fuss and in the
end, the fact that there is a standard is one then most benefit from, despite
some pet peeves that some may have after losing the battle to include their
favorite feature or approach.

N. INCOMPATIBLE: there are fundamental differences that are incompatible. Both
are 'right' in their respective contexts. One has to choose what to use in a
given set of circumstances.

A good example of a difference at the low end of the spectrum may be Common
Listp. The difference were many and hotly fought over, but ultimately, most
benefit from having a standard.

A good example of a difference at the incompatible end is models for time, as
explicated in Pat Hayes excellent paper catologing models for time.

There are also many many cases where the differences are in between.

Our challenge, then, is to find out what the differences are, and to decide
where they fall along the continuum. If they are incidental, we can iron out
useful standards. If they are incomptible, we need to clearly explicate them in
the manner demonstrated by Pat's catalog of time models. A good output of the
SUO project would be to have many such catalogs for many different domains.
The next and perhaps harder step would/will? be to find out a method for
knowing when and how different models/theories can be combined compatibly.


this is a BIG challenge.  A collection of such papers submittd to the SUO
workshp at IJCAI would be excellent.
