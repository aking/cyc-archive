&gt; 
&gt; Dear Jon and Jean-Marc,
&gt; 
&gt; I keep only the end of your discussion there:

JA:  I do not think that you get what formal models are for.
     They are not intent to exhaust the being or even meant
     to exhaust the description of any real thing.  At best,
     they capture something of importance about that thing,
     enough to get by for a while.  There does not have to
     be any confounded kind of gawd-aweful death-struggle
     between formal and practical.  The choice of a formal
     model is a practical decision.  Formal is beautiful
     and beautiful is practical, like I done tole you.

JM:  Yes, but if a formal model is too all-encompassing, as a result
     of which some things become sign which otherwise would not have
     been signs practically, its usefulness is limited to theoretical
     speculations detached from reality.

&gt; I will take a personnal "centrist" position as regard to these issues:
&gt; both of you look to be at the same time right and wrong as it seems to me.
&gt; I often think that someone could undertake to give an account of the whole,
&gt; large and great system of Peirce as a trial to answer this unique and simple
&gt; question:  To what extent the logical categories (where logical here means
&gt; formal) can correspond to the categories of common experience?

Bernard, here is how I phrase the question in my dissertation,
entitled:  "Inquiry Driven Systems:  An Inquiry Into Inquiry".

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~DISSERTATION~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

1.2  Onus of the Project:  No Way But Inquiry

At the beginning of inquiry there is nothing for me to work with
but the actual constellation of doubts and beliefs that I have
at the moment.  Beliefs that operate at the deepest levels can
be taken so far for granted that they rarely if ever obtrude
on awareness.  Doubts that oppress in the most obvious ways
are still known only as debits and droughts, as the absence
of something, one knows not what, and a desire that obliges
one only to try.  Obscure forms of oversight provide an
impulse to replenish the condition of privation but never
out of necessity afford a sense of direction.  One senses
there ought to be a way out at once, or ordered ways to
overcome obstruction, or organized or otherwise ways to
obviate one's opacity of omission and rescue a secure
motivation from the array of conflicting possibilities.
In the roughest sense of the word, any action that does
in fact lead out of this onerous state can be regarded
as a form of "inquiry".  Only later, in moments of more
leisurely inquiry, when it comes down to classifying and
comparing the manner of escapes that can be recounted,
does it become possible to recognize the ways in which
certain general patterns of strategy are routinely more
successful in the long run than others.

1.2.1  A Modulating Prelude

If I aim to devise the kind of computational support that
can give the greatest assistance to inquiry, then it must be
able to come in at the very beginning, to be of service in the
kinds of formless and negative conditions that I just described,
and to help people navigate a way through the constellations of
contingent, incomplete, and contradictory indications that
they actually find themselves sailing under at present.

In the remainder of this section I will try to indicate as briefly
as possible the nature of the problem that must be faced in this
particular approach to inquiry, and to explain what a large share
of the ensuing fuss will be directed toward clearing up.

Toward the end of this discussion I will be using highly
concrete mathematical models, that is, very specific families
of combinatorial objects, to represent the abstract structures
of experiential sequences that agents pass through.  If these
primitive and simplified models are to be regarded as something
more than mere toys, and if the relations of particular experiences
to particular models, along with the structural relationships that
exist within the field of experiences and again within the collection
of models, are not to be dismissed as category confusions, then I will
need to develop a toolbox of logical techniques that can be used to
justify these constructions.  The required technology of categorical
and relational notions will be developed in the process of addressing
its basic task:  To show how the same conceptual categories can be
applied to materials and models of experience that are radically
diverse in their specific contents and peculiar to the states
of the particular agents to which they attach.

1.2.2  A Fugitive Canon

The principal difficulties associated with this task
appear to spring from two roots.

First, there is the issue of "computational mediation".
In using the sorts of sequences that computers go through
to mediate discussion of the sorts of sequences that people
go through, it becomes necessary to re-examine all of the
facilitating assumptions that are commonly taken for granted
in relating one human experience to another, that is, in
describing and building structural relationships among
the experiences of human agents.

Second, there is the problem of "representing the general in the particular".
How is it possible for the most particular imaginable things, namely, the
transient experiential states of agents, to represent the most general
imaginable things, namely, the agents' own conceptions of the abstract
categories of experience?

Finally, not altogether as an afterthought, there is a question that
binds these issues together.  "How does it make sense to apply one's
individual conceptions of the abstract categories of experience, not
only to the experiences of oneself and others, but in points of form
to compare them with the structures present in mathematical models?"

<A  HREF="http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm">http://www.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm</A>

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~NOITATRESSID~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

&gt; His answer goes through the concepts of sign and pragmatism among others.
&gt; Such concepts are some kind of analytical tools to make the answer more and
&gt; more determinate (Thanks to Jon for is citation thread about "determination").
&gt; The program of CSP does not reside in the opposition between formalism and
&gt; experience but on the contrary in the mystery of the possibility of a unique
&gt; synthesis (how formal resolves in experience and how experience really is formal).
&gt; Neither is formal a matter of practical decision choice as Jon says, ...

Well, that is not exactly what I said.  Compare and contrast:

1.  "The formal is a matter of practical decision choice"  (Bernard Morand).
2.  "The choice of a formal model is a practical decision" (Jon Awbrey).

My favorite illustration of what I mean goes like this:

Q.  What is the psychological meaning of infinity?

A.  [N &lt; 30] = Finite.
    [N &gt; 30] = Infinite.

    CAD (= Computationally Apt Decision):

    [N &lt; 30] =&gt; Use Binominal Distribution.
    [N &gt; 30] =&gt; Use Normal Distribution.

It is in the sense that is exemplified here that I say:
"The choice of a formal model is a practical decision".

&gt; nor experience is a matter of reality as Jean-Marc seems to tell us.
&gt; This program is a trial.  That is to say that the final response is
&gt; on inquiry.  From this fact some eminent thinkers have concluded
&gt; that such a peircean program failed (because it could not exhibit
&gt; a proof for pragmatism for example).
&gt; I dont think so.

Me neither.

Jon Awbrey
