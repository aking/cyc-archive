JA = Jon Awbrey
MW = Matthew West

JA: Short answer:  To the extent that a concrete syntax for 
    FOL is built on the foundation of a concrete syntax for
    ZOL, and to the extent that the underlying concrete
    foundation is poured from the conglomerate mixer of
    PABloid logic, the entire superstructure of the
    logical edifice that is erected on this site
    will continue to rest -- if you can call
    that rest -- on the fault lines of
    a radically undermind neural plate 
    architectonics.  Furthermore, the
    PABlematic foundation presents
    a practical obstacle to
    constructing several
    other very useful,
    almost indispensable
    extensions to the basic
    infrastructure of ZOL, like
    the differential extension and
    the higher order propositional
    extension, which latter affords the
    mind with novel views on the vistas
    of a generalized quantificational logic.

MW: This boils down to FOL not being foundational enough
    for you, i.e. there is other stuff that it rests on.

JA: another reason to distrust short answers.
    and not really my strong point, anyway.
    so let me try to compound the fault.

JA: shorter answer:  no, i think everyone would agree
    that 1 is founded on 0.  but we are talking about
    numerals (the signs) not numbers (the objects),
    to unpack the metaphor, concrete formal languages
    or systems of syntax, or, returning to metaphor,
    we are trying to make comparisons among chinese,
    mayan, roman, arabic, binary, primes, and other
    systems of numerals, to ask which serves us better
    for a particular objective that we might name.

MW: So you are saying that as a matter of principle
    you need to be able to support different ways of
    representing a concept, because different ones are
    useful for different purposes? KIF is just one such,
    not all such.

not sure.  more like this.  we are currently involved
in a design task where we have to consider different
ways of realizing an abstractly specified objective --
notice that &quot;abstractly specified objective&quot; does
not of necessity mean that the objective itself
is abstract.  reverting to metaphor once again,
let's say that we have to choose among several
different concrete roads for getting to the
real world locale to which the abstract
symbol &quot;Dublin&quot; most commonly attaches
and most frequently brings to most
folks' minds.

from a pragmatic perspective, languages are artifacts, implements,
instru-mentalities, &quot;organs&quot; (in the original greek sense), that
are designed to cover worlds of objectives.  in some cases the
designer is nature's evolutionary geppetto, in some cases it's
up to us.  if a thing is designed to a purpose, and if we are
at all capable of thinking deliberately and rationally about
design to a purpose -- instead of spending all of our time
hiring fancy lawyers to write the disclaimers thereof --
then it must be possible to compare different designs
in regard to an object, and to ask if any of them
are better or not.

the question divides doubly at this point:

1.  intra-linguistic comparisons.

    a.  intra-linguistic comparisons in regard to one object.

    b.  intra-linguistic comparisons over a range of objects.

2.  inter-lingustic comparisons.

    a.  inter-linguistic comparisons in regard to one object.

    b.  inter-linguistic comparisons over a range of objects.

notice that i speak &quot;in regard to&quot; (irt) objects, not concepts.
that is not a slip, and it is not accidental.  in the pragmatic
perspective -- actually the way that i'm using the term &quot;concept&quot;
was the common understanding among educated folks until relatively
recently, when a &quot;vast and growing literature of papers&quot; (vaglop)
written by folks who are educated to disdain anything so basic
in the way of actually practicing their espoused intellectual
virtues as the simple doing of their homework has blown up --
anyway, to a pragmatic thinker a &quot;concept&quot; is just a sign,
and so a system of concepts is yet another language of
the kind whereof we speak.

ultimately, of course, we are interested in comparing whole systems of signs
in regard to their differentially adaptive advantages and potentials, their
&quot;fitness&quot;, to use the old evolutionary term, in the struggle to understand
whole systems of existence, and thus, one would hope, to exist.

p.s.  %b%?  i usually just read it &quot;peirce be peirce&quot;.
