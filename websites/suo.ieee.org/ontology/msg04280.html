Note 3

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

Let us now return to John Dewey's &quot;Rainy Day Inquiry&quot;
or &quot;Sign of Rain&quot; example, and this time put it under
the microscope and look at a few of its finer details.
In particular, I can use it to illustrate a couple of
important issues:

1.  The interpretive aspect of inquiry as a semiotic process.
2.  The differential aspect of inquiry as a dynamic process.

For ease of reference, I repeat here the original story:

| A man is walking on a warm day.  The sky was clear the last
| time he observed it;  but presently he notes, while occupied
| primarily with other things, that the air is cooler.  It occurs
| to him that it is probably going to rain;  looking up, he sees a
| dark cloud between him and the sun, and he then quickens his steps.
| What, if anything, in such a situation can be called thought?  Neither
| the act of walking nor the noting of the cold is a thought.  Walking is
| one direction of activity;  looking and noting are other modes of activity.
| The likelihood that it will rain is, however, something 'suggested'.  The
| pedestrian 'feels' the cold;  he 'thinks of' clouds and a coming shower.
|
| John Dewey, 'How We Think', 1910, pages 6-7.

Susan Awbrey and I discussed this example in our article
&quot;Interpretation as Action:  The Risk of Inquiry&quot; that we
gave at a Conference on &quot;Hermeneutics and Human Sciences&quot;
in 1992, a revision of which was subsequently published
in 'Inquiry:  Critical Thinking Across the Disciplines',
Volume 15, No. 1, pages 40-52, (Autumn 1995), which is
available via the Arisbe Homestead or these next links:

<A  HREF="http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/aboutcsp.htm">http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/aboutcsp.htm</A>

Here is what we said about the sign-theoretic aspects
of the inquiry process that we were able to detect in
Dewey's example:

o-----------------------------------------------------------o
|                                                           |
|                        o Sign (cool air, dark cloud)      |
|                       /                                   |
|                      /                                    |
|                     /                                     |
|   Object o---------@                                      |
|   (rain)            \                                     |
|                      \                                    |
|                       \                                   |
|                        o Interpretant (thought of rain)   |
|                                                           |
o-----------------------------------------------------------o
Figure 1.  Sign Relation in Dewey's &quot;Sign of Rain&quot;

| In this narrative we can identify the characters of the sign relation as follows:
| 'coolness' is a Sign of the Object 'rain', and the Interpretant is 'the thought
| of the rain's likelihood'.  In his 1910 description of reflective thinking
| Dewey distinguishes two phases, &quot;a state of perplexity, hesitation, doubt&quot;
| and &quot;an act of search or investigation&quot; (Dewey 1991, 9), comprehensive
| stages which are further refined in his later model of inquiry.
| In this example, reflection is the act of the interpreter which
| establishes a fund of connections between the sensory shock of
| coolness and the objective danger of rain, by way of his
| impression that rain is likely.  But reflection is more
| than irresponsible speculation.  In reflection the
| interpreter acts to charge or defuse the thought
| of rain (the probability of rain in thought) by
| seeking other signs which this thought implies
| and evaluating the thought according to the
| results of this search.

Next I'd like to take up the differential aspect
of inquiry as a dynamic process of theory change.

But first a word of excuse for the present method:

| Note on Relevance &amp; Utility of Miniature Models.
|
| For reasons of the briefest possible exposition,
| I have elected to discuss the subject matter in
| the medium of a just barely non-trivial example.
| In order to appreciate the point and the thrust
| of any such radically impoverished test example
| it is necessary to recognize the application of
| one or two limiting principles to the axiomatic
| expressions of its thus-purported circumstances:
|
| 1.  Gensym Fallacy.  The sense and the significance of
|     the circumstantial description is circumscribed by
|     the logical form and the number of terms it enjoys.
|
| 2.  Ginseng Truism.  The sense and the significance of
|     the circumstantial description is circumscribed by
|     the logical form and the number of terms it enjoys.
|
| In particular, even though it is bound to appear for the moment that
| I am restricting my presentation to &quot;axiom change operators&quot; (ACO's)
| that act locally on the points of a given logical configuration in
| a fixed lattice of propositional facts or terms, it will be clear
| that a &quot;zeroth order theory&quot; (ZOT) that is presented by a finite
| set of &quot;zeroth order axioms&quot; (ZOA) is itself equivalent to the
| conjunction of these axioms, and thus to a single proposition
| in the appropriate &quot;zeroth order ordering&quot; (ZOO).  In effect,
| one whole ZOO is encapsulated by a single point in another.
|
| Anyway, I think that is right, but it's a thought whose
| consequences I am still struggling to grasp fully, and
| so maybe I will eventually discover a problem with it.

Returning to the example in question, let me now draw
a more expansive picture of the &quot;Rainy Day&quot; situation,
one that adduces to the account some consideration of
what our peripatetic or precipitate hero was probably
doing and thinking, however consciously or other-wise,
just slightly before the imaginary events in question.

You see, our hero did not begin his life with the
shock of cool air on his skin, well, not on this
particular, late ambulatory occasion, but had
a prior distribution of default assumptions
about what his day was going to be like.

Just to extrapolate in a plausible vein of our imagination,
let us play along and say that the initial facts were thus:

    A_1  =  Air warm

    B_1  =  Balmy day

    C_1  =  Clear sky

Pulling the &quot;conventional contingency&quot; or &quot;customary connection&quot; trick,
let us then relativize the array of this data in the following fashion:

    C =  Current situation

    C =&gt; A_1

    C =&gt; B_1

    C =&gt; C_1

For the moment, let this figure of a &quot;current situation&quot; C
be one that is allowed to &quot;go with the flow&quot;, letting its
letter be re-used to anchor whatever the case may become.

Now I do not know if it has to be the case that these three
features of the current situation had ever been entertained
by our ambler in any particular order, but we might suppose
their relative consistency as consisting in some such scene
as this:  The hiker has formed a prior assumption about the
Case that applies to the current situation, let's say, that
the day is balmy, C =&gt; B_1, an assumption that he will keep
as a default to continue in the same way until there arises
a reason to think otherwise.  Further, we may imagine quite
plausibly that a Rule of the form B_1 =&gt; A_1 can be applied
to the Case C =&gt; B_1 to deduce the expectation of a certain
Fact, namely, that the current situation will feature among
its phenomena the qualities of the air being warm, C =&gt; A_1.

So this logical set-up, or the likes of it, is what we may assume,
at least, plausibly enough for our currently illustrative purpose,
as the logical environ into which our soon to be inquiring ambler
strolls one fine and for the moment sunny day.

The rest you know.  The cooler air, A_2, sensually contests
and logically contradicts the continuing assumption of the
prior condition A_1, demanding a fresh evaluation of the
conditioning assumption B_1, altering it into the new
hypothesis B_2, boding rain, which abduced Case is
corrobated to a moderate degree by looking up and
spying a cloud in the sky, C_2.

Figure 2 manages to sum it all up in a fairly consummate fashion:

Figure 2.  Sign of Rain, The Prequel

I will try to keep this thread tightly anchored to problems of
belief and concept development, the applications of inquiry to
the process, and the requirements for software tools that will
be needed to facilitate these tasks.

I will also try to fix a more narrow bead on the points
where inquiry processes lead us to adduce new symbols to
an existing belief system, conceptual framework, data base,
knowledge base, ontology, theory, or whatever you may call it,
to modify a selection of old axioms, beliefs, concepts already
there, or to else to cast the sorry theory aside and start fresh.

We have have already seen several clues that these software tools
will have to go well beyond the brands of theorem provers that we
have gotten accustomed to employing in the past.  Just to mention
one consideration, your run of the mill theorem provers have been
tailored for specialized subsets of deductive reasoning, and as a
result they are not all that well adapted to or easily integrated
with the manners of their more inductive database and statistical
cousins, and they provide almost no support for concept formation,
hypothesis generation, and the other varieties of abductive tasks.
