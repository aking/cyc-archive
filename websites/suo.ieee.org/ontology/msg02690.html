Bizarre!  Of course I have heard it all before,
but I always get this peculiar sensation of irony
when I see somebody write this sort of stuff in this
particular medium, since I know that the work of those
dastardly misleaders Chomsky &amp; Schutzenberger is built
into just about every parser and every program that
manipulates these syn-tactless aspersions of them.

| N. Chomsky and M.P. Schutzenberger,
|"The Algebraic Theory of Context-Free Languages",
|'Computer Programming and Formal Systems',
| North-Holland Publishing Company, 1963.

Chomsky did what every sensible thinker does, when presented
with some overwhelmingly complex material or phenomenon that
he or she really wants to understand, in all of its gory and
not so automatically a push over for axioms in the manner of
those who would just blow smoke all around it, and that's to
find a reasonable way to simplify the problem into something
that a mere mortal can handle at first blush.  These species
of specious remarks are even more sublimely ridiculous given
in a forum where most people have yet to escape those searly
bounds of strait-jacketed assumptions that were wound around
our brains by none other than Aristotle, again, swaddling us
in approximations that were sensible in his time -- but now!?

&gt; Pat is right that linguistic theories tend to start from "bottom" up
&gt; examining syntax and grammar without any real theory of "meaning" upon
&gt; which to base it.  They then proceed to "semantics" and "pragmatics" to
&gt; account for word meaning, sentence meaning, and context-based meaning.
&gt; But linguists, IMHO, haven't done a great subject in explaining what
&gt; "meaning" is and how we can communicate meaning -- they just take
&gt; for granted that it's there.

When we get as far as specifying a non-trivial syntax,
then maybe we can begin to judge.

&gt; I have found philosophy of knowledge (e.g., John Searle) and
&gt; sociology of knowledge (e.g., social construction theory) far
&gt; more illuminating into the problems we are facing concerning
&gt; "meaning".  The social theories I think are most practical
&gt; and realistic:  when it comes down it, an element of our
&gt; ontology "means" what we negotiate and use it to mean.
&gt; (In fact, I believe that we can't do anything OTHER
&gt; than this.)  Wrt the SUO, this means identifying
&gt; ourselves as an ontology-usage community (or
&gt; "information community", to use the GIS
&gt; researchers term), negotiate and accept
&gt; an SUO (and meaning of it's elements)
&gt; and *create*a*plan* for how it will
&gt; *evolve*in*response to usage.

These are interseting topic areas, of course, but they remain
at present in a state of pre-scientific speculation, in which
pretty much everybody can pick from the smorgasbord of things
that they would most like to believe.  The fact that most of
our 20th Century Illiterati did not bother to check out what
had gone before tells us that we are still in the realm of
cyclic and mythical time, the intellectual historical Id.

Just my hazy impression,

Jon Awbrey
