Re: ification SIG,

Sometimes, when I cannot figure out what to think about a subject,
I resort to gathering together a deliberate or a desultory array
of source materials -- sometimes in a duly dedicated spirit to
make an &quot;objective&quot; (&lt;- ScareQuotes) survey of the literature,
sometimes in a selectively biased frame of mind that is merely
meant to remind myself of what I am already inclined to think
about the matter.  This will, of course, be one of the latter
sorts of resorts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accumulated Source Materials:

| Hypostasis:  Literally the Greek word signifies that which stands under
| and serves as a support.  In philosophy it means a singular substance,
| also called a supposite, 'suppositum', by the Scholastics, especially
| if the substance is a completely subsisting one, whether non-living
| or living, irrational or rational.  However, a rational hypostasis
| has the same meaning as the term, 'person'.
|
| J.J.R. [= J.J. Rolbiecki] in:
|
| Dagobert D. Runes (ed.), 'Dictionary of Philosophy',
| Littlefield, Adams, &amp; Company, Totowa, NJ, 1972.


| Exceedingly important are the relatives signifying
| &quot;- is a quality of -&quot; and &quot;- is a relation of - to -&quot;.
| It may be said that mathematical reasoning (which
| is the only deductive reasoning, if not absolutely,
| at least eminently) almost entirely turns on the
| consideration of abstractions as if they were objects.
| The protest of nominalism against such hypostatisation,
| although, if it knew how to formulate itself, it would
| be justified as against much of the empty disputation of
| the medieval Dunces, yet, as it was and is formulated, is
| simply a protest against the only kind of thinking that has
| ever advanced human culture.  Nobody will work long with the
| logic of relatives -- unless he restricts the problems of his
| studies very much -- without seeing that this is true.  (CP 3.509).
|
| Charles Sanders Peirce, &quot;The Logic of Relatives&quot;,
| 'The Monist', Volume 7, pages 161-217, 1897.
| 'Collected Papers', CP 3.456-552.


| But the highest kind of synthesis is what the mind is compelled to make neither
| by the inward attractions of the feelings or representations themselves, nor by
| a transcendental force of necessity, but in the interest of intelligibility,
| that is, in the interest of the synthesizing &quot;I think&quot; itself;  and this it
| does by introducing an idea not contained in the data, which gives connections
| which they would not otherwise have had.  This kind of synthesis has not been
| sufficiently studied, and especially the intimate relationship of its different
| varieties has not been duly considered.  The work of the poet or novelist is not
| so utterly different from that of the scientific man.  The artist introduces a
| fiction;  but it is not an arbitrary one;  it exhibits affinities to which the
| mind accords a certain approval in pronouncing them beautiful, which if it is not
| exactly the same as saying that the synthesis is true, is something of the same
| general kind.  The geometer draws a diagram, which if not exactly a fiction, is
| at least a creation, and by means of observation of that diagram he is able to
| synthesize and show relations between elements which before seemed to have no
| necessary connection.  The realities compel us to put some things into very
| close relation and others less so, in a highly complicated, and in the [to? --
| my guess is &quot;true&quot; -- J.A.] sense itself unintelligible manner;  but it is the
| genius of the mind, that takes up all these hints of sense, adds immensely to
| them, makes them precise, and shows them in intelligible form in the intuitions
| of space and time.  Intuition is the regarding of the abstract in a concrete form,
| by the realistic hypostatization of relations;  that is the one sole method of
| valuable thought.  Very shallow is the prevalent notion that this is something
| to be avoided.  You might as well say at once that reasoning is to be avoided
| because it has led to so much error;  quite in the same philistine line of
| thought would that be;  and so well in accord with the spirit of nominalism
| that I wonder some one does not put it forward.  The true precept is not to
| abstain from hypostatization, but to do it intelligently ... (CP 1.383).

Re: ification SIG,

Just enough time to insert a genealogical note:

<A  HREF="http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/b/bentham.htm">http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/b/bentham.htm</A>

Bentham's &quot;Theory of Fictions&quot; begat (paraphrastically)
Schönfinkel's &quot;Bausteine&quot; and this begat (independently)
Church's &quot;Lambda Calculus&quot; and this begat (in good time)
McCarthy's &quot;Lisp&quot; and all the rest is AI and IEEE ...

By way of stuffing the e-lectural ballot boxes just a little bit better
I will attach here some bits of an ongoing dialectric that a few of the
denizens of the Peirce List, most especially Tom Gollier and yours truly,
have been carrying on intermittently for quite some time now, regarding
this most atmospheric of all topics of our current concern, to wit, the
question of hypostatic electricity, of how or whether it can ever stick.

This will also serve to throw a new synonym into the mix:  &quot;subjectal abstraction&quot;.

TG: I knew there was no sense getting carried away until you'd had a chance
    to straighten out the context, and your mathematical orientation, which
    is not foreign to Peirce's either, was clear in our previous exchanges
    on the list.  But I don't think mathematicians are to be trusted in
    this regard;  not from any moral flaw in their characters but
    because they're treating this subject of generalization
    within an abstract realm, and hence they feel no need
    or compulsion to make a distinction between the two.

JA: For me, generalization begins in a fairly concrete realm --
    I take &quot;concrete&quot; to mean &quot;grown together&quot;, suggesting the
    concrescence of attributes or the fusion of features that
    go to constitute a definite, particulate, and vivid object --
    the action passes through a series of mental affections or
    cognitive impressions -- the only place where such a passage
    is possible without actually destroying the original object --
    toward a conceptual symbol that has a more abstract reference,
    to wit, a selection of the attributes, characters, features,
    marks, or properties that were initially conceived to make up
    the object.  There is a common form to this general direction
    of thought, whether the objects are apples and oranges being
    generalized under the nomen of fruits, or whether the objects
    are numbers under addition and numbers under multiplication
    being generalized under the the nomen of groups.

JA: Generalization is a relative notion, and there is no more need
    for an absolute ground here than there is for a non-inferential
    perception at the origin of thought.  But the distinction between
    precisive (or prescindive) abstraction and hypostatic (or subjectal)
    abstraction is independent of how abstracted already, how far along
    the continuum or the spectrum of abstraction, happens to be the object
    of thought with which one begins.

JA: Again, hypostatic abstraction is a two-edged sword -- a &quot;subject&quot;
    is now and henceforth &quot;supposed&quot; to &quot;stand its own ground beneath&quot;
    the flight of sorcery of the nominal property that is prescinded
    by the flightier fancy of generalization.

JA: This occurs in concrete domains and in vivid realms as much as in the
    other sort, if there is any other sort.  For instance, I do not know
    you as a person, in person, and all I know of you are these signs
    that issue from my computer under your name.  Naturally, I suppose
    that there is a person who stands behind them, someone who is indeed
    responsible for their generation, as their hypothetical perpetrator --
    this is my act of &quot;hypostation&quot;, or abstractive hypostasis -- in one of
    its senses, and this is no accident, &quot;hypostasis&quot; = &quot;person&quot;, and anyone
    can look it up!  The supposition of a person, an interpretive performer,
    who generates the signs that one passively interprets, indeed, the very
    supposition that there is a person called onself who affords the medium,
    gives a local habitation and a name, and lends a substance to all of the
    signs that constitute the experiences that one calls one's own, well,
    those are acts of &quot;drawing away to stand under&quot; that are fundamental
    to our &quot;under-standing&quot; of ourselves, however fallible, malfeasant,
    and self-deceptive this form of understanding often is.

JA: Four short paragraphs and I have already put myself to sleep --
    you can supply your own joke about dormitive virtues here --
    I pity the person who finds this stuff in his morning post --
    warning:  do not drive or operate heavy machinery while under
    the influence of this philosophy, or any such stuff as these
    dreams are made on!

JA: And with that, I bid you adieu ~~~

Jon Awbrey wrote (JA):

CP: CP 4.332  [Subjectal Abstraction = Hypostatic Abstraction]

    | ... The logical term 'subjectal abstraction' here requires a word
    | of explanation;  for there are few treatises on logic which notice
    | subjectal abstraction under any name, except so far as to confuse
    | it with precisive abstraction which is an entirely different logical
    | function.  When we say that the Columbia library building is 'large',
    | this remark is a result of precisive abstraction by which the man who
    | makes the remark leaves out of account all the other features of his
    | image of the building, and takes [to represent the size] the word
    | &quot;large&quot; which is entirely unlike that image -- and when I say the
    | word is unlike the image, I mean that the general signification
    | of the word is utterly disparate from the image, which involves
    | no predicates at all.  Such is 'precisive abstraction'.  But now
    | if this man goes on to remark that the largeness of the building is
    | very impressive, he converts the applicability of that predicate from
    | being a way of thinking about the building to being itself a subject
    | of thought, and that operation is 'subjectal abstraction'.  (CP 4.332).

    | Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 4.332

JA: I think that the relation between 'hypostation', that mode of mental operation
    that passes from a verb in action to a noun in stasis, that turn or that style
    of thoughtful conduct that converts a &quot;way of thinking&quot; (WOT) about some thing
    into a &quot;subject of thought&quot; (SOT) itself, and 'reflection', that &quot;bending back&quot;
    and &quot;folding over&quot; of thought on itself, is strikingly clear in this depiction.

JA: Now, this is where I came in -- that is, it is just the point that I had reached
    in my thinking at the end of last year when I decided to take a little break from
    my day to day mental grind to see what sorts of diversion I might find on the web.
    Little did I know how the play would play out!  But the place in question, where
    a peculiar form of reflexive complication found itself tied and once again begins
    to tighten, is the place where one rises from an ongoing activity, whatever it is,
    to reflect on what one is doing, perhaps with a critical eye, and this is where the
    activity that one was cast into, thrown into, willy nilly, and not entirely awarely,
    begins to appear, by virtue of the reflective image that is formed by the reflection,
    like an object, that is, an objective form of conduct, like a chess game, that one
    can choose to play or not, and even consider how to generalize and how to transform.

JA: Not too coincidentally, this is the place where the mental operations that implement
    precisive and subjectal abstraction, namely, selection and reflection, respectively,
    begin to highlight the importance that Dewey placed on a favorite couple of words of
    his, namely, &quot;activity&quot; and &quot;reflection&quot;.  An ongoing activity gradually acquires an
    activity of reflection as a parallel rider, then the activity of reflection is turned,
    chiasmatically, into a reflection on activity.  As far as I am concerned, this is the
    true significance of hypostatic abstraction, that takes us from a point in medias res,
    of an action that engages us, to a stance that is just a little bit outside the action,
    a change of attitude or a shift of status toward the activity that is marked by our
    ability to name the action or the state of becoming by means of an abstract noun.

JA: In my case, it is the activity of inquiry that I am wondering how and thus beginning
    to reflect on, and this reflection is a critical component of the inquiry into inquiry.
    That is a very nice description, I think, so far as it goes, but how can I teach this
    skill of reflection to a rock, of the sort that we mine from silicon valley?

JA: Like I said, this is where I came in,
    and I seem to be leaving by the very
    same door by which I entered.

JA: And so it goes,

JA: Jon
