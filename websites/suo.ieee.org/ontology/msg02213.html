Matthew,

As I continue to await the inspiration of
"a general and phenomenal epiphany" (AGAPE)
on the subject(s) of teridentity &amp; triadicity,
I will occupy myself, in these mean times, with
developing and elaborating, in my more plodding
manner, the current concretions about relations.

I will continue the practice, lately instituted,
of making the current ply of replies unindented,
indexically indenting them on subsequent passes,
and I may try, a bit provisionally, to weed out
patches of deader wood from our running on talk.

In order to keep from getting too tangled up in the
temporal skein, I will put new stuff toward the end.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Thread 1

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  One reason I am pursuing this discussion is that
     if there really are things it cannot handle,
     I would really like to know.

JA:  I always take people at their word,
     so I take you as really wanting to know:
     The POV that you have been exposing here
     cannot handle 3-adic relations in any way,
     if by "handle" you mean "not destroying" the
     information contained in their apt expressions.

JA:  The "Pat Hayes Omni-Potential Change Of Variables Formula" (PHOPCOVF)
     has now been exposed as the "change of subject" (COS) formula that it
     really is at heart, and the author of it has admitted that nobody ever
     meant to say what some people once pretended that it said, as have you,
     too, in regard to a co-indited point.

MW:  Well I noticed that you claimed to have overturned Pat's proof,
     but I am not sufficiently versed in these things to be sure
     that you are not employing the same kinds of tricks that
     you claim Pat has employed.

Just to be clear who is actually saying these things, and that
I am not "Just Whistling Dixie", as we onetime confederates say,
here are the 'ipse dixit's:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~EXHIBIT~A~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Speaking of truth-functional connectives,

Pat Hayes premissed:

| If you insist that it is a function on truthvalues
| and therefore a ternary relation, then I will concede
| that such things are needed.  However, I will then assert
| even more strongly the utter banality and unimportance of
| this result.  As far as I know, nobody, not even Scheffer,
| has ever asserted that one can do without binary connectives.

Jon Awbrey concluded [It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it]:

| Substituting identicals into what I hope is your transparent context:
| 
| Therefore nobody is saying that one can do without triadic relations.
|
| The End.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~EXHIBIT~B~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  Why do you think anyone would want to say this?
     If you are going to take a simple KIF binary relation
     instance and represent it in a relational database, and
     you want to do some basic data management of that relation,
     you need several columns to do it.  You need 3 columns (plus
     the table name) as a minimum to have the equivalent expressive
     power in a single record to something like:

     (R x y)

MW:  Now in KIF when elsewhere you want to refer to (R x y)
     you just state it again there.  In a database you don't,
     you make a surrogate for the object that is represented,
     and use that.  So if KIF used a similar approach you would
     have something like:

     #1 (R x y)

MW:  Well you would need to be pretty dumb not to see
     that this is 4 elements you need to find a place for.
     Even with one of them being the table name you are left
     with 3 (minimum).

MW:  So to suggest that there is an equivalence
     between a binary relation and a table with
     2 columns is either ignorant or mischevous.

| 3.  The Three Great Data Models
| 
| 3.1  The Relational Data Model
|
| The mathematical concept underlying the relational model is the
| set-theoretic 'relation', which is a subset of the Cartesian product
| of a list of domains.  A 'domain' is simply a set of values.  ...
| The 'Cartesian product' of domains D&lt;1&gt;, D&lt;2&gt;, ..., D&lt;k&gt;, written
| D&lt;1&gt; x D&lt;2&gt; x ... x D&lt;k&gt;, is the set of all k-tuples (v&lt;1&gt;, ..., v&lt;k&gt;)
| such that v&lt;1&gt; is in D&lt;1&gt;, v&lt;2&gt; is in D&lt;2&gt;, and so on.  ...
|
| A 'relation' is any subset of the Cartesian product of one or more
| domains.  As far as databases are concerned, it is pointless to discuss
| infinite relations, so we shall assume that a relation is finite unless
| we state otherwise.  ...
|
| The members of a relation are called 'tuples'.  Each relation that
| is a subset of D&lt;1&gt; x D&lt;2&gt; x ... x D&lt;k&gt; is said to have 'arity' k.
| A tuple (v&lt;1&gt;, v&lt;2&gt;, ..., v&lt;k&gt;) has k 'components';  the i^th
| component is v&lt;i&gt;.  Often we use the shorthand v&lt;1&gt;v&lt;2&gt;...v&lt;k&gt;
| to denote the tuple (v&lt;1&gt;, v&lt;2&gt;, ..., v&lt;k&gt;).
|
| It helps to view a relation as a table, where each row is a tuple and
| each column corresponds to one component.  The columns are often given
| names, called 'attributes'.
|
| Example 3.1.  In Figure 3.1 we see a relation whose attributes
| are CITY, STATE, and POP.  The arity of the relation is three.
| For example, (Miami, Oklahoma, 13880) is a tuple.
|
|     CITY    |   STATE   |    POP
| ¤~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~~~¤
|   San Diego | Texas     |    4490
|   Miami     | Oklahoma  |   13880
|   Pittsburg | Iowa      |     509

MW:  So I'm afraid that is not an argument that will convince me on its own.
     If you wish to do that you will have to present a specific example of
     where the information in some triadic relation cannot be transformed
     into some set of binary relations.  If you provide the triadic relation,
     I will provide the binary relations from which the triadic relation can
     be constructed (or not and admit you are right).

JA:  Still waiting ...

JA:  Just to refresh your memory,
     here are L^0 and L^1 once again:

---------------------------------------------------
|
| Relation L^0
|
| L^0 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 0}.
|
| L^0 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
|
|    &lt;0, 0, 0&gt;
|    &lt;0, 1, 1&gt;
|    &lt;1, 0, 1&gt;
|    &lt;1, 1, 0&gt;
|
---------------------------------------------------
|
| Relation L^1
|
| L^1 = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x + y + z = 1}.
|
| L^1 has the following four triples
| of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3:
|
|    &lt;0, 0, 1&gt;
|    &lt;0, 1, 0&gt;
|    &lt;1, 0, 0&gt;
|    &lt;1, 1, 1&gt;
|

|
---------------------------------------------------

JA:  Let me tell you where I think that you and I stand at present.
     I believe that we have agreed on the ground rules that nothing of
     any rational sense will come of arguing about any puported form of
     "analysis", "decomposition", "discombobulation", "reconstruction",
     "reduction", "transliteration", "transmogrification", or whatever,
     unless we have clearly defined the particular species of relation
     that we are talking about in a case at issue.  Now, for my own part,
     I regard the argument as being effectively over right at this point,
     since I never knew a "form of analysis" (FOA) that pretended to be
     anything other than a relationship among one thing, the analysand,
     and at least two other things, the analytic components.  One plus
     at least two implies at least three, and so the very idea of a FOA
     has us neck deep already in a 3-adic relation.

MW:  But as usual you skip from three things to necessary triadicity.
     In fact the only thing that is required for 3 things (or any
     number of things for that matter) to be related is that in some
     network of relations there is a path that links them together.

JA:  This is one way that we can say, if we speak loosely enough,
     that "three things are related".  People sometimes describe
     this by saying that they are "pairwise related" in such and
     such a way that chosen triples are connected in 2-adic pairs.
     It is what is what we might call some kind of "discombobulatable
     3-adic relation", say, "conjunctively reducible", which is the
     same thing, if I remember correctly, or related to, at least,
     the "projectively reducible" 3-adic relation.  Anyway, there
     are many such special cases of relations, but their existence
     does not affect the general truth that many 3-adic relations
     are not of this kind.  And, once again, the logical forms of
     these very reductions involve 3-adic relations at every step
     of the corresponding analyses.

JA:  For example, contemplate the 3-adic relation that is expressed by
     the rheme "--- is an ordered pair consisting of --- and then ---",
     of which one instantiation is &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt;, and which
     one single instance might be diagrammed as follows:

|                        Jack
|                       o
|                      /
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o---&lt;|
|                      \
|                       o
|                        Jill

JA:  Let us symbolize this 3-adic relation by writing statements
     of the form "LP12 (q, x, y)", of which we have the example
     where LP12 (&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill) is true.

JA:  The 3-adic relation that is meant to be exemplified here,
     of which &lt;&lt;Jack, Jill&gt;, Jack, Jill&gt; is but one exemplar,
     is just the sort of thing that can be expressed in terms
     of certain pairwise connections, say, as we might try to
     suggest by means of the following scheme:

|                        Jack
|                [LP1]--o
|                 /      \
|   &lt;Jack, Jill&gt; o       [L12]
|                 \      /
|                [LP2]--o
|                        Jill

JA:  In this picture, the 2-adic relations LP1, LP2, and L12
     are defined to capture forms of pairwise relations like:

     LP1 (q, x)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     LP2 (q, y)  &lt;=&gt;  y is the 2nd component
                      in the ordered pair q.

     L12 (x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  x is the 1st component &amp;
                      y is the 2nd component
                      in some ordered pair.

JA:  Now, to justify the claim that the original 3-adic relation can be
     defined or expressed in terms of these particular 2-adic relations,
     it is necessary to write out the requisite definition, for example:

     LP12 (q, x, y)  &lt;=&gt;  LP1 (q, x) and LP2 (q, y).

JA:  This, I think, does it.  So here is an example of a 3-adic relation
     that is "definable in terms of" (DITO) 2-adic relations.  This is
     all well and good to say, but it can only be well and good to say
     if one chooses one's words very carefully, as I have in this case.
     There is no mention of a 3-adic relation being "decomposable" to
     2-adic relations, for that would invoke the notion of relational
     composition, on analogy to functional composition, in minds that
     have been exposed to certain early and formative life experiences.

JA:  I would like to interject a note of reservation at this juncture,
     since the definition of LP12 that I gave above is not yet in the
     form that I would consider the tip-top shape for perfect clarity.
     The main thing that it lacks in its current shape is any sort of
     careful circumscriptions of the so-called "domains of definition"
     for the assorted relations that serve defined and defining roles.
     Just as a thing to think about, you might well see reason to ask:
     "What is the domain of definition for the variable q?"  But I do
     not want to get bogged down in all of that now, so let's move on.
     Still, it helps to name these domains:  so "Q", "X", "Y" will do.

JA:  Also, while I'm at it, allow me to convert my temporary terminology
     into what is more like the "standard-usage-onyms" where I come from.
     As a start, notice that the 2-adic relations LP1 and LP2 are actually
     functions from the domain of q to the domains of x and y, respectively.
     In recognition of this fact, it is usual to give them functional names,
     commonly something like the following reformulations of the definitions:

     1.  Proj&lt;1&gt; : XxY -&gt; X such that Proj&lt;1&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; x.

     2.  Proj&lt;2&gt; : XxY -&gt; Y such that Proj&lt;2&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; y.

JA:  And yet, once again, this entire skirmish to mop-up the residual bits
     of 2-adic structure that may be squeegeed out of the original 3-adic
     relation is being waged only after the general issue has been conceded,
     for we had to use the 3-adic relation associated with the truth-functional
     connective "and" just to express the definition of LP12.

JA:  Still, I do not believe that the example that I gave of L^0 and L^1
     is definable or reducible over any 2-adics in even this sort of way.
     At least, I gave a proof that they cannot be projectively reducible,
     and I am yet waiting for you to come up with the promised analysis
     along whatever lines that you might be able to devise.

JA:  While I await those developments, forgive me if I just keep on talking,
     and, who knows, it may even chance to happen that I will say something
     to give you an idea about the relational situation, one way or another.

JA:  What we have just now established, a little ways above,
     is that an ordered pair q is determined by this "data":
     a couple of 2-adic relations, in particular, functions,
     whose names are not of any great importance, but which
     I am now calling the "projections" Proj&lt;1&gt; amd Proj&lt;2&gt;,
     together with the values of q's projections in X and Y.

JA:  Here is a sort of picture that can be useful in helping us
     to remember what is essential in this kind of a relational
     situation, beneath the vast bewildering array of notations:

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o       q   o
|   x7 o     / \ o y7
|    x6 o   /   * y6
|     x5 o /   o y5
|      x4 *   o y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.

At this juncture, I would like to demonstrate a few amusing
diversions that can be found in this genre of illustrations.

We have just illustrated the circumstance -- coincidence?  I think not! --
that a deux-tuple is determined by the details of its projective pieces --
still, according to a sage bit of wisdom, if a deux-tuple did not exist
that was determined by the data of its projective parts, then it should
be necessary to invent one that was -- which is parably what this bible
of pan-categorics tells us about the genesis of every cartesian product:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~RECITATIVE~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| Many properties of mathematical constructions may
| be represented by universal properties of diagrams.
| Consider the cartesian product X x Y of two sets,
| consisting as usual of all ordered pairs &lt;x, y&gt;
| of elements x in X and y in Y.  The projections
| &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; x, &lt;x, y&gt; ~&gt; y of the product on its "axes"
| X and Y are functions p : X x Y -&gt; X, q : X x Y -&gt; Y.
| Any function h : W -&gt; X x Y from a third set W is uniquely
| determined by its composites p o h and q o h.  Conversely,
| given W and two functions f and g as in the diagram below,
| there is a unique function h which makes the diagram commute;
| namely, hw = &lt;fw, gw&gt;:
|
|
|                        W
|                        o
|                       /|\
|                      / | \
|                     /  |  \
|                  f /   h   \ g
|                   /    |    \
|                  /     |     \
|                 /      |      \
|                v       v       v
|               o&lt;---p---o---q---&gt;o
|              X       X x Y       Y
|

So what if we add another character, yclept "p", let us say,
to this little drama of relations that we have set out here?

|           Q
|           =
|         X x Y
|           o
|          o o
|         o   o
|        o     o
|       o       o
|      o         o
|     o   p   q   o
|   x7 o / \ / \ o y7
|    x6 *   .   * y6
|     x5 o / \ o y5
|      x4 *   * y4
|       x3 o o y3
|        x2 o y2
|   X     x1 y1     Y
|
| This picture indicates that Q = X x Y,
| that X = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7},
| that Y = {y1, y2, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7},
| that p = &lt;x5, y3&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(p) = x5, Proj&lt;2&gt;(p) = y3,
| that q = &lt;x3, y5&gt;, or, in other words,
| that Proj&lt;1&gt;(q) = x3, Proj&lt;2&gt;(q) = y5.

Can you guess where this story is going?
I do not wish to spoil your suspense --
so I won't.

The rest is epilogue.

MW:  Now the "semantics" of the linking relations should support
     the derivation of something more complex, but that is all.

JA:  It should support the formal recognition of "something more complex",
     namely, a 3-adic relation which is not reducible to 2-adic relations.

MW:  But to be honest, I don't think what you are really arguing
     for is triadicity in relations as such, but for some things
     that relations are used to represent.  If this were the case,
     then I would probably agree with you.  So let me make a few
     statement about how I see relations.

JA:  This is another one of those places where I fear that we might
     be using the word "relation" in some radically divergent way,
     since I would not naturally speak of a relation in general as
     representing anything, since relations are primarily objects
     of discussion and thought to me, and not syntactic entities.
     The special brand of a relation that I call a "sign relation"
     does indeed have two of its three feet in realms of signs,
     and there are many types of relations that I would choose
     for "modeling" objects and processes in the world, and
     there are very special sorts of relational structures
     in mathematics that are called "group representations",
     so maybe there is a bridge ahead, but I cannot be sure.

MW:  To me relations are purely mathematical constructs.
     They are sets of tuples.  So first of all I see an
     infinity of tuples consisting of all the possible
     combinations of things, and then I see a further
     infinity of sets of these (but let us restrict
     ourselves to those where all the members of the
     set have the same adacity).

MW:  The good news is that we don't have to care about all of them,
     but to a very small subset we choose (note the word choose)
     to map our experiences of the world to in terms of connections
     (broad sense) that we see between things.

MW:  As I see it there is no "necessary" mapping between the world
     and relations (i.e. there is only one choice how to do it).
     I'm not sure you share that view.

MW:  I would suggest that we talked more about what was being represented
     rather than how it was being represented.  I suspect that we would
     then find more to agree about.

JA:  I am afraid that we can only talk about things in so far as we represent them.

JA:  As an object example, taken for the moment in the converse direction
     of synthesis, joining an x and a y to form the set {x, y} is already
     an element of a 3-adic relation, just as every other "binary operation"
     is a 3-adic relation.

MW:  Sorry, I don't agree.  We've been here before.  Binary operations
     are of the form F : a -&gt; b, and even though a and b might be quite
     complex, the essential form is binary.

JA:  I would say that the accidental form, even the superficial form is binary --
     anything at all can be glossed over with a superficially simple appearance --
     it is our job precisely to detect and to reveal the underlying complexities.

JA:  Here, let me try to explain it to you this way.
     The following table presents the 3-adic relation
     that is otherwise known as the 2-ary operation of
     conjunction, commonly symbolized by "and" or "&amp;":

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  Now, let us suppose that you are a humble Data Scrivener,
     as I once was, and your not-so-humble Boss comes to your
     cubicle one day, no doubt pursuant to that data downsize
     directive that I encouraged you to explore in a previous
     scenario, and tells you that you need to get this simple
     structure into a 2-column table at most, which being the
     true believer in economy that you are you promptly do as
     follows:

o-----------o---------o
|&lt; x  ,  y &gt;| z = x&amp;y |
o-----------o---------o
|&lt; 0  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 0  ,  1 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  0 &gt;|    0    |
|&lt; 1  ,  1 &gt;|    1    |
o-----------o---------o

JA:  Whereupon you are promptly rewarded with a well-deserved
     promotion at twice your former salary for the incredible
     shrinking cost you have thereby beneficed your unit with!

JA:  In yer dreams ...

JA:  Now, there are good reasons for proceeding further, that is,
     once the omnipresence of 3-adic relations in every analytic
     project is conceded, but perhaps it would be best for me to
     halt at this point and see if we have any form of agreement
     about this much, at least.

MW:  Personally I think we are discussing the wrong things.
     We are talking about representation of things, rather
     than what things are.

JA:  The day that we ascend to this direct, unmediated knowledge of being,
     is not a day that I think any of our sort will see this side of heaven.
     The only way that we "fallible and mortal finite information creatures"
     have to approach the One and the Universal is via the Many Appearances,
     by taking up as many different styles and types of representations as
     we can fathom, and then, by way of transformations on them, to distill
     what invariants, half concealing and half disclosing, they may manifest.

MW:  If we set the representation by relations of particular adacity
     aside, I think we would find much more to agree about.

JA:  Well, that is a heavenly notion.

JA:  The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the
     circumstance that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation
     from an element of one.

MW:  Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
     of what a relation is to me.  This would easily explain how we
     have been missing each other.

JA:  I will take up the task of that refinement at my next opportunity.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Thread 2

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  OK well let me first try to state a method,
     you will have to forgive some lack of formality,
     but it should not be so unclear what I mean.

JA:  If it can be formalized, I will help you to formalize it.

MW:  My optimism never ceases to amaze me!

JA:  Of course, I probably could have continued to continue my sequence
     of "moderately intelligent and well-informed guesses" (MIAWIG's),
     but I get a bit edgy doing that in a case like this, and in many
     cases, you see what happens -- people end up with a tangled web
     of deceptive impressions of understanding each other -- and so
     I have learned to distrust my openly operative optimiasm, too,
     when it gets down to the nitty-gritty of any semiotic process.

MW:  Where I come from this method would be
     informally known as reification.

JA:  Gasp!

MW:  Purpose:

     To take any n-adic relation occurence and turn it
     into n binary relations without loss of meaning.

JA:  I did not notice on my first parse that you use this
     phrase "n-adic relation occurrence" here, too, right
     at the outset.  I guess that the first time I read
     it I took it as "an example of an n-adic relation",
     and not as "an n-tuple in an n-adic relation".
     Which do you mean it to be?

MW:  Method:

     Create an object (say x) that stands
     for the n-adic relation as a whole.

JA:  Is x what we would call a "relation name"?
     It is the phrase "stands for" that makes
     me think this.  If not, why not just say
     that x is an n-adic relation?  When you
     say "relation as a whole" do you mean
     a set of n-tuples?  If so, can we then
     say that x is a set of n-tuples?

MW:  x replaces the tuple rather than a relation.
     So x replaces &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;.

     This does not mean that x = &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;

     there is a relationship, but it is one of
     derivability rather than equality.

JA:  The words "derive" and "derivability" are dear technical terms for me,
     though it is true they are terms of art in at least three arts I know.
     So unless you can define yet another new meaning for them for me, or
     else relate their sense to you to some of those that I already know,
     I am afraid that we are back to square one, if a little off base.
     Personally, I had the impression, though it might be illusory,
     of course, of having understood you better when you used the
     phrase "Create an object (say x) that 'stands for' the n-adic
     relation as a whole", since "stands for" is something that
     I can assimilate as "denotes", "represents", or "signifies",
     though, of course, when you go on to say "n-adic relation"
     later on in this very same pharse, I no longer know with
     any certainty whether you do indeed mean what I would mean
     if I were to say "n-adic relation" or whether you mean instead
     what I would mean if I said "n-adic relation instance" or just
     plain "n-tuple".  In ordinary speech I would, of course, allow
     for a certain amount of poetic license, but you know where that
     will land us, booted clean out of this republic of disambiguity,
     and in any case, even such as I see the need for being extremely
     careful, here, at the very underpinnings of ontological security.

MW:  Take each each element in the relation occurance

JA:  Is what you call a "relation occurrence"
     the same thing as a "relation instance",
     that is, an n-tuple?  Or is it the x?

MW:  The relation occurence is a tuple,
     an element is the thing in a place in a tuple.
     So &lt;element1, element2, ...&gt;

JA:  Okay, I sometimes speak this way, too, when I am speaking loosely,
     but that is not right at this moment, and so let me recommend the
     usage of the term "component", which is a fair "stand-up-onym",
     standardly understood on several continents and in not a few
     widely practiced disciplines, instead of this "element", which,
     as a keyword, will lead many astrayingly to think of that more
     straighforwardly set-theoretic "elementhood" or "membership"
     relation.

MW:  and create a relation between it and x.

JA:  Okay, I am guessing then that "relation occurrence" means "n-tuple".

MW:  Yes.

JA:  So far, so good.

JA:  But then what do you mean by "each element in the relation occurrence"?
     Do you mean "each component of the n-tuple"?

MW:  Sounds right -- see above.

JA:  Check, at least, until our licenses are revoked.

JA:  I am stuck at this point, and will need to wait for clarification.

JA:  To sum it up so far, let us see where we stand at present.

JA:  1.  We will need to be brutally clear, in future,
         as to when we are talking about n-tuples, and
         when we are talking about sets of n-tuples.

         For instance, a phrase like "relation as a whole",
         will, I'll bet, lead most folks who speak of such
         things to think of the "whole relation", which is
         broadly (extensionally) understood to be a set of
         tuples, or deeply (intensionally) comprehended as
         a property (intension) that all such tuples share.

JA:  2.  I am thoroughly mystified by your use of terms
         like "derivability", "replaces", &amp; "stands for"
         to describe the relation between x and a tuple,
         or else possibly between x and a set of tuples?

JA:  If you can clear up this little bit of underbrush,
     I think that we may be poised to venture into the
     interior.

Thanks In Prospect,

Jon Awbrey

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~RESIDUE~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  Use the role that the element plays
     in the original relation to name
     this binary relation.

| Example:
|
| (&lt;=&gt; (gives John Mary Book1)
|      (and (gives x)
|           (giver John)
|           (receiver Mary)
|           (given book1)
|      )
| )

MW:  (probably flakey, but I hope intelligible.)

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~EUDISER~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

MW:  I continue the struggle through the mists of ambiguity --
     hopefully towards you rather than away.

MW:  I think I am going to start again, trying to adopt
     some of the things you have suggested.

MW:  Purpose:

MW:  To take what is represented by an n-ary relation,
     and represent it by n binary relations and
     a set/class of objects.

MW:  Method:  [Notation slightly modified]

MW:  For each tuple 

     &lt;component1, component2, ...&gt;

     that is a member of the n-ary relation (L) create exactly
     one object (e) that is a member of the set of objects (E).

JA:  Just for the sake of concreteness as I attempt to follow along,
     let me try this method out on one or two of the above examples.

Relation L(&amp;) = {&lt;x, y, z&gt; in B^3 : x &amp; y = z}.

o-----o-----o---------o
|  x  |  y  | z = x&amp;y |
o-----o-----o---------o
|  0  |  0  |    0    |
|  0  |  1  |    0    |
|  1  |  0  |    0    |
|  1  |  1  |    1    |
o-----o-----o---------o

JA:  So, for each tuple &lt;x, y, z&gt; in L(&amp;)
     create exactly one object e in set E.

     E  =  {e&lt;0&gt;, e&lt;1&gt;, e&lt;2&gt;, e&lt;3}.

JA:  Hmmm, you know what, why don't we get really clever and
     use a binary index for the e's?  You like binary doncha?

     E  =  {e&lt;00&gt;, e&lt;01&gt;, e&lt;10&gt;, e&lt;11&gt;}.

JA:  Okay ... but this is beginning to look slightly familiar.
     It's like one of those days my Daddy told me about, when
     some bright-eyed new, bushy-tailed young whipper-snapper
     comes around and says to my Boss, "But hey, you old Dogs,
     I can do the whole darn thing in just one column!", next
     thing you know it is you who are that downsized stranger!

JA:  But we may as well go through with the rest of the exercise --
     what else do we have to do with all of this time on our hands?
     Ah, the trials, triebulations, and vicissitudes of redundancy!
     But, of course, "Redundancy Is The Essence Of Information".

JA:  What's next?

MW:  For each component of the tuple create a binary tuple
     that is a member of a relation that indicates the place
     in the original tuple that the component stands in,
     e.g.

     place1 &lt;e, component1&gt;

JA:  I will revert to my custom here and employ the
     standard-use-onyms of "coordinate projections".

     Proj&lt;1&gt;(e) = x.
     Proj&lt;2&gt;(e) = y.
     Proj&lt;3&gt;(e) = z.

MW:  e.g. if I have:

     (gives1 John Mary Book1)

MW:  If I apply the above method I might get:

     (gives2 e)
     (giver-in John e)
     (receiver-in Mary e)
     (given-in Book1 e)

JA:  To be honest, I worry a little about this rendition,
     but I shall render under unto KIFer what is KIFer's.
     As it stands, I do not know what it's trying to say.
     Is there supposed to be some sort of equivalence?
     I do not see that "(gives2 e)" is at all simpler.
     I have trouble understanding how the materials that
     you have assembled here are supposed to do anything
     at all but restate an application of the relation
     in a different font, as it were.
