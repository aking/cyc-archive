Dear Jon,

&gt; Short answer:  To the extent that a concrete syntax for FOL 
&gt; is built on
&gt; the foundation of a concrete syntax for ZOL, and to the 
&gt; extent that the
&gt; underlying concrete foundation is poured from the 
&gt; conglomerate mixer of
&gt; PABloid logic, the entire superstructure of the logical 
&gt; edifice that is
&gt; erected on this site will continue to rest -- if you can call 
&gt; that rest --
&gt; on the fault lines of a radically undermind neural plate 
&gt; architectonics.
&gt; Furthermore, the PABlematic foundation presents a practical 
&gt; obstacle to
&gt; constructing several other very useful, almost indispensable 
&gt; extensions
&gt; to the basic infrastructure of ZOL, like the differential 
&gt; extension and
&gt; the higher order propositional extension, which latter 
&gt; affords the mind
&gt; with novel views on the vistas of a generalized 
&gt; quantificational logic.

MW: This boils down to FOL not being foundational enough for
you, i.e. there is other stuff that it rests on.

&gt; 
&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; Finally got to the end of it.
&gt; 
&gt; JA = Jon Awbrey
&gt; JS = Jim Schoening
&gt; MW = Matthew West
&gt; 
&gt; JA: In answering your questions below, I will shift back
&gt;     to the larger arena, and address the properties of all
&gt;     FONAI (families of notation and implementation) that take
&gt;     as the generators of their ensuing generations the logical
&gt;     ligaments that are commonly denoted by means of ligatures like
&gt;     {&quot;~&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;=&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;, ...}.  Making up a nonce nomen just
&gt;     off the cusp of my head, let us call this soup the &quot;PentAlphaBet&quot;
&gt;     (PAB), and from this point on I will focus my critique, no more on
&gt;     poor innocent and utterly dependent epigone KIF, but on the much
&gt;     larger steaming kettle of PAB from whence this pot of message
&gt;     that we call &quot;KIF&quot; was initially dipped and incrementally
&gt;     spoon-fed to us.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: Furthermore, taking the &quot;whole systems&quot; approach, as the 
&gt; better half
&gt;     of my training has always taught me to do, I will not try 
&gt; to disjoin
&gt;     the questions of human conceptual and machine 
&gt; computational features
&gt;     in my analysis, but contemplate the whole impact of PAB 
&gt; or any FONAI
&gt;     on the whole chiasmatic system of &quot;computer-human 
&gt; interaction&quot; (CHI).
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I recall this now you mention it, but missed it in my summary
&gt;     of what I think you are about below.  I'd like to understand
&gt;     better why you think [PAB] is inadequate.  For example is it:
&gt; 
&gt; MW: 1.  [PAB] notation is obscure and difficult for humans
&gt;         to read and understand (but convenient for computers).
&gt; 
&gt; JA: No, not at first, of course.  It is, after all, &quot;quasi 
&gt; modo infantes&quot;,
&gt;     intended to be served up as &quot;comfort food&quot;, for the consumption of
&gt;     the &quot;artificial infant&quot; (AI) and the natural infant alike, and is
&gt;     thus especially well-formulated for those who are just beginning
&gt;     to learn, insipiently, to talk and to think in a logical fashion.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: But.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I have no way of estimating what your own logical 
&gt; information capacities are,
&gt;     and so I will merely confess what I discovered about my 
&gt; own at an early age,
&gt;     to wit, that when I tried to wean myself from 
&gt; propositional formulas whose
&gt;     complexion was comprised of slightly more than 7 ± 2 
&gt; boolean variables,
&gt;     I found myself already being confused by the diversity of 
&gt; evident and
&gt;     evidential truths that fused generically haplessly 
&gt; indistinctly into
&gt;     one another in my mind, and inundated my meagre aptitude to test
&gt;     their potential bearing on the question in front of my face.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: And so I had to turn to the e-mediacy of the e-lecturonic 
&gt; computer,
&gt;     much against my will and my heart's inspiration, I can 
&gt; tell you that,
&gt;     all in order to help myself out of the very many 
&gt; quandaries wherein
&gt;     I was inexorably, inexplicably, inextricably practically 
&gt; continually
&gt;     finding myself.  And no, PAB don't cut it one bit for a' that.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: In comparing, contrasting, discriminating, and evaluating 
&gt; various languages
&gt;     we naturally run into the questions of how, indeed, to 
&gt; justify each one and
&gt;     to judge among them.  Given that the types of languages 
&gt; we are talking about
&gt;     here are finitely generated artificial instruments, it is 
&gt; evident that there
&gt;     can be no such thing as &quot;the uniquely perfect linguistic 
&gt; equipment&quot; (TUPLE)
&gt;     for all intents and purposes that we might conceive to 
&gt; name, nor even for
&gt;     a fixed purpose and a given season under heaven.  But it 
&gt; is just as clear
&gt;     that, given a purpose, different languages will serve it 
&gt; better or worse.
&gt;     And the better that we are able to describe our object 
&gt; and to define our
&gt;     purpose, the better that we are able to discern among the 
&gt; many available
&gt;     candidates for the executive, the interpretive, and the 
&gt; legislative forms
&gt;     of languages and media that might conceivably enable us 
&gt; all to realize it.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: An expansive spectrum of evolving inquiry radiates from 
&gt; this single point,
&gt;     and I can sparely do more than dimly foreshadow a few 
&gt; higher lights of it.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: 2.  [PAB] is an asciification of First Order Logic, and FOL
&gt;         is inadequate to the task at hand (if so please explain
&gt;         why and what is needed).
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I have nothing very extraordinary to offer regarding FOL 
&gt; in the abstract.
&gt;     The method that's in it has its limits, the limits that 
&gt; make it a method.
&gt;     It has its uses in spite of, or due to, its disciplined 
&gt; reserves of scope.
&gt;     What matters is only knowing what these limits, scopes, 
&gt; and utilities are.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: From my first work in &quot;computer assisted proof&quot; (CAP)
&gt;     and &quot;propositional equation reasoning systems&quot; (PERS)
&gt;     I found that it is of critical importance to sort out
&gt;     the propositional, quantificational, relational facets
&gt;     of these tasks.  This has led me to look at the series
&gt;     of &quot;orders&quot;, ZOL, FOL, SOL, TOL -- and there is reason
&gt;     to believe that one would never need anything more than
&gt;     these four, if indeed that many, orders or &quot;intens/tions&quot; 
&gt;     of logic -- in a slightly, okay, maybe radically different
&gt;     way than the perspectives that you are likely to have gained
&gt;     wot of.  But that is a long and winding story, for another day.
&gt; 
&gt; Short answer:  To the extent that a concrete syntax for FOL 
&gt; is built on
&gt; the foundation of a concrete syntax for ZOL, and to the 
&gt; extent that the
&gt; underlying concrete foundation is poured from the 
&gt; conglomerate mixer of
&gt; PABloid logic, the entire superstructure of the logical 
&gt; edifice that is
&gt; erected on this site will continue to rest -- if you can call 
&gt; that rest --
&gt; on the fault lines of a radically undermind neural plate 
&gt; architectonics.
&gt; Furthermore, the PABlematic foundation presents a practical 
&gt; obstacle to
&gt; constructing several other very useful, almost indispensable 
&gt; extensions
&gt; to the basic infrastructure of ZOL, like the differential 
&gt; extension and
&gt; the higher order propositional extension, which latter 
&gt; affords the mind
&gt; with novel views on the vistas of a generalized 
&gt; quantificational logic.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: 3.  [PAB] does not give adequate support
&gt;         for semiotics (or some other key theory).
&gt; 
&gt; Let me just try to stress what I have frequently tried to say,
&gt; that a person who views the scene of inquiry from the outlook
&gt; a pragmatic theory of sign relations, or a pragmatic semiotic,
&gt; will regard deductive logic as a very small part of the logic
&gt; of inquiry as an integrated whole, and will regard the entire
&gt; business of logic, its normative mainstay and its descriptive
&gt; sideshow thrown in together just for good measure, as a minor
&gt; if very special part of what all semiotics has for its domain.
&gt; In sum, I use semiotics as an instrument for examining logics.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: For myself, I don't like KIF, but I think I can live with it.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: People learn to live with many things.
&gt; 
&gt; But those who do not study the story of Nazi and Soviet and 
&gt; Taliban history
&gt; are doomed to repeat it.  It all begins with infinitesimal, 
&gt; incre-mental,
&gt; inconspicuous, innocuous, all too e-noxious abuses of power.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: The question is whether we can think
&gt;     of a better tool for the task at hand.
&gt;     I already have.  This is not arrogance.
&gt;     The ground was broken, and the groundwork
&gt;     laid by Peirce long ago -- Existential Graphs
&gt;     and Conceptual Graphs are in the same ballpark --
&gt;     I have added a few improvements of my own that
&gt;     I happen to like and the utilities of which it
&gt;     is my job to demonstrate.  I will do this when
&gt;     and if I am ever given half a chance to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: We would be far better off just
&gt;     writing the standard out in plain
&gt;     math/logic monograph style. 
&gt; 
&gt; MW: I don't see how this helps interoperability between 
&gt; computer systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I will have to come back to this rather big question another time.
&gt; It falls under the heading of &quot;Transformations Of Discourse&quot;, but
&gt; I will have to go look for my former links to it, maybe tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: It is like the development, the initial definition, and the
&gt;     eventual formal specification of any programming language,
&gt;     say, Lisp or Pascal, just the last ones that I used a lot.
&gt;     Wirth's and McCarthy's standards began as plain papers in
&gt;     the usual computing science, logic, and mathematical styles.
&gt;     McCarthy continued to use his language of M-expressions as
&gt;     the definitive source and the medium of communication with
&gt;     himself, even when nobody else understood why it was needed,
&gt;     over and above the language of compu'terpri'able S-expressions
&gt;     that all the world knows as Lisp.  To me this is quite plain.
&gt;     He was, and still is, addressing the Ages.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I am definitely not saying that we should not seek a 
&gt; computationally
&gt;     implemented language.  Indeed, I would insist that we 
&gt; must at least
&gt;     develop the prototype &quot;test of concept&quot;, and usually many of them,
&gt;     in order to know if what we specify has a practical realization.
&gt;     Indeed, that may be the only useful thing that we can do here --
&gt;     and it would put the reductive examples of ontologies that we
&gt;     have been cudgeling our brains about in their proper light,
&gt;     namely, as little more than &quot;test data structures&quot; for
&gt;     the evaluation of the implicit, as yet vaporware,
&gt;     ontology maintainance software.  I know the
&gt;     &quot;receiver operating characteristocs&quot; of
&gt;     many of our prospective user groups,
&gt;     and I know that this is exactly how
&gt;     they would view our feeble SUO's, as
&gt;     just so many &quot;dumb textbook examples&quot;,
&gt;     of some use in paidagogy, nothing more.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: I am trying to help you with that problem, by delivering 
&gt; a new language
&gt;     to you that solves the fundamental problems in a 
&gt; fundamental way.  
&gt; 
&gt; MW: So is that the real purpose of your asciified notation?
&gt; 
&gt; No, the asciification is in direct response to a request from 
&gt; Chris Menzel.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: The basement is dug ...
&gt; 
&gt; MW: It being ...?
&gt; 
&gt; JA: My whole work in logic, graph theory, formal language theory,
&gt;     computer science, sign relational semiotics, systems theory,
&gt;     in sum, inquiry driven systems.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: You know it would be really handy to see the plans ...
&gt; 
&gt; JA: This is a what my dissertation is,
&gt;     a portion of which I am presently
&gt;     elaborating and expositing on the
&gt;     Ontology List.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: and the building of the next story is admittedly incomplete,
&gt;     but the fundamental medium is planned out right for what is
&gt;     probably the first time in history.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: But (assuming this is so) at present only in your head.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: No, I implemented the basic &quot;test of concept&quot; all through 
&gt; the 80's,
&gt;     a Pascal program that is entitled &quot;Theme One&quot;, and that I 
&gt; still use
&gt;     today as my main &quot;Propositional Calculator&quot; for any 
&gt; complex problem,
&gt;     and submitted it in partial fulfilment of the requirements for my
&gt;     Master's in Quantitative Psych at Michigan State 
&gt; University (1989).
&gt;     I then adopted this as the ground floor of my current PhD 
&gt; programme
&gt;     in Systems Engineering at Oakland University in Michigan, 
&gt; and I have
&gt;     been building on that basis with due diligence up until 
&gt; this moment.
&gt; 
&gt; JA: And now a few haunting refrains from the overture:
&gt; 
&gt; JA: 
<A  HREF="http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm">http://members.door.net/arisbe/menu/library/aboutcsp/awbrey/inquiry.htm</A>

JA: (The advertizing group has requested a #bold statement# for its copy.)

MW: Not the kind of summary of where you are going I had in mind.

JA: &quot;Where no one has gone before ...&quot;

JA: Bold statements make me weary -- I have will have to break here.

JA: Still having trouble getting past this point.

JS: If so, did he formally propose it to them and explain how it fits?
    If not, please explain its contribution.

MW: Jon's paper presents some foundations of logic which he thinks
    are important to set out as the basis for what is to follow.
    This is important, because as you will already have seen,
    logic, and some of the stuff immediately around it,
    is not as cut and dried as we might like to think.
    There are choices to be made, and these should
    be made explicitly.  As you may conclude
    from his exchange with CM, there is
    nothing earth-shattering here.

Well, do we really want to shatter the earth!?

MW: Jon's main contention that this is all leading to is that
    the &quot;big problem&quot; we really face is ontology development,
    rather than a specific ontology, and that we need amongst
    other things to specify and develop tools for this purpose.
    This would support an &quot;enquiry&quot; process which would support
    the interaction between ontology developers to help them
    resolve issues and move forwards.  He correctly identifies
    semiotics (for practical purpose the relationships between
    terms and meanings) as a key element in this.

MW: The main reason I am bothering to mediate here is that I have
    enough experience from my base standards community to know that
    he is right about these things. If we think we are going to create
    anything significant by hand coding KIF files, we don't understand
    the problem, but that is where we are right now.

JS: He is welcome to do his exploring on the Ontology list,
    but it doesn't belong on the SUO list.  If we met in person, 
    he wouldn't be permitted to do about a quarter of the talking
    on these types of topics.

And here I thought that's why we all got with the
Al Gore Rhythm of the Internet in the first place.
But the mind continues to run in the same old rut,
bound, indeed, gagged, by semio-antique metaphors
that are unfit to guide the course of e-discourse.
