Pat, thank you for your constructive and comprehensive reply below.  I
think I begin to see light, and I will try to summarize here rather than
embed comments.

1. In the context of the SUO you wish to use statements in a formal
language (e.g. KIF) and explanations using terms well defined in logic or
mathematics (e.g. relation).  You interpret these as talking about the
world, and see any layer of indirection as complexity.

2. I ( and maybe others like Graham Horn) rightly or wrongly feel it ought
to be possible to have a formal language and explanations which are easier
to understand and to easier to interpret than much of what we see written
by mathematicians as referring to the real world.

I now see more clearly why there are particular problems with the words
Relation and Relationship.  The mathematical term refers to, rightly from
the mathematical point of view, a very general and powerful concept which
can be used to represent a very wide range of things in the world.
Although Relationship can also be used in natural language in a very wide
variety of ways, its most frequent use is only a restricted sub-set of what
Relation can describe.  Furthermore, within IT, the word Relation is
strongly associated with what I believe is a correct but relatively limited
application of the mathematical concept propounded by Ted Codd, viz. the
use and manipulation of tables of constant surrogates (?grounded tuples).
Maybe this is more of a problem for IT professionals than ordinary English
speakers.

Bottom line is, if the development of the SUO, and perhaps more importantly
the use of the SUO, is going to extend to business people and IT
professionals who are unfamiliar with mathematical logic and its
vocabulary, there is serious risk of lack of understanding unless we are
very careful in our use of language.  I don't wish to outlaw terms which
may be useful, but plead for care in their use.  Meanwhile, I expect to
able to follow what you say, but may point out where those less familiar
than I with mathematical logic may have difficulty.

I will raise another potential hazard.  The way the word  Model is used in
mathematicians can appear to be the exact inverse of its natural language
meaning.  In natural language if I say A is a model of B, it is B that is
the real thing, the building, aircraft, or whatever.  I understand
mathematicians to refer to some reality as a model of the mathematical
theory.  I don't wish to spend time arguing this, but suggest noting the
risk.

Yours, Martin

P.S. The one specific comment on the discussion below is that I of course
recognize the relation between visible galaxies and invisible (and
unidentifed) stars can be represented by a KIF statement with variables,
though not with tables of surrogates.  In natural language I might call
that a rule rather than a relationship.

&gt;Dear Pat, may I try to increase our mutual understanding?

By all means. I will try to correspond in kind.

&gt;My overall comment is that I believe the scope of the SUO requires us to
&gt;relate it in some way or other to the real world, whatever that may be,
&gt;else how does it ever get to be useful.  If you don't like the way I am
&gt;trying to do it, do have any alternative proposal?

This is a topic on which I have had many long debates (with John
Sowa, among others), but I honestly do not think that we need to go
beyond Tarski, most of the time. That is, the usual, boring, familiar
mathematical model theory, which has been the 'standard' semantics
for logic now for over half a century and is astonishingly
well-understood, and is used throughout mathematics and formal logic
(and is the basis on which the metatheory of logic such as
completeness theorems, compactness theorems, etc., all rest), will do
just fine to be the basis for how to connect our representations to
the real world. This is not to say that it will solve all the
philosophical problems or even all the technical problems, but only
that it will serve as a perfectly functional theory as far as it
goes, and moreover that for most of what we have to do that will be
quite far enough. (The exceptions being perhaps where we need to
consider an explicit ontology of signs and relate or connect that
theory to our own logical language, if we ever get that far; and
perhaps, though I am more sanguine than many of my colleagues about
these problems, if we need to get deeply into questions of meaning in
natural language. I personally will be happy to go to my grave
without ever getting deeply involved in either of these topics, but
others may have a different agenda, of course.)

&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Pat, may I yet again suggest we can avoid a lot of problems if we are
&gt;clear
&gt; &gt;and consistent about whether we use any particular term to refer to the
&gt; &gt;real world or to a representation.
&gt;
&gt;By all means, but I wonder if you and I agree on quite what these
&gt;terms mean. I havn't been talking about representations at all;
&gt;relations are things in the semantics. (I do sometimes slip and
&gt;forget to say 'symbol' in 'relation symbol', mea culpa.)
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; I hope we could understand each other better if we could agree.  If I
&gt;suggest real world corresponds with Peirce's firstness, does this help you
&gt;understand what I mean?

Alas, no it does not. Let me confess to this list what many of my
friends already know, which is that I find Peirce's writings and
ideas about as opaque and unhelpful on these matters as, say, the
Kabbalah. I have absolutely no idea what 'Nthness' means, for any N,
and I wish, with the utmost sincerity and from the bottom of my
heart, that everyone who wishes to promote or prosleytise Peircian
numerological ideas would go away to an island somewhere, preferably
one without internet access.

(All of which, let me hasten to add, is not meant to in any way
denigrate the historical importance of this great and undeservedly
neglected American philosopher, who was so far in advance of his
brutish European contemporaries and whose reputation has been
maligned and distorted by an evil conspiracy - left or right wing, Im
not sure which - for so long. Much of his thinking has been unduly
neglected, including his brilliant, if flawed, metaphor between
logical variables and chemical valency - just imagine what Peirce
would have done with quantum electrodynamics! - and his remarkable
theory of the logical meaning of colors, among which he includes the
traditional heraldic classifications including gold, silver and
fox-fur. Now, can we get on with something more useful?)

&gt; If so, what would you call secondness or
&gt;thirdness?

I wouldn't. When we get to numerology, I will leave the room and go
find a bar somewhere.

&gt;It would also help me if you could clarify what you mean by
&gt;"things in the semantics"; in particular the semantics of what.

Well, of the language in which we propose to write the SUO. (Isn't
that what this is all about?) I tend to use KIF, but I don't have
strong views about it.

&gt; &gt;In particular I use the word relation only to refer to a representation
of
&gt; &gt;the real world, and in conformity with Ted Codd's definition.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; Perhaps I should have used two separate sentences here.  I did not
mean
&gt;Ted Codd defined relation to be a representation of the real world.  In
&gt;fact, he defined it much as you do below.  He (and I) then applied the
&gt;concept as a way of representing things.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not familiar with Ted Codd's work, but this isnt the sense in
&gt;which the term is used throughout mathematics and philosophy, and I'm
&gt;afraid that I would find it impossible to adapt to this usage.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; See above and below.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;As such, I
&gt; &gt;see no problem in it only being a table of surrogates.  Conversely I use
&gt; &gt;the word relationship only to refer to the thing in the real world made
up
&gt; &gt;of arbitrary entites.
&gt;
&gt;I am not sure quite what y'all consider to be "in the real world"
&gt;here. There is a very good sense in which the actual world consists
&gt;of nothing but stuff arranged in space and time, for example. Sorry
&gt;if I seem to be very academic and persnickety, but I tend to agree
&gt;with John Sowa that talk about what is 'real' is rather dangerous in
&gt;these contexts. I really do not know whether sets are 'real' in the
&gt;sense that, say, my desk is. They certainly arent *physically* real.
&gt;But I don't really care, either; my point about 'surrogates' is just
&gt;that sets can be sets of anything. The real things are the things in
&gt;the sets, not the sets themselves.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; It seems to me that the scope of the SUO requires us to relate it in
&gt;some way or other to the real world, whatever that may be, else how does
it
&gt;ever get to be useful.  If you don't like the way I am trying to do it, do
&gt;have any alternative proposal?

See above and end. Basically I don't think it is something that needs
to be done in any special way; I think it will come out in the wash,
as my grandmother used to say.

&gt; &gt;In my experience, every relationship in the real world of whatever
&gt; &gt;arbitrary entities can be adequately represented using one or more
&gt; &gt;relations with suitable surrogates in its columns.
&gt;
&gt;Well now, that is obviously wrong. There are certainly relations that
&gt;cannot be represented using tables of surrogates: for example, the
&gt;property of being an uncomputable number, or indeed *any* interesting
&gt;arithmetic relation (such as addition). But more concretely, consider
&gt;the fact that there are galaxies we can see but we cannot see any of
&gt;the stars in them, and consider the relation (in the real, real
&gt;world) of being a star in a galaxy. You can't adequately represent
&gt;that one with a table of surrogates since we havnt got any surrogates
&gt;for all those invisible stars.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; It all depends on how we define relationship (which you agree below is
&gt;not defined in mathematics in the way relation is).  If I have identified
a
&gt;particular star, and I have identified a particular galaxy, and I have
&gt;evidence that that star is in that galaxy, I call that an instance of a
&gt;relationship in the real world that I would like to represent in some way
&gt;in a model.

Sure. But what about if you havn't identified a particular star, and
moreover couldn't in principle? You might still want to say something
about the relation between stars and galaxies - for example, you
might want to say that every visible galaxy contains millions of
stars which are invisible (with the telescopes currently available).
That is a perfectly reasonable thing to be able to assert - it
happens to be true, and indeed is an important fact in any
understanding of astrophysics or astronomy. But it cannot be
represented as a fact about tables of surrogates.

The general point is that the sets of n-tuples which we want to allow
in our semantics will usually have to be a larger collection than the
sets of tables of surrogates which we could possibly store in a
database. We need to be able to say things about realities which we
could not possibly tabulate. Ontologies are more than just data
models for databases. They have to be able to talk about the world,
even those parts of it which can't be tabulated.

&gt; I believe asserting the existance of a tuple in a relation (or
&gt;adding a row to a table) is a good way to do this.  This may be useful
&gt;however many other stars, galaxies, and relationships between them may or
&gt;may not exist or be represented by other tuples.  I think your examples
&gt;(especially addition) are precisely why using the mathematical term
&gt;relation as if it were a synonym for relationship as used in natural
&gt;language to describe real world situations leads to high risk of
confusion.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Does this help?
&gt;
&gt;Er...I didnt feel like I needed any help on this particular topic. A
&gt;relation is a set of tuples. Relations have been sets of tuples since
&gt;I was an undergraduate math major, and they will go on being sets of
&gt;tuples. Its hard to think of anything clearer than that.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; Your definition of relation is the way Ted Codd used it and I agree
&gt;with. I am, and in this context I believe Ted Codd is, an applied
&gt;mathematician. That is, having some established mathematical results, we
&gt;seek to apply them to some real problem.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Incidently, while I agree that the word relation is well defined in
&gt; &gt;symbolic logic and relational databases, I am not aware of the same
being
&gt; &gt;true of the word relationship.
&gt;
&gt;No, it isn't, you are right. I will avoid using it for just that
&gt;reason, in fact.
&gt;
&gt;MK&gt; Please carry on preferring relation when what you are talking about is
&gt;the mathematical concept.  Please also consider if some different (and not
&gt;necessarily precisely defined) word like relationship is more appropriate
&gt;when you are trying to refer explicitly to things like stars, galaxies,
and
&gt;other observable phenomena.

No, I won't, because I profoundly disagree with your philosophical
assumptions here. Allow me to explain.

There is a widespread assumption about the 'meaning' of mathematics
which might be called 'naive platonism': the idea that mathematical
language is about a world of abstract mathematical 'things' which are
essentially different from the things in the real, physical world. On
this view, whenever we use 'formal' or mathematical concepts, we must
be referring to this abstract world, so therefore cannot be referring
to anything in the real world. To apply such mathematical talk to the
real world therefore, on this view, requires yet another interpretive
step to relate this abstract platonic world to the concerete,
physical, world.

Now, I think this view is just plain wrong. When I use mathematical
language to talk about the world (as for example when I say that a
piece of wood is ten inches long), I am actually talking about the
things in the world, not about abstractions that need to be somehow
related to the world by yet another theory of representations. As I
said in my comments (about a week ago) on Niles' revised upper
ontology, when a shepherd counts his sheep he isnt saying anything
about an abstract world of numbers: he is counting *sheep*.  When I
talk about sets of things, I mean exactly that: sets of *things*.
Things like sheep, for example. And this works even in more complex
areas of mathematics. Algebra texts often say things like 'an example
of the Klein group is provided by the rotations and flips of a
rectangular card'. This is couched in typical mathematician's
naive-platonist language ("the Klein group") , but what it really
means is that those (physical) rotations and flips of a (physical)
card provide a model - a valid interpretation - of the Klein group
axioms. Similarly, when I say that a relation is a set of n-tuples, I
do NOT mean to imply that a relation is some kind of ethereal
abstraction completely removed from the real, physical, world. It may
be - one can have relations on abstract things - but also might not
be, since one can also have relations - in exactly the same sense -
on concrete things. For example, consider the relation of owning.
Among the pairs in that set are the one containing me and a certain
Ford pickup truck (the grey one in the car park outside this
building.) I really do mean me, the physical person, and my physical
truck. Not datastructures or surrogates or entries in a table or
'mathematical objects', but  two real, physical things. (In case you
are going to ask: but is the *pair* a physical thing? I don't know,
and I don't care. I'm not making any ontological claims about the
pair, only about the things it pairs.)

So, to sum up, I will not use a different term for an 'abstract'
relation and a real, in-yer-actual-world relation(ship), because I
don't think these are fundamentally distinct. They are both sets of
n-tuples; the only difference is the physical character of the things
in those n-tuples. In brief: 'mathematical objects' may well contain
'things like stars, galaxies, and other observable phenomena'.

(And, I might add, that while we can argue about this until the cows
come home, this is the view that is embedded in the basic model
theory of virtually every logical language ever studied, so if SUO is
going to use any kind of extensional logic, then it had better either
adopt this view or get busy rewriting a large part of 20th century
formal logic. I would recommend the former, if only to get a head
start on the competition.)

I can see that if you don't accept this view, then you will have a
hard time following what I say. I'm not sure what to suggest to
alleviate this problem, but one strategy might be for you to take
everything I say with a grain of salt. I think I'm talking about the
real world, but you think (maybe) that I'm suffering from a delusion,
and that I'm really only talking about a kind of Platonic shadow of
the *real* real world.  If that is more or less right, then interpret
my position as that of being quite happy to be only talking about
shadows.
