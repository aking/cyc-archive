Dear Matthew, 
	.		Having looked at the reference, I am wondering how
can one get inside to look at the actual content of these standards. 

	.	That would give people like me a better appreciation of just
exactly what your approach is.

Dear Josiah (and I guess Niles),

Different people seem to notice at different times that perhaps methodology
might be important. So once again I will mention the work that we are doing
in ISO TC184/SC4 - industrial data, developing IIDEAS (Integration of
Industrial Data for Exchange Access and Sharing). 

After some 5 years of developing working papers, we eventually got to a base
document. This is currently being turned into a standard as ISO/TS 18876-1
"Architecture overview and description" and ISO/TS 18876-2 "Integration and
mapping methodology".

These are relatively high level, so they aim to be 3D/4D paradigm
independent, and language independent (e.g. entity relationship/ logic based
language independent) but they are a start.

You can find the latest Working Drafts at:

&gt; Subject: SUO: SUO Best Practices
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; JOHN SOWA WROTE:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Developing the tools and methodologies for extending, refining,
&gt; &gt; and sharing ontologies are just as important, and perhaps even
&gt; &gt; more important than any particular choice of categories we may
&gt; &gt; develop or propose for the SUO.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; John Sowa's remark of a week ago (as well as Robert Kent's highly
&gt; elaborated endorsement of it, and the methodological unease that Pat
&gt; Hayes, Chris Partridge and others have expressed in explaining their
&gt; emphatic NO votes) perhaps makes it germane to raise again 
&gt; the issue of
&gt; "best practices"  that was deferred by the acting chair at an earlier
&gt; stage: 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there some existing or best practice that leads us to 
&gt; believe that an
&gt; integrator's approach to ontology building (as in 
&gt; Teknowledge's current
&gt; "merged" KIF artifact) will be productive?  What purposes, if 
&gt; any, have
&gt; been successfully served by such an approach at the upper level?  From
&gt; existing practice, what kind of institutional arrangements, 
&gt; competence and
&gt; resources are needed to support such an artifact?
&gt; 
&gt; The previous experience of the ad hoc ontologies standards 
&gt; group led very
&gt; early to distinguishing ontology merger from ontology 
&gt; alignment.  "Merger" 
&gt; was used to mean an authoritative combining of artifacts in terms of a
&gt; stipulated semantics.  Since merger of this kind requires an ongoing
&gt; Authority, which was beyond the resources of an ad hoc group, it was
&gt; explicitly rejected in favor of "alignment"-- grounded in a 
&gt; semi-automated
&gt; methodology that is made fully transparent to the user, who can then
&gt; resolve the inevitable "bow ties"  between ontologies constructed on
&gt; differing principles to serve differing (user-defined)  
&gt; purposes.  (In the
&gt; metadata community people speak of "crosswalks" or "field 
&gt; mapping" among
&gt; metadata sets developed on differing principles.) Nevertheless, it was
&gt; thought feasible to attempt an *example* of an upper level provided it
&gt; were labeled as a reference object and constructed in a 
&gt; transparent way
&gt; that enabled users to adapt it, extend it, or disable parts 
&gt; of it as they
&gt; saw fit-- and also to preserve the integrity of any sub-ontologies or
&gt; parallel ontologies with which it might be aligned. 
&gt; 
&gt; The intellectual investment in an alignment approach is of course
&gt; conceptually higher at the outset (it is an "academic" task 
&gt; for which the
&gt; current interpretation of IEEE procedures, disclosure norms 
&gt; and philosophy
&gt; of voluntarism fueled by 'material interest' would have required some
&gt; creative adaptation) but it offers a greater prospect of 
&gt; self-maintenance,
&gt; whereas the merger approach, if it is to be more than a 
&gt; glossary, appears
&gt; to require a stipulative 'semantics' maintained by an ongoing 
&gt; authority or
&gt; institution (currently Teknowledge) to respond to the 
&gt; inevitable anomalies
&gt; and criticisms and then to amend, extend and revise the ontology to
&gt; accommodate them.
&gt; 
&gt; We should ask ourselves once again whether there is some 
&gt; 'best practice'
&gt; upon which the current base document builds.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there some existing practices that support the 
&gt; Teknowledge approach at
&gt; the upper level? For what purposes are they adequate-- search, NLP
&gt; disambiguation, inference down to domain ontologies, decision support,
&gt; pedagogy (these being purposes mentioned in the SUO 
&gt; discussions thus far). 
&gt; What does the previous experience with this approach suggest about the
&gt; likely strengths and limits of a standard based on it?  What are the
&gt; institutional and financial prerequisites of developing and 
&gt; maintaining
&gt; such a standard?  Are these prerequisites likely to be 
&gt; satisfied by some
&gt; committed subgroup of the current discussants?
&gt; 
&gt; Until someone can root the activity in existing or best 
&gt; practice, and show
&gt; a movement towards settled norms, in what sense is it a standards
&gt; activity?
&gt; 
&gt; Lee
&gt; 
&gt;
