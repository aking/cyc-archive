Frank,

This is indeed helpful and illuminating.  SUO does need a fresh start, and
agreeing on ground rules is a good way to proceed. The important thing is
that the rules be known in advance to avoid misunderstanding. It is also
important that any adaptations be suited to the realities of the SUO
project as it has developed.

I agree with you that Jim's proposals hang together much better once one
accepts a quorum requirement for a minimal level of participation.  I am
happy to reread his provisions in that light (though I am quite sure from
prior discussions with him that his intended meaning was to eliminate a
threshold requirement altogether).

As a general matter, quorum requirements are designed to provide an
incentive to solicit active participation, to make reasonable allowance
for tabulation and notification problems, and to guard against domination
by a rump.  I am happy to substitute the term "minimal level of
participation" for quorum provided we all understand that a vote is not
valid unless a pre-published threshold of participation is achieved.  

We have just faced the quorum/participation issue in a very mild version
in the election of the chair, our first official vote.  The number of
votes in Paul Eastman's initial report of Jim's election fell one vote
below the 50% quorum level (23/47).  A second, restated report was
requested off-line to make reasonable allowance for excusably "late"
ballots (three came in a few hours after a deadline keyed to an unfamiliar
time zone, perhaps because of slow server queues) so that, on Paul's
second report, which was placed on-line, we reached 55% (26/47), a valid
result.

I would agree with you that some such threshold is needed in all future
official balloting and see nothing unworkable with 50% (currently 24
votes), given that it was exceeded on a pro forma uncontested vote.  A 20%
rule keyed to the minimal participation level for petitions to vote on
dissenting views seems reasonable, so that if we continue with the default
50% participation requirement, 5 votes is reasonable (it is about 20% of
50% of our total list); if we lower the quorum/participation threshold to
40%, a petition of four should prevail. (I and perhaps others would be
inclined to second any well-formulated proposal even if I disagreed with
it, to assure adequate attention to minority views.)  On the numbers,
Jim's proposal for a rule-of-five on petitions fits coherently with a 50%
participation threshold in a group of about 50. As you point out, the
whole purpose of tabulating abstentions is to keep a quorum involved, even
when members are uninformed and/or indifferent on some particular
question.  For SUO these figures-- 50% + a rule of five for resolutions--
seem much better suited to group-wide procedural resolutions than to
technical ones, because we have already embarked on a multi-track course
in which the full group involvement may be reserved for well worked
reports by subgroups.

Your numbered points on the Chairman and the Technical Editor strike me
as well worked out and rooted in best practices, and the observations on
the sensitivity required by of the Chair and Technical Editor to building
consensus are especially worthy of note.  However, the implicit model of a
group working on a single document is not really applicable if we have
already decided on smaller working groups, each with its own Technical
Editor, proceeding on perhaps three documents/approaches concurrently, and
possibly meeting face-to-face in committees of as few as three to
accelerate development.  Because Matthew West addresses this contingency
directly and has in addition targeted toward "Resolutions", the thread he
began seems to me move us well along the path to shaping resolutions.  To
take what I view as the best of your own and Jim's views we would resolve
that for group-wide balloting

    a) 50% participation of those eligible to vote be required for a
valid ballot;
    b) permissible votes be ......(e.g. yes, yes with comment, no, no with
comment, abstain);
    c) abstentions be counted for determining level of participation only;
    d) 20% of the minimal threshold for participation, rounded to the
nearest integer, be the minimal threshold for proposing resolutions.

On the rule of five for technical matters, I think we all agree that this
is unduly cumbersome in the negative for smaller technical sub-groups (as
a threshold for objections). In a small group a single objection based on
scientific merit will be accepted fairly harmoniously without email vote
tabulations.  And a single second should suffice to test sentiment in the
event of serious disagreement.

On the other hand a "positive" rule-of-five is one of several useful
reality tests before any document is accepted for work in a multi-track
system.  Am I correct in recalling that by house rules it takes five to
maintain a standard in its early years?  Thinking backwards from this
requirement, it seems a threshold test of realism that any document
accepted for working group status be subscribed to for comment and
maintenance over four years by five or more mutually independent members.
(Mutually independent means not coordinated by single sponsor.) This is
not an onerous rule, especially since members can subscribe to more than
one document.  Further tests of realism: that there be a technical editor
for each document, that there be funding and/or serious commitment of time
sufficient to produce a final result, that elementary conditions likely to
be required in a final approval process be built into the original design.
I am aware that the implementation of some of these tests as internal
guidelines for SUO will superadd conditions to the house rules, and think
that, as in the procedural matters above, this is both permissible and
desirable.

My personal thanks for bringing your knowledge to bear in giving the
SUO a fresh start.

&gt; &gt; Taken together these rules do not cohere, though in isolation each might
&gt; &gt; seem reasonable. For example, the proposed rule eliminating quorum
&gt; &gt; requirements entirely does not cohere with a high seconding requirement of
&gt; &gt; five votes to apply to even technical objections.  (We could in principle
&gt; &gt; have votes in which only four people participated counted as valid, while
&gt; &gt; four people would not suffice to object to the result).
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Lee-
&gt; 
&gt; At first glance, I had some similar thoughts.  However, I realized that all 
&gt; three are truly separate aspects (however, the "seconding" and "objecting" 
&gt; numbers should be the same, see below).
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; On the "quorum" issue ...
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that "quorum" is not a factor in E-mail (correspondence-based) 
&gt; consensus-building because there is no sense of "being present" (everyone is 
&gt; presumed to be continuously present ... yes, some people may be on vacation, 
&gt; but ballots are typically 30 days ... we would presume that a participant 
&gt; must access their E-mail at least once every 30 days).
&gt; 
&gt; In correspondence-based standards committee processes (which is pretty much 
&gt; how many standards committees operated for the 100 years up until the mid to 
&gt; late 1990's), there is some minimum requirement of *responses* to letter 
&gt; ballots (an E-mail ballot is, in effect, a letter ballot).  Typically, the 
&gt; requirement is 50% ... this is one of the cases where Abstains count: the 
&gt; number of responses is Yes + No + Abstain.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd recommend that we require a minimum number of responses to E-mail 
&gt; (letter) ballots, say 50%.  We shouldn't call this a "quorum" because
the 
&gt; term "quorum" can confuse people in this context.  We should call this 
&gt; something like "minimum number of ballot responses".
&gt; 
&gt; Using a "minimum number of ballot responses" serves the same purpose as a 
&gt; "quorum" in in-person meetings: it ensures that committee decisions were 
&gt; made by a "substantial" number of participants ("subtantial" might be 1/3, 
&gt; 40%, 50%, 2/3, 3/4 ... the choice is a matter of opinion, each with 
&gt; different strengths and weaknesses).  For RR00, a default "quorum" is a 
&gt; majority, i.e., &gt;50%, but organizations may agree upon different numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; On a second (third, fourth, or fifth) ...
&gt; 
&gt; In RROO (Robert's Rules of Order), the purpose of a second is minimize the 
&gt; amount frivolous discussion (in terms of formal committee deliberations ... 
&gt; we can have as much "frivolous" discussion as we like outside the formal 
&gt; deliberation on the E-mail reflector).  Choosing the right level of support 
&gt; (i.e., choosing a number like 2 in RROO, or choosing 5 as Jim suggested) is 
&gt; a matter of opinion.  I really believe that Jim is correct in assessing the 
&gt; large amount of administrative work (which includes all of us volunteers) in 
&gt; formal votes and, possibly, subsequent ballot resolution.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if 5 is the right number, but it sounds reasonable to me.  
&gt; Although a formula can make it more complex, I'd like the number 5 (or 
&gt; whatever it is) to shrink if the number of voting members shrinks.  The 
&gt; minimum should be 2.
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; On an objection to votes by acclimation (as Jim phrased it: "does anyone 
&gt; object to ..." for minor issues from the Chair and consensus-building for 
&gt; the Technical Editor) ...
&gt;  
&gt; I'd like to peel apart several aspects of Jim's suggestions.  First, the 
&gt; primary purpose of voting by acclamation is to speed the process when there 
&gt; is overwhelming agreement (see my excerpt of RROO at the end of this 
&gt; E-mail).  In in-person meetings, this can be determined by lots of nodding 
&gt; heads ... harder to determine in E-mail discussion.  I believe three things 
&gt; are necessary to make this work:
&gt; 
&gt;         1.  The Chair needs to get a good sense that there are no 
&gt; objections.  I can't give any hard and fast rules, but it just comes from 
&gt; experience.  Maybe the Chair can give a preliminary message like "I'm not 
&gt; hearing any objections to such and such and I'd like to get a vote by 
&gt; acclamation".  FYI, Paul (who just ran the Chair's election) made a 
&gt; reasonable assumption on voting by acclamation because there was no opposing 
&gt; candidate.  FYI2, SUO members, too, made a reasonable request to have a 
&gt; formal vote (see below).
&gt; 
&gt;         2.  Contentious issues should not be voted on by acclamation.
&gt; 
&gt;         3.  Participants should be reasonable in their objections to votes 
&gt; by acclamation.  In other words, don't just presume grand conspiricies and 
&gt; evil intentions ... this only adds ill will, frustration, and loss of 
&gt; valuable time.  A simple "I object to the vote by acclamation.  I'd rather 
&gt; have a formal vote." is all that is necessary.  This (collabration and 
&gt; consensus-building in *this* group) is a learning experience for all us ... 
&gt; it may take a while for the Chair and the participants to get the right 
&gt; sense of things.  If you have insights on how the Chair might have misread 
&gt; the committee, then send your suggestions to the Chair directly ... no need 
&gt; to tie up E-mail reflector bandwidth.
&gt; 
&gt; The second half of this is consensus-building for the Technical Editor.  The 
&gt; TE can use several strategies for improving the document.  However, the most 
&gt; important feature of the TE's work is that (1) he make changes based on 
&gt; direction from the group, (2) he use his judgement to make suggestions, and 
&gt; (3) his work requires approval (e.g., every new formal draft) from the 
&gt; group.  In other words, there are a good number of "controls" over the TE's 
&gt; work.  I wouldn't want to constrain the TE's work to the 5-person rule 
&gt; because even one person's objections might make sense (see the notion of 
&gt; "consensus" at the end of this E-mail).  The role of the TE is to make 
&gt; educated guesses about the consensus of the Working Group ... like the 
&gt; Chair, he may make some mistakes, but please give him some leeway ... we are 
&gt; all trying to do this electronically, so there may be some miscues.
&gt; 
&gt; In conclusion, the 5-person objection rule (or whatever the number) is 
&gt; primarily a tool to help speed the adminstrative and consensus-building 
&gt; aspects of the committee (the Chair) ... not a vehicle to rush things 
&gt; through.  The number for objections should be the same number for 
&gt; "seconding" because an objection causes a formal vote, just like "seconding" 
&gt; does.  As I said above, I don't recommend the 5-person minimum for the TE's 
&gt; work since there are regular, formal votes to approve new drafts.
&gt; 
&gt; -----------
&gt; &gt; Is there some e-mail template that has worked elsehwere ("a best
&gt; &gt; practice")  that we can adopt?
&gt; 
&gt; The suggestions above are based on best/existing practices from ISO, IEC, 
&gt; NCITS, and IEEE standards committees.
&gt; 
&gt; These suggestions on "quorum" (actually, participation level) are based on 
&gt; existing formal ballot rules for many standards committees (ISO/IEC, NCITS, 
&gt; IEEE).
&gt; 
&gt; The suggestions on "acclamation" for the Chair are based on RROO in the 
&gt; section on "Voting by General Consent".  Here's an excerpt (from "The New 
&gt; Robert's Rules of Order", Barnes and Noble pocket edition, ISBN 
&gt; 0-88029-972-X, pages 154-155):
&gt; 
&gt;         General Consent.  When the formality of motions and voting can be 
&gt; avoided in routine business and on questions of little importance, business 
&gt; can be handled with greater efficiency, the chair assuming general 
&gt; (unanimous) consent until someone objects.  General consent does not 
&gt; necessarily mean that every member is in facvor of the motion, but, knowing 
&gt; it is useless to oppose it or even to discuss it, the opposition simply 
&gt; acquiesces in the formality.  Thus, in the case of approving the minutes, 
&gt; the chair asks if there are any corrections.  If one is suggested, it is 
&gt; made.  When no correction is suggested, the chair says, "There being no 
&gt; corrections [or no further corrections] the minutes stand approved".  While 
&gt; routine and minor matters can be rapidly diposed of in this way, any time an 
&gt; objection is made promptly, the chair ignores what has been done even if he 
&gt; has announced the result, and requires a regular vote.
&gt; 
&gt; The suggestions on the TE's (using his judgement to assess objections, seek 
&gt; compromises, and build consensus) are the "common sense" one learns in that 
&gt; role ... as mentioned above, there are "controls" from the working group 
&gt; that make sure the WG gets what it wants ... the TE is an informed 
&gt; participant that helps with the editing tasks.  In ISO/IEC committees, as 
&gt; convener (a position similar to a Chair), one learns the "consensus" is the 
&gt; absence of sustained, substanial opposition ... that doesn't mean unanimous 
&gt; ... it's a judgement call.  The TE's need to have a sense of "consensus" to 
&gt; direct their work.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this helps.
