&gt; "YAP"?  Not sure about it ... I did not intend to write
&gt; that any "positive" ontology will ever come out all-armed
&gt; from the process I propose.  It's not even in a corner of
&gt; my mind -- except maybe in some weird dreaming remote one ...
&gt; So I suppose I have to go deeper in what I am really about.

All punning aside, I was really just trying to make a logical point,
about the necessary underpinnings that we pick for our propositional
primitives, that is to say, if we wish the web to become an extension --
and I guess that while we're wishing we should make it an augmentation --
of our own intelligence, such as it is.  Yes, there is a tiny bit of
a nuance or a nuisance of stuff about the "Dialectic of Enlightenment"
and the "Dimmer Side of Positivism" in the mix, too, but that will
keep till later, I trust.

&gt; I'm tracking the moves of vultures to try and find out where the corpses lie
&gt; in the desert.  Or maybe I'm more interested in the vultures moves themselves
&gt; than by the stinking carrions they gather around.  In the topic map community
&gt; these days, people are hypnotized by a metaphysical question:  a topic is a
&gt; system representation of a subject ... but what is a subject?  The approach
&gt; I am pushing here and there is that a subject is a gathering of vultures,
&gt; about a carrion that is generally so much rotten and with so many birds
&gt; around that it is no more possible to identify it.  And that much of the
&gt; time you would find nothing there more than this gathering, because the
&gt; first vulture to home there was misleading or blind and the others made
&gt; the mistake to trust its indication.

There is this competition among vultures.
The way Aristotle tells it, that is what
drives them from 'Topics' to 'Analytics'.

&gt; So what I'm interested in is the geography of vultures gathering points.
&gt; And for that I claim we can be positive and see this geography from the sky above.
&gt; The clustering algorithms will never ever let us discover any absolute "core concepts"
&gt; and even less "core relationships" -- that is "why" the vultures are there.  But maybe
&gt; they will help us to target and focus on those binding points we tacitly agree to
&gt; gather around.  What lies at these points we'll not identify in a positive way,
&gt; nor why those points are linked the way they are.  I fully agree that *whatever*
&gt; is focusing conversation around those points is best defined as "nor-neither".
&gt; And going to "fundamental" is always cutting off rather than putting more,
&gt; I could not agree more about that.
&gt; 
&gt; To build a fundamental tool for this "more and more" civilization
&gt; out of a "nor-neither" vacuity-driven approach would be a delightful
&gt; paradox indeed ... But I digress ...

The culture of vultures is neither autonomous nor self-contained.
They are not ourobourgeois enough, not yet, to satisfy their own
appetites feeding off of each other's leftovers -- something has
to come in from outside their hermeneutically sealed-off-culture.
But this entails the risk that their cultivated conventions will
uplode like balloons when peirced with a bit of real cosmopolity.

But we can talk of that,
all in good time, later.
