Change &amp; Time SIG:

This thread has grown so cold and so old that I will
need to append a little bit of a self-quotation just
in order to recall at all what I was doing last time:

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~PREVIOUS~MATERIAL~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

| The present is big with the future.
|
| ~~ Leibniz

Parties Interested in Change and Time,
I see no way to separate these issues:

Here is a more straightforward explanation
of what I think it means to try exploiting
the following analogy:

Logic : Ontology  ::  Mathematics : Physics

The tiny part of Logic that I have in mind here
can be suggested by naming the types of domains
that constitute its various realms of interest,
namely, spaces like B = {0, 1}, B^k, (B^k -&gt; B),
and a few others to be named later.

The tiny part of Mathematics that I have in mind
can be suggested by the analogous collection of
spaces over the real domain, R, R^k, (R^k -&gt; R),
and a few others to be named later.

Now suppose that we approach the problems of dynamics
in the following way, just marking as stepping-stones
for now the increasingly complex and special types of
spaces that we need to contemplate as we take on this
problem of building formal models for changing worlds.

The "path of refinement of spaces" (POROS) that
one typically travels can be pictured like this:

             B

     o       o
     |       |
     |       |
     |       |
 Add Axioms  v
     |       |
     |       |
     |       |
     v       v
     o       o------------------&gt;o------------------&gt;o------------------&gt;o

             R                   R^k                (R^k)x(dR^k)

                                 R^k -&gt; R           (R^k)x(dR^k) -&gt; R

     ^                           R -&gt; R^k            R -&gt; (R^k)x(dR^k)
     |
     o--&gt;    o------------------&gt;o--Add-Structures--&gt;o------------------&gt;o

Imagine that you start with a single logical distinction that you are capable
of drawing in your universe of discourse, in other words a single qualitative
attribute that you can use to divide everything within your survey into those
things that have it &amp; those things that do not:  one circle in a venn diagram.

All distinctions being abstractly the same, let us code any arbitrary
one of them by means of the elements in the boolean space B = {0, 1}.

Now suppose that you keep becoming more and more discerning
and more amd more discriminating in your perceptions of the
world and again in your corresponding classifications of it,
and let us say that this whole panoply of distinctions just
happens to be correlated with one another in a way that can
be described by a certain set of axioms, the wages of which
we would all know to be a depiction of the real number line,
the long and the short of it known as no other line but "R".

Given this R, there are all sorts of mathematical spaces
that we usually construct out of it, either just for fun
or in our earnest seeking for structures that form icons
of stuff and such that happens to exist and to transpire
from moment to moment within that so-called "real" world.

For instance:

1.  The k-dimensional real space R^k.
2.  The space of real-valued functions on R^k, namely, (R^k -&gt; R).
3.  The space of curves, orbits, paths in R^k, namely, (R -&gt; R^k).

This much we think of as more or less a matter of "analytic geometry",
useful for describing all sorts of more or less static situations and
all the things that by and large keep still and stay put in the world.

In order to describe the sorts of situations that are pregnant with
change and diversity, we need to extend this analytic geometry into
the realms of differential and integral calculus.  An easy way that
we can schematize this general type of extension, sufficient to our
present level of sketchily schematic and glossily thematic overview,
is to pretend that it is only a matter of annexing a new complement
of "differential dimensions" to those that we already know, in this
case yielding the product spaces that we can depict as (R^k)x(dR^k),
with all of the "potential hills" ((R^k)x(dR^k) -&gt; R) that might be
heaped upon them, and all of the "trajectories" (R -&gt; (R^k)x(dR^k))
that one may chance or choose to use to wend one's way through them.

Okay, that's way too much work for the end of the week --
I will pause with that much and pick up again later on --

Have a good weekend,

Jon Awbrey

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~LAIRETAM~SUOIVERP~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

All right now, that was the way that it was taught to me
when I was passing through the field of mathematics back
in the early 1980's and intermittently from time to time
thereafter.  You spend what seems like an awful eternity
straining and stretching your mind to fall along the one
dimentia of that real number line, tacking on the axioms
one by one, step by step, grind by grind, slowly in turn,
till at long last you have finally qualified yourself as
'The One-Dimensional Man', not to be sexist about it but
truly to recall the exact title of the book of that name.
And then, after you had trained your mind so narrowly in
a single solitary direction that your intellect would be
all but invisible if seen on end, well, then it would be
time to execute the "turn" toward greater dimentionality,
sup-structure after inf-structure being tacked onto that
sub-structure already taken for granted, else for proven!

Ah Such Good Times!
Glad They Are Gone!

There is another road, much less taken --
Okay, so nobody's been along it before!
Cept me, just a ways, so far as I know --
Instead of down and right on the chart,
You go right and down on the map above.

What I would like to suggest here is that we contemplate
another way of developing the mathematical formalisms and
the mathematical models that we deploy toward the analysis
and the understanding of complex dynamic actions and systems.

Instead of initially fixing on the static situation, and refining
our descriptive formalisms all the way from their most rudimentary
qualitative approximations to their most subtle quantitative styles,
and only then turning to the requirement of "turning the dynamics on",
let us try to imagine what it would be like to "turn on the dynamics"
right from the earliest phases of qualitative description, almost as
if you were to begin with simple universes of discourse, for example,
as depicted in venn diagrams with one, two, three circles, no more,
at first, and then to set the clock in motion, watching all of the
elements in these simple universes going through their paces in
their one-, two-, three-ring circuses, only gradually refining
both the statics and the kinetics together toward full-fledged
pictures of the conceivable dynamics.

This is tantamount to taking the "alternate path of refinement"
on the diagram that I will repeat once again and amplify below:

             B                   B^k                (B^k)x(dB^k)

                                 B^k -&gt; B           (B^k)x(dB^k) -&gt; B

                                 B -&gt; B^k            B -&gt; (B^k)x(dB^k)

     o       o------------------&gt;o------------------&gt;o------------------&gt;o
     |       |                                                           |
     |       |                                                           |
     |       |                                                           |
 Add Axioms  v                                                           v
     |       |                                                           |
     |       |                                                           |
     |       |                                                           |
     v       v                                                           v
     o       o------------------&gt;o------------------&gt;o------------------&gt;o

             R                   R^k                (R^k)x(dR^k)

                                 R^k -&gt; R           (R^k)x(dR^k) -&gt; R

     ^                           R -&gt; R^k            R -&gt; (R^k)x(dR^k)
     |
     o--&gt;    o------------------&gt;o--Add-Structures--&gt;o------------------&gt;o

Okay, that's enough for this week.
I will see y'all on the flip side!
