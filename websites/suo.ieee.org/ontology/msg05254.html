Topic :&gt; Architecture For Inquiry :&gt; Discussion 1

o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o

Jack,

Enough about football ...

And please excuse a few subject line experiments,
as I seem to have exhausted my supply of acronyms,
and find myself forced to restructure my thoughts
according to -- what shall I call them -- topics?

Also, I am just coming off a bad cold, so I hope
what I say here isn't just the Tylenol^TM talking.

But you have gone and reminded me of some more stuff that
I was thinking a lot about in the early 80's and then again
in the early 90's, so maybe it's one of those sunspot things.

I was thinking of Grossberg's competition/cooperation models.
It's a very cold memory, so I will leave it at that for now,
and hope that I remember more tomorrow.

I will say that I have always been wildly ambivalent about
so-called &quot;connectionist&quot; models, partly because the term
itself is so ambiguous.  On the one hand I like the idea
that &quot;it's in the connections&quot;.  On the other hand, the
full strength of that idea is hardly ever explored in
the models that one commonly sees, which are limited
mostly to linear transforms, algebraically speaking,
and 2-adic junctures, graph-theoretically speaking,
and you know that just won't cut it, or splice it,
from a Peircean point of view.

Enough for now.  Hope my head is clearer tomorrow.

Jon Awbrey

&gt; I am reposting here a stream of messages circulated between Jon Awbrey 
&gt; and myself. Jon thinks, and I agree, that a larger audience may look at 
&gt; what we are looking at and see things we haven't seen. That would be a 
&gt; useful outcome. Herewith, reorganized in sequence, are some bits of the 
&gt; conversation. In theory, our intent is to continue the discussion in 
&gt; this forum, unless, of course, we get booed off stage.
&gt; 
&gt; 2004 is shaping up quite nicely!
&gt; Jack
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;jp&gt;
&gt; There are folks creating a &quot;language&quot; for the description of topic maps.
&gt; I think they are on a track that could represent a contribution to
&gt; architectures of inquiry and have been dogging it, them, and
&gt; implementations of prototypes for quite a while now.
&gt; Their latest effort is found at
&gt; 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmrm/TMRM-3.10/TMRM-3.10.html">http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmrm/TMRM-3.10/TMRM-3.10.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; One of the designers, Patrick Durusau, is now suggesting that Z:
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/~mike/zrm/zrm.pdf">http://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/~mike/zrm/zrm.pdf</A>
&gt;
&gt; would be a good description language in which to do that work.
&gt; &lt;/jp&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;ja&gt;
&gt; generally speaking, there are getting to be so many new languages
&gt; every week that i don't think there's much hope keeping up with
&gt; them unless we start finding better ways of teaching them to
&gt; each other, and i am not seeing that happen, even on the
&gt; far horizon.  you find me in the middle of my return to
&gt; english, which has been a struggle for a dozen years
&gt; now, after a decade of thinking in pascal, that is
&gt; not spoke all that much anymore.  as a practical
&gt; matter, it does not look like i will get either
&gt; the time or energy to learn another artifact
&gt; of that sort.  i will probably stick to the
&gt; basics of logic and math language, though
&gt; of a peircean bent, from here on out.
&gt; of course, there are few innovations
&gt; of syntax that would facilitate
&gt; matters greatly, but we can't
&gt; let the course of inquiry be
&gt; impeded by the lack of
&gt; a perfect language.
&gt; &lt;/ja&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;jp&gt;
&gt; I hear you.
&gt; Nevertheless, I am profoundly locked in a dance with destiny which is 
&gt; guided by an underlying thesis that there must be a way to program my 
&gt; computer such that it will augment my own intellect. To do that, I am 
&gt; stuck examining all the artifacts I can find, looking, always, for the 
&gt; &quot;perfect&quot; match to the task I have posed. Along the way, I have discovered
&gt;  inference engines which reason both forwards and backwards
&gt;  Eurisko-like evolutionary programming methodologies
&gt;  qualitative reasoning
&gt;  dialog mapping and IBIS structures
&gt;  neural net (analog and digital) representations
&gt;  semantic net representations
&gt;  category theory, Rosen, Raschevsky, etc
&gt;  Peirce
&gt;
&gt; Somewhere in there lies the seeds of an architectural implementation, 
&gt; one most likely guided by the diagrams you are now drawing, but 
&gt; somewhere in there, motivated by desires sparked more by Rosen than by 
&gt; anyone else; I fully subscribe to Raschevsky's notion that we have yet 
&gt; to invent a representation scheme which allows us to discover and 
&gt; understand that which constitutes life iself.  Along the way, I have 
&gt; discovered quantum entanglement, and I have posited that *it* is the 
&gt; *thing* we disentangle when we tease open living cells, whereupon they 
&gt; die and from which we are completely unable to reconstruct them.
&gt; 
&gt; I am to understand that there is a group of people, perhaps driven by 
&gt; Chris Langton (not sure on that) who think they are on the verge of 
&gt; actually constructing a living cell from scratch. If they succeed, then, 
&gt; so much for my quantum entanglement thesis. I'm personally betting that 
&gt; they will not succeed, simply on the strength of words by Raschevsky and 
&gt; Rosen.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time, I am most interested in teasing structures of 
&gt; understanding, grist for your architecture, out of the spoken and 
&gt; written word.  My friend Patrick Durusau sent this URL along this morning:
&gt;
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ivs/journal/v2/n1/full/9500037a.html">http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ivs/journal/v2/n1/full/9500037a.html</A> 
&gt; 
&gt; Food for thought in there.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, we can analyze hell out of every word down to Peirces triads. Sure 
&gt; we can construct commutative graphs ala Rosen. But, in the end, where do 
&gt; you go with those?  One of the grand problems I had with all the 
&gt; discussions going on in the Mikulecky letters [ 
&gt; <A  HREF="http://www.vcu.edu/complex/">http://www.vcu.edu/complex/</A> ] was that nobody was able to take Rosen's 
&gt; 10C-6 and &quot;fill in the blanks.&quot;
&gt; [10C-6 is the commutative diagram that is Rosen's &quot;canonical organism&quot;, 
&gt; a metabolism-repair diagram which, when drawn, elicits reproduction for 
&gt; free, found in his book _Life Itself_] Nobody seems to know what to do 
&gt; with a basic MR diagram. Does anybody know what to do with Peirce's triads?
&gt; 
&gt; I think we are a loooooong way from wherever it is we want to be.
&gt; &lt;/jp&gt;
