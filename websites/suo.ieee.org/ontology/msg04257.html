&gt; Subj:  Building Ontologies Through Signs And Inquiries (BOTSAI)
&gt; Date:  Sat, 27 Oct 2001 20:20:01 -0400

&gt;   To:  Grande Divine Semio Comedy &lt;gdsemiocom@univ-perp.fr&gt;,

&gt; 
&gt; Expectation, Satisfaction, Disappointment
&gt; 
&gt; o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o~~~~~~~~~o
&gt; 
&gt; Compare &amp; Contrast:
&gt; 
&gt; Exhibit 1
&gt; 
&gt; | Reasoning and Expectation
&gt; |
&gt; | But since you propose to study logic, you have more or less faith
&gt; | in reasoning, as affording knowledge of the truth.  Now reasoning
&gt; | is a very different thing indeed from the percept, or even from
&gt; | perceptual facts.  For reasoning is essentially a voluntary act,
&gt; | over which we exercise control.  If it were not so, logic would
&gt; | be of no use at all.  For logic is, in the main, criticism of
&gt; | reasoning as good or bad.  Now it is idle so to criticize
&gt; | an operation which is beyond all control, correction,
&gt; | or improvement.  (CP 2.144).
&gt; |
&gt; | You have, therefore, to inquire, first, in what sense you have
&gt; | any faith in reasoning, seeing that its conclusions cannot in
&gt; | the least resemble the percepts, upon which alone implicit
&gt; | reliance is warranted.  Conclusions of reasoning can little
&gt; | resemble even the 'perceptual facts'.  For besides being
&gt; | involuntary, these latter are strictly memories of what
&gt; | has taken place in the recent past, while all conclusions
&gt; | of reasoning partake of the general nature of expectations
&gt; | of the future.  What two things can be more disparate than
&gt; | a memory and an expectation?  (CP 2.145).
&gt; |
&gt; | ...
&gt; |
&gt; | The second branch of the question, when you have decided in what
&gt; | your faith in reasoning consists, will inquire just what it is
&gt; | that justifies that faith.  The stimulation of doubt about things
&gt; | indubitable or not really doubted is no more wholesome than is
&gt; | any other humbug;  yet the precise specification of the evidence
&gt; | for an undoubted truth often in logic throws a brilliant light
&gt; | in one direction or in another, now pointing to a corrected
&gt; | formulation of the proposition, now to a better comprehension
&gt; | of its relations to other truths, again to some valuable
&gt; | distinctions, etc.  (CP 2.147).
&gt; |
&gt; | As to the former branch of this question, it will be found
&gt; | upon consideration that it is precisely the analogy of an
&gt; | inferential conclusion to an expectation which furnishes the
&gt; | key to the matter.  An expectation is a habit of imagining.
&gt; | A habit is not an affection of consciousness;  it is a general
&gt; | law of action, such that on a certain general kind of occasion
&gt; | a man will be more or less apt to act in a certain general way.
&gt; | An imagination is an affection of consciousness which can be
&gt; | directly compared with a percept in some special feature, and
&gt; | be pronounced to accord or disaccord with it.  Suppose for
&gt; | example that I slip a cent into a slot, and expect on pulling
&gt; | a knob to see a little cake of chocolate appear.  My expectation
&gt; | consists in, or at least involves, such a habit that when I think
&gt; | of pulling the knob, I imagine I see a chocolate coming into view.
&gt; | When the perceptual chocolate comes into view, my imagination of it
&gt; | is a feeling of such a nature that the percept can be compared with
&gt; | it as to size, shape, the nature of the wrapper, the color, taste,
&gt; | flavor, hardness and grain of what is within.  Of course, every
&gt; | expectation is a matter of inference.  What an inference is we
&gt; | shall soon see more exactly than we need just now to consider.
&gt; | For our present purpose it is sufficient to say that the
&gt; | inferential process involves the formation of a habit.
&gt; | For it produces a belief, or opinion;  and a genuine
&gt; | belief, or opinion, is something on which a man is
&gt; | prepared to act, and is therefore, in a general sense,
&gt; | a habit.  A belief need not be conscious.  (CP 2.148).
&gt; |
&gt; | Charles Sanders Peirce, 'Collected Papers', CP 2.144-148.
&gt; 
&gt; Exhibit 2
&gt; 
&gt; | The Experience of Satisfaction
&gt; |
&gt; | The filling of the nuclear neurones in Psi has as its
&gt; | consequence an effort to discharge, an impetus which is
&gt; | released along motor pathways.  Experience shows that the
&gt; | first path to be followed is that leading to 'internal change'
&gt; | (e.g., emotional expression, screaming, or vascular innervation).
&gt; | But, as we showed at the beginning of the discussion, no discharge
&gt; | of this kind can bring about any relief of tension, because endogenous
&gt; | stimuli continue to be received in spite of it and the Psi-tension is
&gt; | re-established.  Here a removal of the stimulus can only be effected
&gt; | by an intervention which will temporarily stop the release of quantity
&gt; | (Q-eta) in the interior of the body, and an intervention of this kind
&gt; | requires an alteration in the external world (e.g., the supply of
&gt; | nourishment or the proximity of the sexual object), and this, as
&gt; | a &quot;specific action&quot;, can only be brought about in particular ways.
&gt; | At early stages the human organism is incapable of achieving this
&gt; | specific action.  It is brought about by extraneous help, when the
&gt; | attention of an experienced person has been drawn to the child's
&gt; | condition by a discharge taking place along the path of internal
&gt; | change [e.g., by the child's screaming].  This path of discharge
&gt; | thus acquires an extremely important secondary function -- viz.,
&gt; | of bringing about an understanding with other people;  and the
&gt; | original helplessness of human beings is thus the primal source
&gt; | of all moral motives.
&gt; |
&gt; | When the extraneous helper has carried out the specific action in
&gt; | the external world on behalf of the helpless subject, the latter
&gt; | is in a position, by means of reflex contrivances, immediately
&gt; | to perform what is necessary in the interior of his body in
&gt; | order to remove the endogenous stimulus.  This total event
&gt; | then constitutes an &quot;experience of satisfaction&quot;, which
&gt; | has the most momentous consequences in the functional
&gt; | development of the individual.
&gt; |
&gt; | ...
&gt; |
&gt; | Thus the experience of satisfaction leads to a facilitation between
&gt; | the two memory-images [of the object wished-for and of the reflex
&gt; | movement] and the nuclear neurones which had been cathected during
&gt; | the state of urgency.  (No doubt, during [the actual course of]
&gt; | the discharge brought about by the satisfaction, the quantity
&gt; | (Q-eta) flows out of the memory-images as well.)  Now, when
&gt; | the state of urgency or wishing re-appears, the cathexis
&gt; | will pass also to the two memories and will activate
&gt; | 'them'.  And in all probability the memory-image of
&gt; | the object will be the first to experience this
&gt; | wishful activation.
&gt; |
&gt; | I have no doubt that the wishful activation will in the first
&gt; | instance produce something similar to a perception -- namely,
&gt; | a hallucination.  And if this leads to the performance of the
&gt; | reflex action, disappointment will inevitably follow.
