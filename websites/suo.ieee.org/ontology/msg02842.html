¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Jim,

Thank for clarifying the issue of language restrictions.

Allow me to explain why I reflexively echoed your off-list communiques
back to the list.  I will try to make the explanation as brief as I can,
but it has a somewhat long history behind it, and so I will have to ask
you and the rest of the group for all of your several forebearances.

Since my very first day in the SUO Forum I have been subjected
to a wide variety of off-list harassment, insult, intimidation,
and other forms of manipulative communication.  These have been
directed at everything from the fact that I initially sent HTML,
to the borders that I was using to keep track of who was saying
what in a long polylogue, to the occasional acronym, neologism,
bit of doggerel, or classical gas, to the length of some of my
sentences, to the sources that I painstakingly cited for the
benefit of my reader, to just about every accident of style
that I can name, but seldom, if ever, perhaps on but one
single finger of a handful of occasions did any of these
critical notes ever address a question of substance.

As a person who once had a couple of courses in psychology,
I was able to recognize most of this behavior as falling
under the nomen of "displacement", whereby a person who
is discontented with the content of what is being said,
but who cannot or will not criticize it on the grounds
of its substance, for then the critic would be forced
to back up the criticism with reasoned counterpoints,
chooses instead to attack all sorts of straw bearings,
any sort of bearing but the one that really causes
the wheel to squeak.  Moreover, being a person who
has been kicked around the block one or twice or
thrice in my life, I am very well acquainted with
this "sort of person" (SOP) who likes to thump you
with a well-directed cue, from somewhere off-scene,
just to see how you will subsequently careen around
the table, for the evident amusement of all players --
all players save one.  So I have dealt with all that
as best I could from occasion to occasion, sometimes
less well than others.  But I ask myself, and these
are the questions that really worry me:  What if I
am not the only one? -- Delightful as it may be to
be see oneself as the uniquely so-graced martyr! --
But what of the other Innocents, who may feel, with
an automatic sense of "abused isolation" (AI), that
they have no other option but to do as I myself all
too often would have done at a much less bruised --
but also, by way of that form of compensation that
comes in the guise of its due insulation -- a much
less scarred age, and that is just to slink away in
a silent state of mystification and bewildered despair?
So I count myself lucky that all of this happened to me
from the very beginning of my time as a jouster on the
SUO Lists -- otherwise, I fear that I may have been
tempted to think that it was something I said,
something specifically about me.

Now, none of this has anything to do with you, Jim,
but it may serve as a preliminary to my explanation.

I recognize the inconvenience that it may cause your person,
in this degree become public and no longer private, but you
have taken on the burden of it through your own free choice.
In your role as Chairperson of an Open Working Group, I can
see no way that you expect to be accorded the same "rights",
if that is what these "liberties" may be called, to engage
in off-list intimidation, manipulation, and the selective
application of ad hoc and newly but not duly constituted
"rules", at least, not with the same immunity and impunity
that other members of the group currently exercise, indeed,
in every sense of the word, appear to "enjoy" them.

In this connection, I applaud your recent expressions of
concern with regard to the civility of these proceedings,
but the tone has been set into the stone of our cultural
foundations a long time ago, and so it may take a bit of
elbow grace to alter it in any fundamental way.  A grace,
by the way, that will scarcely be coaxed out of thin air
through the sacrifice of this or that goat to your cause.
Thus, until this conversion to a higher form of chivalry
has become the general cause, and not joust a convenient
excuse for selective interventions on the behalf of some
hidden agenda or ulterior motive, I don't see how anyone
can observe it except askance, and with a wry observance.

Thank you for your attention,

Jon Awbrey

&gt; All,
&gt; 
&gt; Let me clarify.  There are no language restrictions on this list.
&gt; Only if there were a problem would we need to address such an issue.
&gt; 
&gt; This topic stems from my attempts to work privately with Jon Awbrey
&gt; regarding his volume and relevancy of postings.  (Jon posts my private
&gt; emails, so I'm posting this directly.)  After I had put him on notice, he
&gt; posted something in a foreign language.  I asked him privately to not post
&gt; things in languages other than English.  He forwarded this to the list and
&gt; JCC must have sent Jon a message asking this quesiton.  Thus the confusion.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jon, I understand your position but I don't see how you can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particularize your model to individual and collective semiosis
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and enquiry if all references to a mind, perception, feeling,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience etc. are considered accidental, unessential, ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I am looking at the issue from much too near a distance
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but from where you stand, even with binoculars, it could be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you are missing the details?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jean-Marc,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You and I have scattered the words like stars across the stygian void:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accident, collection, detail, distance, essence, incident, individual,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inquiry, particular, position, semiosis, substance, an even dozen lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of categories to rival the starry-eyed if not the gods.  Do we really
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grasp their meaning, or does their reach exceed our charts and graphs?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what of their bearing on the earth below, and how are they kin to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pluralities of affects, experiences, feelings, hearts, minds, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; senses that we bear?  Do you actually imagine that I would cleave the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wonder of this beautiful child, that I'll once and forever be, in two?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guess again, and again, and still again, for your birth gives you the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right to cast the guesses like stars into the skies of one brief life.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fare Thee Well,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
