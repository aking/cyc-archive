&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  "Matthew"  is a sign that denotes Matthew   (in the real world).
&gt; &gt;  "x"        is a sign that denotes x         (in the real world).
&gt; &gt;  "&lt;x, y&gt;"   is a sign that denotes &lt;x, y&gt;    (in the real world).
&gt; &gt;  "R"        is a sign that denotes {&lt;x, y&gt; : &lt;x, y&gt; in R} (ITRW).
&gt; &gt; '"Matthew"' is a sign that denotes "Matthew" (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; '"x"'       is a sign that denotes "x"       (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; '"&lt;x, y&gt;"'  is a sign that denotes "&lt;x, y&gt;"  (in the real world).
&gt; &gt; '"R"'       is a sign that denotes '"R"'     (in the real world).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There's a pattern here.

&gt; MW:  Yes, there is a pattern in the examples you have given,

&gt; a pattern of the sort:
&gt; 
&gt; "&lt;x, y&gt;"               denotes x in the real world or
&gt; "&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes a in the real world
&gt; 
&gt; It is perhaps worth remembering that this discussion
&gt; started with Graham saying that activities WERE relations,
&gt; where as I was saying that we sometimes represented activities
&gt; as relations, where the relation really contains a number of things

Dear Matthew,

I do want to be taken as trying to zing you on account of some zing
that somebody else did to me  -- I always really hate it, myself,
when somebody does that to me -- but what you said merely went
to remind me of a rather old and tiresome problem, one that
I wish that we all could get past, and I feel like I have
already contributed my darnedest bit of yarn to trying
to untangle it -- all to such little aveil, alas! --
and perhaps the antic frustrations of not being
able to rend this "antic issue" (AI) a toile
that would one day be of the "said &amp; done"
variety and all of the kindred ambivalent
"sanguinity" bled through just a bit into
bloody irony, but I simply wish that we
could see through it all -- I tried to
give the Inquistive my scope on the
objects of our earnest attention,
but none are so blinkered by the
orbs of their vision as those
who tremble before imaginary
daimons, the ones that they
imagine inhabit the scopes,
never seeing 'tis the eyes
that habit what they see.

But let me try to focus on what you say now:

&gt; MW:  Yes, there is a pattern in the examples you have given,
&gt; but it does not always hold.  It is quite common to see
&gt; a pattern of the sort:
&gt; 
&gt; "&lt;x, y&gt;"               denotes x in the real world or
&gt; "&lt;a, b, c, d, e, f&gt;"   denotes a in the real world

I do not think that I would call it "quite common to see",
and although I believe that I may have run across a few
expressions that appear, from a certain angle, distance,
or perspective to look roughly or superfically similar
to these, I tend to suspect that the people who write
them -- I cannot guarantee that it was not me, too! --
are just being careless, or casual, or loose in their
canon, that probably they meant to write something else,
and that the job of reflection on expressions is to help
them -- or help myself, as the case may be! -- to untangle
their sense and, as Bobby Burns say, "to mend their ways".
 
&gt; It is perhaps worth remembering that this discussion
&gt; started with Graham saying that activities WERE relations,
&gt; where as I was saying that we sometimes represented activities
&gt; as relations, where the relation really contains a number of things
&gt; the activity is related to, including perhaps a reference to itself,
&gt; but not other representation, which is not quite the same.

But, really, I cannot be responsible for the ways that other people talk!
I can talk till I am truly "blue of face" (BOF), but, without the purple
tinge of authority, who under heaven would listen up to my scarlet prose?

I can think that I see a way to untangle this --
I can send pages and pages to the purpose --
but that is said and done, and so am I --
to that I am resigned --
hic et nunc --
anyway ...

Many Regards,

Jon Awbrey
