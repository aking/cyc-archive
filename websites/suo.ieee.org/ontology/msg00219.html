Douglas,
   You make a good point about needing general concepts in the SUO.  While 
river source might be a little too specific, we certainly need 
graph-theoretic notions to support codifying concepts like rivers, 
plumbing, roads and traffic, electrical systems etc.
   Would anyone be willing to make a start on this area?  We need fleshed 
out concepts like

node
path
juncture
flow
source
sink
rate
etc

&gt;I agree that a very significant effort is before us, and one that promises
&gt;significant and far-reaching repercussions.  I suspect that's why most of
&gt;us are enthusiastic about participating in such an endeavor.
&gt;
&gt;I would like to add a thought based on your example.  The effort to
&gt;discover the source of the Amazon may be a good metaphor for the magnitude
&gt;of our effort.  However, I think it also directly raises some ontological
&gt;considerations.  By that I mean, the very concept of "source" - of the
&gt;Amazon or any other river.  Isn't it true that this is a general concept
&gt;that could be defined and used in a number of applications?  Isn't it
&gt;likely that the source of the Amazon could be defined using the same set of
&gt;considerations as the source of the Nile, or the source of the Mississippi?
&gt;OF course the geographical particulars would be unique in each case, but
&gt;mightn't we expect a general consideration such as  "the peak or ridge that
&gt;is the farthest distance from the mouth of the river and that still allows
&gt;water to eventually drain into the river in question"?  I'm just making
&gt;this up for purposes of illustration, to raise the question of whether such
&gt;a term as river source would not be a valid consideration for ontology?
&gt;
&gt;Then, the further question arises, should river source be a valid
&gt;consideration for what we define as "upper ontology"?  Or would this be
&gt;confined to one or more lower level geographical, geological, and or
&gt;geo-political ontologies?  Is there some set of meaning components from an
&gt;upper ontology that would help organize the concepts in such more specific
&gt;ontologies?  Isn't this what we are talking about?

&gt;Subject:  SUO: A typical definition
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A major purpose of the SUO is to establish a foundation for sharing,
&gt;reusing, and calibrating the ontologies of independently developed
&gt;systems that need to interoperate.
&gt;
&gt;A precise, formal notation, such as KIF, is necessary for stating
&gt;the definitions and axioms.  But long before we get to the stage
&gt;where we can begin writing anything formal, it is necessary to
&gt;negotiate (usually in a natural language) what we need to formalize.
&gt;
&gt;As an example of the problems involved, I would like to cite the
&gt;recent story about the discovery of the source of the Amazon River:
&gt;
&gt;   <A  HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_1071000/1071838.stm</A>
&gt;
&gt;The Amazon River has been known to western explorers for nearly
&gt;500 years, but its source was not discovered until 1971, and all the
&gt;controversies had not been resolved until now.  Following are the
&gt;kinds of options that the explorers had to consider:
&gt;
&gt;    Smithsonian Institution geographer Andrew Johnson said the source
&gt;    of the Amazon could be defined as the most distant point in the
&gt;    drainage basin from which surface water ran year round, or the
&gt;    furthest point from which water could possibly flow to the Atlantic.
&gt;    "The Nevado Mismi fits both of these definitions," said Johnson.
&gt;
&gt;Note that people have been talking about the Amazon and "its source"
&gt;for centuries before they had a clear idea of the definition of "its
&gt;source" or the actual referent of that term.  Yet people have been
&gt;able to talk effectively about those undefinited and unknown entities,
&gt;discuss alternate definitions, and plan expeditions to search for
&gt;the actual referents -- all without having a clear idea of what they
&gt;were looking for.
&gt;
&gt;The following quotation from the above article gives some idea of
&gt;the size of a typical expedition:
&gt;
&gt;    The NGS team included 22 members from the United States, Poland,
&gt;    Peru, Canada and Spain. They moved by foot, Jeep, bicycle and
&gt;    horseback to explore the five remote Andean rivers that combine
&gt;    to form the Amazon - the Apurimac, Huallaga, Mantaro, Maranion
&gt;    and Urubamba-Vilcanota.
&gt;
&gt;Observation:  This level of effort is necessary to define nearly every
&gt;term in the ontology, ranging from the most general terms at the top
&gt;down to the referents of what Russell called "definite descriptions"
&gt;such as "the source of the Amazon".
&gt;
&gt;I wanted to mention this example for two reasons:  The first is that
&gt;we are undertaking a very large task -- a point that has been noted
&gt;on this list many times from different perspectives.  The second is
&gt;that before any formal axioms can be written, a great deal of informal
&gt;analysis, study, discussion, negotation, and often very arduous and
&gt;back-breaking work must be done to determine exactly what is to be
&gt;formalized.
