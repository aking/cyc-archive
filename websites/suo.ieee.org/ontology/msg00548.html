Hi All,

	I am considering making three major changes to the version of the
merged ontology document that I sent out on January 12th, and I would like
to solicit comments.  The proposed changes are as follows.

1.  Simplify the tip of the ontology so that it has the following structure.

(subclass-of Individual Entity)
(subclass-of Relation Entity)
(subclass-of Physical Entity)
(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)

(subclass-of Object Physical)
(subclass-of Object Continuant)
(subclass-of Process Physical)
(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
(subclass-of Schema Abstract)
(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
(subclass-of Script Abstract)
(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
(subclass-of Structure Relation)
(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
(subclass-of Situation Relation)
(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)

For reference, the original upper-level class hierarchy, as proposed by John
Sowa, is as follows.

;;(subclass-of Independent Entity)
;;(subclass-of Relative Entity)
;;(subclass-of Mediating Entity)
;;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
;;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
;;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
;;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)

;;(subclass-of Actuality Independent)
;;(subclass-of Actuality Physical)
;;(subclass-of Form Independent)
;;(subclass-of Form Abstract)
;;(subclass-of Prehension Physical)
;;(subclass-of Prehension Relative)
;;(subclass-of Proposition Relative)
;;(subclass-of Proposition Abstract)
;;(subclass-of Nexus Physical)
;;(subclass-of Nexus Mediating)
;;(subclass-of Intention Abstract)
;;(subclass-of Intention Mediating)

;;(subclass-of Object Actuality)
;;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
;;(subclass-of Process Actuality)
;;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
;;(subclass-of Schema Form)
;;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
;;(subclass-of Script Form)
;;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
;;(subclass-of Juncture Prehension)
;;(subclass-of Juncture Continuant)
;;(subclass-of Participation Prehension)
;;(subclass-of Participation Occurrent)
;;(subclass-of Description Proposition)
;;(subclass-of Description Continuant)
;;(subclass-of History Proposition)
;;(subclass-of History Occurrent)
;;(subclass-of Structure Nexus)
;;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
;;(subclass-of Situation Nexus)
;;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
;;(subclass-of Reason Intention)
;;(subclass-of Reason Continuant)
;;(subclass-of Purpose Intention)
;;(subclass-of Purpose Occurrent)

2.  Recast the docu-strings for the high-level concepts in non-philosophical
language (so that their meaning is clear to engineers without a
philosophical background).  The revised docu-strings follow.

(documentation Abstract "Pure information as distinguished from any
particular encoding of the information in a physical medium.  Instances of
Abstract can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects such
as sets and relations, but they cannot exist at a particular place and time
without some physical encoding or embodiment.")

(documentation Arrangement "Mathematical structures that do not have spatial
dimensions: numbers, sets, lists, algebras, grammars, and the data
structures of computer science.  All the syntactic forms in natural
languages, programming languages, and versions of symbolic logic are
included under Arrangement.")

(documentation Assembly "A CorpuscularObject whose discrete parts are
completely separable. Whether something is considered an unstructured
collection or a structured assembly depends on some agent's intention.  A
car in working order is a highly structured assembly.  But if the parts were
disassembled and spread out on some surface, it would be called a
collection.  Yet if the parts were arranged to spell the word 'CAR', they
would again form an assembly, although not one that could be used for
transportation. Conversely, if a car were towed to the junk yard, the junk
dealer might consider it a collection, even though the parts were in the
same order they had been in while it was running.")

(documentation Attribute "Primitive schemas, i.e. schemas that cannot be
defined in terms of other schemas.  Some examples are:  colors, tastes,
intensities, etc.")

(documentation CaseRole "The class of predicates relating the spatially
distinguished parts of an occurrent. Case roles include the agent, patient
or recipient of an action, the flammable substance in a burning process, or
the water that falls in rain.")

(documentation ComponentRelation "An umbrella class for any binary relation
that relates an Object to an aspect of that object.  The three elements of
ComponentRelation are part-of, property-of, and stage-of.")

(documentation Continuant "A continuant is an entity whose identity
continues to be recognizable over some extended interval of time.")

(documentation ContinuousObject "An entity that is indefinitely divisible to
the limits of perception by the available sense organs or measuring
instruments.")

(documentation ContinuousProcess "A process in which incremental changes
take place continuously.  This is the normal kind of physical process.")

(documentation CorpuscularObject "An Object that has separable parts.")

(documentation DiscreteProcess "In a discrete process, which is typical of
computer programs or idealized approximations to physical processes, changes
occur in discrete steps called events, which are interleaved with periods of
inactivity called states.")

(documentation Entity "The universal class of individuals.  This is the root
node of the ontology.")

(documentation HomogeneousObject "A ContinuousObject in which every part is
similar to every other in every relevant respect, e.g., temperature,
chemical constitution, density, etc.  An example would be a beaker of pure
distilled water in a controlled environment.")

(documentation Individual "An entity that can be characterized independently
of any relationships it may have to other entities.")

(documentation KineticForm "Includes the information in a reel of motion
picture film or the patterns and equations for generating motion in virtual
reality.")

(documentation Object "A Physical Continuant which retains its identity over
some interval of time. Although no physical entity is ever permanent, an
object can have stable properties over its lifespan. The type Object
includes ordinary physical objects as well as the instantiations of classes
in object-oriented programming languages.")

(documentation Occurrent "An entity that does not have a stable identity
during any interval of time. Formally, Occurrent satisfies the following
conditions:
   * The temporal parts of an occurrent exist at different times.
   * The spatial parts of an occurrent may exist at the same time, but an
occurrent may have 	different spatial parts at different times
   * There are no identity conditions that can be used to identify two
occurrents that are 	observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions.
A person's lifetime, for example, is an occurrent. Different stages of a
life cannot be reliably identified unless some continuant, such as the
person's fingerprints or DNA, is recognized by suitable identity conditions
at each stage. Even then, the identification depends on an inference that
presupposes the uniqueness of the identity conditions.")

(documentation OrganicObject "A CorpuscularObject such as a tree or flower
that has parts that are not completely separable, even though there are
discontinuities.")

(documentation Physical "An entity that has a location in space-time.")

(documentation Procedure "Any time- or sequence-dependent specification of
actions and events: including: computer programs, finite-state machines,
Petri nets, robot commands, cooking recipes, musical scores, conference
schedules, driving directions, and the scripts of actions and dialog in
plays and movies. Although a script is intended to represent a dynamic
process, it may have static parts.  In a movie film, for example, the
sequence of images is a script that determines the motion, but each frame is
a schema of a static image.")

(documentation Process "A Physical Occurrent during the interval of
interest. Depending on the time scale and level of detail, the same actual
entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic process. Even an entity
as stable as a diamond could be considered a process when viewed over a long
time period or at the atomic level of vibrating particles.")

(documentation Proposition "A subclass of Assembly. In logic, the assertion
of a proposition is a claim that the abstraction corresponds to some aspect
or configuration of the entity or entities involved. As an example, the
statement cat(Yojo) expresses a proposition that Cat characterizes the
entity named Yojo.")

(documentation Relation "An entity in a relationship to some other entity.")

(documentation Schema "An Abstract form that has the structure of a
Continuant and, thus, does not specify time or timelike relationships.
Examples include geometric forms, the syntactic structures of sentences in
some language, or the encodings of pictures in a multimedia system.")

(documentation Script "An Abstract form that has the structure of an
Occurrent and, thus, represents time sequences. Examples include computer
programs, a recipe for baking a cake, a sheet of music to be played on a
piano, or a differential equation that governs the evolution of a physical
process. A movie can be described by several different kinds of scripts: the
first is a specification of the actions and dialog to be acted out by
humans; but the sequence of frames in a reel of film is also a script that
determines a process carried out by a projector that generates flickering
images on a screen.")

(documentation Sign "A Sign is considered as representing something to some
agent.")

(documentation Situation "A Relational entity considered as an Occurrent. A
situation relates the participants in some process, whose stages may involve
different participants at different times.")

(documentation Structure "A Relational entity considered as a Continuant. A
structure relates multiple objects whose connections constitute the
structure.")

(documentation VariableObject "A ContinuousObject that nonetheless varies
in, e.g., temperature, chemical constitution, density, etc.  An example
would be a large body of water such as the ocean.")

3.  The third proposed change is to eliminate the axioms of the "Theory of
Holes".  As I see it, these axioms are very interesting, but they are also
controversial and probably more relevant in a philosophical context than an
engineering one like the SUO.
