SUOphists,

It occurs to me that the note I sent to Jim yesterday,
to re-say what I tried to essay the other day on the
initial knot of this thread, might just be of use
to others who happen to be wondering about that.

¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤~~~~~~~~~¤

Jim,

I guess I am trying to say that a bunch people sitting around
trying to blue-sky an ontology, even if they do a whole lot
of library work on what's gone before, which does not seem
to be the inclination of a lot of the people in the group,
are not going to get much further than our ancestors got.
About the only thing we have going for us that's new is
all of our software resources, which are still pretty
primitive but could be sharpened, but the way that we
are currently thinking about using the software that
we have got is almost completely backwards.  We need
more work on the analysis front-end, before we ever
get to the inference and packaging stages of things.
And since this analysis task is the bottleneck at
the present time, we ought to putting much more
thought into how to acquire or create software
support for that end of things, rather than
trying to haggle this out by hand the way
that all of our forebears were forced to
do it, and did it about as good as they
or we could be expected to if that was
the only means that there was to use.

I have done some very low-level work on this,
and learned a few rudimentary things about it,
but nobody is going to get excited about the
basement level of grunt work that has really
got to be done sooner or later, not so long
as they keep on thinking in this "word magic"
mode that by naming things they will acquire
dominion over them.  I've been saying this
all along, but it just ain't catchy enough.

The generic rule that I learned in school is:
If a task is too hard then we ought to think
about how to write programs to help us do it.
The job that we are tackling now is too damn
hard and we need to quit banging our skulls
together on it and look for a smarter way.

Whatever we write in KIF or whatever is going
to be useless until we run a really merciless
logic checker over it.  I have done this with
basic propositional knowledge bases and I can
tell you just from looking at it exactly what
will happen with the sort of hash that we are
looking in that Merged Ontology.  We have not
even got to the first cycle of iterations yet,
and you can't even start diagnosing what dumb
stuff you had been thinking until you do that.
That's my sadder but wiser experience, anyway.
My own research tells me we don't have strong
enough "analytic reasoning modules" as of yet --
I was shocked to hear anybody say that we had.

Jon Awbrey
