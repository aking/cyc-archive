Hi David,

	Thanks for your comments.  Responses below.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	I am considering making three major changes to the 
&gt; version of the
&gt; &gt; merged ontology document that I sent out on January 12th, 
&gt; and I would like
&gt; &gt; to solicit comments.  The proposed changes are as follows.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1.  Simplify the tip of the ontology so that it has the 
&gt; following structure.
&gt; 
&gt; My concern about simplifying this is that you have already 
&gt; gone through
&gt; one phase of simplification, and this is the second one.
&gt; In neither phase did you have anything other than the terms themselves
&gt; in the ontology to define them, and so I couldn't figure out what 
&gt; was 'lost' in the previous simplification. 
&gt; I would much prefer a definition phase as the next one for the working
&gt; paper rather than another deletion phase.

Well, I don't think it's true that the terms have only been defined by
themselves.  The tip of the ontology consists of subsumption relations,
which show how meaning is inherited.  Furthermore, each term in the tip is
associated with a docu-string, which attempts to explain in informal English
the corresponding term.  I agree that it is very useful to cash out the
meaning of concepts with formal axioms.  Some concepts already have
associated axioms, given in the "General Axioms" section of the "Merged
Ontology", and I will incorporate additional axioms as the document matures
(axioms developed both by me and by others). 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Individual Entity)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Relation Entity)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; You deleted Mediating. Why? I only saw one axiom for Mediating Entity:
&gt; (=&gt; (and (instance-of ?m Mediating) (has ?m ?x) (has ?m ?y))
&gt;     (nec (or (has ?x ?y) (has ?y ?x))) )
&gt; 
&gt; did you delete Mediating because this includes nec ?
&gt; Or because Mediating is an example of Thirdness?
&gt; Or because no one has helped define it better in FOL terms?
&gt; Or some other reason?

You're right that I did delete 'Mediating'.  I did this, because I and many
others found it very difficult to distinguish this notion from that of
'Relative'.  It may be that the Secondness/Thirdness distinction is crucial
from a philosophical perspective, but I don't see that it would be essential
to facilitating system interoperability or fulfilling its role in the other
applications envisioned for the SUO. 


&gt; 
&gt; In fact in reviewing, I see you deleted Independent and Relative both.
&gt; So you want to delete this entire triad, not just one part of it...
&gt; Is that because Triads are controversial, or just hard to explain?

Well, the distinction between Secondness and Thirdness is extremely
difficult to explain and, thus, controversial.  I didn't actually delete
'Independent' and 'Relative'; I just assigned each a nominal term -
'Individual' and 'Relation', respectively.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Object Physical)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Process Physical)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Schema Abstract)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Script Abstract)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Structure Relation)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Situation Relation)
&gt; &gt; (subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For reference, the original upper-level class hierarchy, as 
&gt; proposed by John
&gt; &gt; Sowa, is as follows.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Independent Entity)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Relative Entity)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Mediating Entity)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Physical Entity)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Abstract Entity)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Continuant Entity)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Occurrent Entity)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Actuality Independent)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Actuality Physical)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Form Independent)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Form Abstract)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Prehension Physical)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Prehension Relative)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Proposition Relative)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Proposition Abstract)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Nexus Physical)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Nexus Mediating)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Intention Abstract)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Intention Mediating)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Object Actuality)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Object Continuant)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Process Actuality)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Process Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Schema Form)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Schema Continuant)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Script Form)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Script Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Juncture Prehension)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Juncture Continuant)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Participation Prehension)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Participation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Description Proposition)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Description Continuant)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of History Proposition)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of History Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Structure Nexus)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Structure Continuant)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Situation Nexus)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Situation Occurrent)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Reason Intention)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Reason Continuant)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Purpose Intention)
&gt; &gt; ;;(subclass-of Purpose Occurrent)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2.  Recast the docu-strings for the high-level concepts in 
&gt; non-philosophical
&gt; &gt; language (so that their meaning is clear to engineers without a
&gt; &gt; philosophical background).  The revised docu-strings follow.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; 3.  The third proposed change is to eliminate the axioms of 
&gt; the "Theory of
&gt; &gt; Holes".  As I see it, these axioms are very interesting, 
&gt; but they are also
&gt; &gt; controversial and probably more relevant in a philosophical 
&gt; context than an
&gt; &gt; engineering one like the SUO.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree, I admittedly only looked quickly over them, but I saw
&gt; them as very general principles. Engineers have to deal with things
&gt; filling 'holes' and non-filled 'parts' all the time.

I see your point.  If others agree that the theory has a potential
Engineering application, then I'll be happy to insert it back into the
"Merged Ontology".
