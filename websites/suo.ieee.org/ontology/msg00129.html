David, 
	.	I realise you have put a lot of work to date into your
Starter Ontology. However, from your response, it sounds as though you are
unfamiliar with data and information modelling techniques and tools. 

	.	Entity-relationship modelling is the most common for data
modelling. Object-role modelling is more advanced, and generally classified
as an information modeling approach, since it more fully specifies both the
pieces of information (or the data representing them) and the processes
relating them. It gets close to giving the best of both data modelling and
business process modelling in the one presentation. An impediment is that
each modelling technique is usually presented visually by relatively
expensive software packages. 

	.	This is a long way from providing multi-dimensional
representations, since all of them provide only 2 dimensional charts.
Nevertheless, they do considerably facilitate grasping the overall structure
of the information.  

	.	I personally believe much of the discussion about different
perspectives for the SUO would become much clearer to all if such visual
presentations were to be used (although, here is where I suggest proper
multi-dimensional modelling would help, by better showing natures of the
structural differences among the different perspectives). I also believe
such techniques would facilitate comparative assessments of the various
existing ontologies, and would also help us identify which areas in them are
already well defined, and which require further development. 

	.	Developing the SUO without such visualisations is a bit like
trying to manufacture a car from scratch with only a hazy idea of what types
of parts are needed, and without any plans setting out the ways each of the
parts will fit together. It could be embarrassing if the clutch doesn't have
a return spring to re-engage when one lifts one's foot from the pedal, if
the steering is unstable and wants to swing over to a full lock the moment
one lets go the wheel, etc., ........ . 

	.	By the way, a typical car has a few thousand components,
generally in the range 2,000 to 4,000 from memory. Doubtless you have seen
car service manuals in auto shops. Relatively comprehensive ones have lots
of diagrams, and generally run to a couple of inches thickness of thin paper
- say a thousand pages? 

	.	I suggest our project shouldn't be underestimated for what
it entails.

Graham Horn said:
&gt; 	.	I am keen on getting means of visualising the ontologies,
&gt; since that vastly reduces the work involved in getting a feel for the
&gt; structure. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Your mention of relationships makes me wonder whether
&gt; what you are proposing lends itself to some form of entity - relationship
&gt; modelling. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Is there any relatively convenient visualisation of what you
&gt; are proposing, that we can view?
&gt; 

I'm afraid the visualization I think of is usually of a few limited forms.
 1) coloured marbles with coloured hoops
 2) coloured paperclips binding coloured worms
 3) trellis of beads with different coloured beads and trellis segments
 4) A file cabinet of drawers full of folders with filled-in paper forms

These are usually my set of metaphors that I use to visualize.
I don't have software to represent an ontology in these forms,
I just use that amazing creation known as my mind.

If we were to take the fact:

(INSTANCE-OF DAVID PERSON)

I would visualize this as a "(INSTANCE-OF DAVID PERSON)" 
coloured paperclip binding together the "DAVID" coloured worm,
the "INSTANCE-OF" coloured worm, and the "PERSON" coloured worm.

This can also be seen as a "(INSTANCE-OF DAVID PERSON)" coloured
marble sitting in a hoop for a consistent theory which I haven't named.

Alternately, it might be a "DAVID" coloured marble sitting in a hoop
coloured with "(INSTANCE-OF ?X PERSON)", signifying all the instances
of a type named "PERSON".

Or, it might be a "PERSON" coloured marble sitting in a hoop coloured
with "(INSTANCE-OF DAVID ?C)", signifying all the types that David is
an instance of.

The trellis image would have a bead coloured "DAVID" that has a
trellis segment coloured "INSTANCE-OF" connecting it to a bead coloured
"PERSON".  The Trellis image, in degenerate forms, can be drawn
as a simple tree as well.

The file cabinet image could have the file cabinet labeled with some
logical theory's name, some  folder labeled with "DAVID" containg
a paper sheet with a pre-printed form with a question "INSTANCE-OF" 
filled in with the answer "PERSON".

This is just a sample of how I use these visualizations.

David
