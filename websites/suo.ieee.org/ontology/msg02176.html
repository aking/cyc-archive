Dear Lee,

&gt; Matthew,
&gt; 
&gt; We seem to be ships passing in the night, and I would not 
&gt; think that the
&gt; differences can be worked by email in this forum without greatly
&gt; overtaxing the patience of others.  

MW: I notice that members of this list are not backward in criticising
contributions that tax their patience. On the whole I think this is
a topic that is likely to be of interest to many list members. On the
other hand, I would also be happy to pursue this with you off-list if
I am wrong.

&gt; Giving, conversing, representing--
&gt; these activities mentioned in my posting below seem to me to be such
&gt; obvious examples of relations that are not adequately 
&gt; accounted for with
&gt; two elements, or concatenations of them, that I am wondering what your
&gt; notion of an example can be (something that eludes the token-type
&gt; conjugacy?) that you ask for more.  Could it be that we are addressing
&gt; different problems or assuming different contexts of 
&gt; discourse? (a real
&gt; not a rhetorical question)

MW: Yes, I think this is most likely. If you see my response to Jon you
will see that I think representation and reality are getting confused.
So to sum it up in an example: 

 - Do I think that 3 things (at least) are involved in a giving activity? 
   Yes absolutely.
 - Do I think that this can only possibly be represented by a triadic
   relation?
   Absolutely not.

Note: I have no problem if YOU want to represent it by a triadic relation.
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly, your willingness to posit full-blown possible 
&gt; worlds for each
&gt; and every infinitesimal variation seems to me to violate so 
&gt; grossly the
&gt; conceptual parsimony and exactitude that you value elsewhere 
&gt; that I again
&gt; question whether we are in the same context of discourse.  

MW: Without concrete examples I really can't be sure about this.

&gt; Surely, you
&gt; would not permit this move if you saw it as exponentially 
&gt; exploding even
&gt; the merest flicker of a possibility well beyond what is 
&gt; needed to account
&gt; for it.

MW: As I explained below, I am not much bothered by absolute
numbers of records. On our route to where we are we have
multiplied the number of records required a number of times.
Each time this has added power to the model, whilst simplifying
it conceptually, and each time it has been worth it. A
requirement for an infinite number of records would be a problem
of course, but what I see here is just 3 for one, a possible
object requires a possible world and a whole part relation to say
it is in it. I don't find that scary. But perhaps I misunderstand
the point you are making.
&gt; 
&gt; In an SUO forum, it would indeed make sense to tie this discussion to
&gt; methodology for construction of a reference object, with an attempt at
&gt; transparency in relating design choices to purposes to be served. Many
&gt; differences would then be cut away demands of a common project. This
&gt; is why I repeat at every opportunity the desirability of a 
&gt; working paper
&gt; on method and a review of relevant best/existing practices, 
&gt; as well as the
&gt; use of what I believe is a common standards' term-- 
&gt; 'reference object'--
&gt; for what we can hope to achieve.   

MW: I suspect a review would reveal mostly how little practice there is, 
and that probably none of it could be called "good" without considerable
qualification.

So as to methodology, I think we are before the stage where we could
achieve reasonable consensus. On the other hand I think this thread is
addressing a key issue to reaching that consensus.
&gt; 
&gt; I am mindful that when the question was posed (under the 
&gt; topic that Jim
&gt; Schoening labeled Funding Realism) whether there was anyone not on a
&gt; short-term government contract who could commit to the 4-5 
&gt; year period to
&gt; develop and maintain a standard, you were the only person to respond
&gt; affirmatively. So I do appreciate that your persistence in smoking out
&gt; deep differences is implicitly tied to the project at hand.  

MW: When you have no formal funding at all, it is easy not to be tied
to it :-( But I also have considerable experience of developing
standards, and in a closely related area at that, so I have a good
sense of realism. In particular I know that there are no short-cuts,
only diversions.
&gt; 
&gt; A few interlinear responses below underline the points above.

MW: and responses from me.
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; 
&gt; Lee

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matthew,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since I do not view your position as philosophically or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logically adequate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the full range of human experience, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: I note this. What I lack is evidence or proof that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; your view is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct. If you can identify where the position is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; inadequate and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which ranges of human experience it does not apply to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; then we might
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make progress.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There was a Polish philosopher named Tadeusz 
&gt; Kotarbinski who took
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something like your position to great lengths.  He variously 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position reism, pan-somatism, concretism, semantic reism. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: I'm not familiar with this person, but I support 
&gt; his approach of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taking things to great lengths. This way you see if it 
&gt; breaks, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where, and then you know the limitations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarski, insofar
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as he bothered to work out a metaphysical position, 
&gt; acknowledged
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kotarbinski as his master and his early and famous work on 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth in formal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; systems is couched to make place for a reist approach.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I once spent a good bit of effort to show how this position, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my own, can be stretched to cover just about anything, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including ethics
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and aesthetics. But it has one great limitation that may have 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some bearing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on an SUO effort.  It covers experience after the 
&gt; fact, after the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience has become manifest in some spatio-temporal 
&gt; &gt; &gt; phenomenon.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: This is no longer true when you introduce a possible worlds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approach which allows you to consider possible futures, either
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypothetical or intended, as well as possible pasts, 
&gt; which may be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; linked to or detatched from the present.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not quite right, since the notion of a possible world (that is,
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibilities made manifest in a hypothetical spatio-temporal 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ensemble)
&gt; &gt; &gt; and (to use Kotarbinski's early contribution to possible 
&gt; &gt; &gt; world semantics)
&gt; &gt; &gt; of an "empty name" as what computer people might call a 
&gt; 'wild card'
&gt; &gt; &gt; standing for such a world is something short of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophical category
&gt; &gt; &gt; of modality.  Modality in its best developed sense is the 
&gt; notion of
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility detached from (or better, prescinded from) time 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and space.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: We used to have a plethora of abstract individuals in 
&gt; our models.
&gt; &gt; Our analysis has shown that either these can be represeted 
&gt; by possible
&gt; &gt; worlds, or by classes. Being detached from time and space 
&gt; suggests that
&gt; &gt; we would treat them as classes. Some specific examples of 
&gt; what you mean
&gt; &gt; would help to determine this, or whether you are talking about
&gt; &gt; something we have not come across.
&gt; 
&gt; JLA:  It would appear that I need to get into the interstices of
&gt; your work to see what you would consider a telling example.  

MW: I would be happy to help you do that.

&gt; The movement
&gt; from what you call 'abstract individuals' to 'worlds' and 'classes'
&gt; reminds me of moves that have been made in 20th century philosophical
&gt; logic.

MW: Well since I am having extreme difficulty in getting an example out
of you, let me give you one. One sort of abstract individual we used to
have was the idea of a "typical individual" that was abstract. It was a 
complete description of an  individual and would be like a template that 
could be copied and used to make concrete ones. We eventually concluded 
that this was really a class, and the ones that were made from it were 
its members.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The view you espouse is workable but more limited; in it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility is
&gt; &gt; &gt; postulated to be always conjoined with some space-time 
&gt; instantiation
&gt; &gt; &gt; (which may be placed hypothetically in the past, present or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; future) rather
&gt; &gt; &gt; than seen a fundamental category in its own right.  Possible 
&gt; &gt; &gt; worlds theory
&gt; &gt; &gt; is certainly an advance over the attempt to absorb 
&gt; possibility into
&gt; &gt; &gt; potentiality, but it is a step short of a view of 
&gt; multiple, indeed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; infinite possibilia for each and every sign.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: What I have seen of modality has left me singularly unimpressed,
&gt; &gt; however, you may easily be talking about a version of modality I am
&gt; &gt; not familiar with. 
&gt; 
&gt; JLA: There is a long history to this concept that will not be found in
&gt; textbooks on modal logic, since that academic field is but one of many
&gt; specialized applications the concept may take.

MW: Something to explore then.
&gt; 
&gt; However, my standard question you will be expecting
&gt; &gt; by now is please give me a specific example of what you 
&gt; think can be 
&gt; &gt; expressed using modality that cannot be equally well 
&gt; expressed using 
&gt; &gt; possible worlds.
&gt; 
&gt; JLA:
&gt; The example adapted from a Dedekind cut below was intended to 
&gt; suggest that
&gt; one really is presented with an unmanageable and otiose complexity by
&gt; inflating possibilia into worlds.

MW: Numbers of objects is what it takes to make context explicit. I do
not think of this a complexity.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thus sees little point in asserting experience, human or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otherwise, as a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; broader category than empiria.  Thus in your recent exchange 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on 'giving'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Chris Menzel, you cover giving after an act of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; giving has become
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifest, while Chris would like to assert some ternary 
&gt; &gt; &gt; aspect to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logic of giving, or in natural language to the dative case, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether or not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is made manifest in an activity.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: You can express as many aspects to giving as you wish. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use binary or ternary relations is largely a matter of how 
&gt; &gt; &gt; you want to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; view things, not what you are viewing.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If your distinction between the 'how' and the 'what' of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; view of giving
&gt; &gt; &gt; is designed to highlight the issue of meaning, then I agree.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I see two
&gt; &gt; &gt; people grasping an object and releasing it from one to the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; other, that, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; take it, is the 'what' you are referring to.  Viewing this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'what' as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; act of giving is the 'how' I might view it.  Similarly, two people
&gt; &gt; &gt; emitting sounds at each other and responding mutually in body 
&gt; &gt; &gt; language in
&gt; &gt; &gt; a kind of dance of the eyes, gestures and facial expressions, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a 'what'.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Viewing this as a "conversation" is a 'how'.  If this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; captures what you
&gt; &gt; &gt; have in mind, then my argument is that a 'how' that captures the
&gt; &gt; &gt; meaningfulness of the act to the actors requires some tertium 
&gt; &gt; &gt; quid beyond
&gt; &gt; &gt; the physical dynamic.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: From where I stand you are just talking about a couple 
&gt; of activities
&gt; &gt; that conform to a particular pattern that marks them outr 
&gt; as members of
&gt; &gt; a class. Is there anything else here?
&gt; 
&gt; JLA: Yes, the specific class of activities that I am trying 
&gt; to locate is
&gt; that for which a binary explanatory structure misses 
&gt; something important.

MW: Again I think the issue is one of confusing reality with
representation. There are any number of activities that
require 3 or more participants. However, that does not
require that they are represented by relations of any
particular arity. The two are simply not connected (by
necessity).

MW: From where I am standing it looks as if you come from a 
tradition where there is a strong tie between reality and
some elements of its representation. In database land this
gets knocked out of you quite quickly when you see just
how many different ways there are that you can do it.

&gt; This opens to question of whether a binary structure misses 
&gt; something in
&gt; the notion of class itself, such that your proposed remedy-- 
&gt; a dualism of
&gt; 'things' and 'sets'-- will break down.  

MW: I really think I would have noticed by now if there was
a big problem. I didn't get here by latching on to some latest
fashion.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now I would not argue that you fail to 'cover' giving, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; since you can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provide a verbal account of each and every instance after it 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occurs, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once an act has occurred to every 'extension' of it in the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense you use
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this term, but I would argue that there is something about 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the logic of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the dative case that is missing in your view of it. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Our model can deal with an arbitrary number of 
&gt; things involved
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with giving. We simply choose to represent them in a binary form
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (from a KIF point of view). It can then from this base of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; information
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; support views that might be ternary or what ever is wished for.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I agree: your key term here is "support views".  
&gt; What is actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; happening is that the ternary view is added by the user, who 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is supplying
&gt; &gt; &gt; the element of interpretation that the binary structure 
&gt; &gt; &gt; leaves out. It is
&gt; &gt; &gt; the user's "view" that is being "supported."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: We work particularly hard to capture these things. Our approach
&gt; &gt; to context information is to capture it explicitly, and 
&gt; relate it to 
&gt; &gt; the objects concerned. This is aided by our treatment of relations
&gt; &gt; as first class objects, i.e. objects that can be referred to in
&gt; &gt; other relations.
&gt; 
&gt; If the SUO effort proves workable, I would be interested to learn more
&gt; about this, to see whether I can make my point more precisely 
&gt; in a context
&gt; that has meaning for you.

MW: I would appreciate that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would also argue
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is missing in the binary view of giving is also missing 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the binary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; treatment of other concepts crucial to an account of human 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; institutions,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; including the institution of science.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Some examples rather than assertions would be 
&gt; really helpful.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; See the addition of conversation above, which may be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; generalized to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; example of language as such, and on the micro-level to 
&gt; the example of
&gt; &gt; &gt; representation as such.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: So far you have only talked in generalities, I would 
&gt; really like to
&gt; &gt; get you to the "John said to Mary ..." level. Until we are 
&gt; talking about
&gt; &gt; specific examples of things that can or cannot be 
&gt; expressed, I'm not 
&gt; &gt; going to be convinced.
&gt; 
&gt; JLA:
&gt; You could substitute for "conversation" 'John said X to Mary etc', for
&gt; "giving" 'John gave Y to Mary' etc., for "representation" 'A 
&gt; represents B
&gt; through C,' and so on.  But I suspect that you have in mind 
&gt; examples tied
&gt; to things you have been working on.

MW: I am happy to deal with examples that have meaning to you. After all
we claim that our models are intended to work for "life the universe and
everything". So:

(speach y)
(speaker-in John y)
(listener-in Mary y)
(spoken-in X y)

(act-of-giving x)
(giver-in John x)
(receiver-in Mary x)
(given-in Y x)

(representation x)
(represented-in B x)
(representing-in A x)
(representation-through C x)

If it were appropriate you could add some axioms that said things like 
"for each giving activity there is a giver, a receiver and a gift".

What have I not represented? (as opposed to anything about HOW I have
represented it).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With respect to a computational ontology to be used in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conjunction with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relational database, my argument may make no practical 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; difference so long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as we are interested in using the ontology to search and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; mine what has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already been achieved and certified in some sense as 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information.  But to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the extent that we may wish to use an ontological artifact 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for sciences of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discovery or for deliberation, which contain a purely 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hypothetical or even
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imaginative element, and in which we wish to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; especially alert to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emergent categories and to the repurposing and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; reconceptualizing of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; information for unanticipated needs, we may want to provide
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; architectonically for a position that concedes a degree 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of reality to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concepts without grounding them dogmatically in some 
&gt; 'concrete'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifestation and its extensions. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: As stated above all this is supported through the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible worlds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approach we incorrporate, as stated above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And as replied above, the possible worlds approach still 
&gt; contains the
&gt; &gt; &gt; concretist grounding but attempts to correct its obvious 
&gt; &gt; &gt; limitations by
&gt; &gt; &gt; detaching it from the actual world to hypothetical worlds and
&gt; &gt; &gt; quasi-worlds. Within a certain range this will 'work'.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Again I am looking for specific examples that do not work of the
&gt; &gt; "John said to Mary ..." variety.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: Also think about how likely it is that I would be able 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to have a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position that was not capable of lookihng forwards as well 
&gt; &gt; &gt; as backwards.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shell is one of the most successful companies in the world, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and has been
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuously for about 100 years. One of the reasons for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; this is its 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expertise in planning ... What chance would I have 
&gt; internally if I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't support that?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shell is certainly a great and successful company, which 
&gt; has had to
&gt; &gt; &gt; combine economic, financial, geopolitical, legal, personnel, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; engineering
&gt; &gt; &gt; and scientific considerations, among others.  It is a 
&gt; complex world in
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself and anything that works within it shows good prospect 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of working
&gt; &gt; &gt; internally for other modern institutions constructed along 
&gt; &gt; &gt; similar lines.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; But 100 years is not a very impressive span of time in these 
&gt; &gt; &gt; matters. If
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shell exists as a distinct institution 100 years from 
&gt; now, there is no
&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee that it will be animated by a mode of thought based 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the years
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1901-2001.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Well since most current modes of thinking are based on 
&gt; 2000 year old
&gt; &gt; ideas I don't have a huge expectation of change over the 
&gt; next 100 years.
&gt; &gt; Anyway, how do you expect us to cater for modes of thinking that are
&gt; &gt; not in practice now?
&gt; 
&gt; JLA:
&gt; We need to distinguish modes of thinking that are in practice (an
&gt; implicit *logica utens*) from those that have been captured 
&gt; in textbooks
&gt; (*logica docens*).  There is much in practice now that is not yet
&gt; logically canonical, and we would be prudent to provide an 
&gt; open structure
&gt; that enables an 'upper level' artifact to grow.

MW: That would be my ambition too. Again, the IIDEAS architecture
shows how I think that can be achieved.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am, of course, able to participate cheerfully in an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ontology constructed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on principles in the general family to which your 
&gt; &gt; &gt; position belongs, so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long as the purpose of the effort is clarified to be limited 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to uses for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which this position is appropriate.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: One reason I am pursuing this discussion is that if 
&gt; there really
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are things it cannot handle, I would really like to know.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The key is how far one can rely on the shared language and mutual
&gt; &gt; &gt; recognition of purposes of a collection of users to 
&gt; supply the missing
&gt; &gt; &gt; interpretative element.  To the extent one can rely on a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; *community* of
&gt; &gt; &gt; users, much can be left tacit, and we need not provide 
&gt; &gt; &gt; architectonically
&gt; &gt; &gt; for computational elements that community members can 
&gt; supply better on
&gt; &gt; &gt; their own.  But giving some computational form to the tertium 
&gt; &gt; &gt; quid will
&gt; &gt; &gt; prove increasingly relevant to the extent that we wish to automate
&gt; &gt; &gt; mutually untranslatble patterns of interpretation and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; orientation and to
&gt; &gt; &gt; embody them in agent protocols.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: I would hope to get to a point where everything can be defined
&gt; &gt; either by formal axioms, or by pointing, both of which I consider
&gt; &gt; to be adequately unambiguous to need no further qualification. My 
&gt; &gt; intuition tells me this should be possible, but I await the outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; JLA: I think I understand and can support what you aspire to. 
&gt;  From my way
&gt; of looking at things you are aiming at a computational 
&gt; ontology limited
&gt; to certain specifiable sign types and permissible relations 
&gt; among them.
&gt; And these types may, in turn, be seen as appropriate to 
&gt; certain purposes
&gt; and methods that can themselves be specified.  And the result 
&gt; of all those
&gt; would be a 'reference object' set against a broader context of methods
&gt; and purposes.

MW: That sounds pretty accurate. What else are we trying to do here?
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if, as in our current effort,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is strong resistance to narrowing the purpose, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: I do not wish to rule out other view points. If you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; read up on the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IIDEAS architecture you will see that I think it is 
&gt; important to be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; able to support a range of different viewpoints for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; different purposes,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that also I want a view that is able to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; support/integrate all of them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (if possible - I recognise that it may not be).
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was not referring to any resistance on your part-- to the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; contrary, you
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been by my lights a very reasonable voice on this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; issue-- but to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; persistent failure of those in greater control of this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; process to show an
&gt; &gt; &gt; openness to the repeated requests from many other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; participants for greater
&gt; &gt; &gt; clarity in purpose and attendant methodology.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Well I could not agree more. I am happy enough about
&gt; &gt; purpose, but until we have a methodology we have no chance
&gt; &gt; of engineering a solution. To me it therefore follows that
&gt; &gt; any ontology development work at present is about
&gt; &gt; getting the methodology developed.
&gt; 
&gt; JLA:
&gt; Yes, if we want something that will last and provide its own 
&gt; grounds for
&gt; self-correction.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counsel that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what I would regard as a more capacious and open-ended view 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not be ruled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out prematurely.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MW: And what would that be?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Though this is not really an email topic, let me try a 
&gt; quick, somewhat
&gt; &gt; &gt; fanciful example.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose we drew a line and cut it at an arbitrary point, and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the cut
&gt; &gt; &gt; there exploded an infinity of possibilities not only for 
&gt; resolving the
&gt; &gt; &gt; point into a continuum of infinitesimals, but for the 
&gt; 'how' (in your
&gt; &gt; &gt; sense) of viewing each infinitesimal.  Is it useful to 
&gt; construe one as
&gt; &gt; &gt; opposed to another infinitesimal variation as defining a distinct
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'possible world'?  Or would we want a less inflated vocabulary for
&gt; &gt; &gt; handling these variations?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW: Actually, number of objects required is not something I 
&gt; see as a big
&gt; &gt; issue, compared to precision and consistency. So I have no 
&gt; problem here
&gt; &gt; with there being a possible world with each possible outcome you're 
&gt; &gt; interested in. Of course I might not present it to a user 
&gt; that way where
&gt; &gt; some context has been established.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; JLA: I don't see that possible worlds theory is a very 
&gt; *precise* way of
&gt; talking about infinitesimal variation, since it builds in 
&gt; other ideas--
&gt; contained in the term 'world'-- not essential to every view of the
&gt; problem.  And again, the appearance of consistency is achieved by
&gt; over-extending the spatio-temporal metaphor.  Still, I do not
&gt; underestimate its appeal.

MW: Well I am not trying to express every view of the problem. I am
trying to find a view that other views can be translated into and
out of without loss of information.
