Vote: Yes. (Is good to have a starting point. Very likely the practice of
the standard's users will evolve in time,  and  could be useful to MAP too -
and not only to MERGE -  different ontologies to some common general ambit
that will be identified when and if needed ).

Oggetto: SUO: Vote on Merged Ontology as a 'Base Document' for SUO WG


&gt;
&gt; SUO Participants,
&gt;
&gt; 1. Attached is the latest version of Ian Niles'  Merged Ontology.
&gt;
&gt; 2. This message is a call for a vote as to whether this document should be
&gt; approved as a 'Base Document' for IEEE P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology
&gt; Working Group.  Within IEEE, there is no official definition of a Base
&gt; Document; however, the definitions below from the IEEE Learning Technology
&gt; Standards Committee (our original sponsor) are as good as any.
&gt;
&gt; 3. The purpose of this vote is to determine the level of consensus we have
&gt; for focusing work on this document.  In other words, we need to decide if
we
&gt; are going to go down this path or not.  Multiple base documents are
&gt; possible, so anyone else is free to submit one.
&gt;
&gt; 4. The primary purpose of this vote is NOT to propose improvements to the
&gt; document, unless they are major enough for you to vote against focusing
work
&gt; on this document.  However, such general improvement comments are welcome
&gt; and will be resolved (but not until after completion of this Base Document
&gt; vote).
&gt;
&gt; 5. Since we are still in the process of establishing official voting
rights,
&gt; I suggest we first conduct this as an unofficial straw poll, such that
&gt; anyone can cast a vote.  After resolving all comments, if consensus is not
&gt; clear, we will have the option of conducting a formal vote (once voting
&gt; rights are established).
&gt;
&gt; 6. Your options for voting are YES (comments optional), NO (comments
&gt; required), or ABSTAIN (comments optional).
&gt;
&gt; 7. Please send your votes directly to me (to reduce list traffic), though
&gt; you may send them to the entire list if you desire.
&gt;
&gt; 8. Please vote by Jan 29, 2001.
&gt;
&gt; 9. Please send in any questions or comments.
&gt;
&gt; Jim Schoening
&gt; Chair, SUO WG
&gt;
&gt; IEEE LTSC Nomenclature of Documents
&gt; working paper: Does not automatically get agenda time. Not necessarily
&gt; related to standards words (e.g., liaison reports, the agenda itself). A
&gt; working paper is any document with a document number or a document
&gt; introduced at a meeting (assuming the WG accepts it as a working paper).
&gt; Working papers don't automatically receive agenda time. The WG Chair may
&gt; choose to give higher agenda priority to discussion on working papers
&gt; received two weeks prior to the meeting. (Members may object to discussion
&gt; on papers with less than two weeks notice, but the objection is based on
the
&gt; need to digest the document, not to obstruct the process; and the
objection
&gt; may prevent the paper from get agenda time, but not necessarily prevent
the
&gt; discussion -- be considerate both ways, the chair will rule.)
&gt; base document: Starting point for standards words (it's clear the document
&gt; *can* be transformed into standards words). Has no official weight (not a
&gt; standard). Might not be in standards wording. Might not be complete with
&gt; respect to the scope and/or final standard. Might be multiple base
&gt; documents. Automatically allocated agenda time since this is the main
&gt; product of the WG. Most base documents represent substantial work created
&gt; outside the committee and introduced into the WG.
&gt; working draft: The base documents (assuming more than one) are combined
over
&gt; time. The combination document now becomes a working draft. The working
&gt; draft is refined and polished. The working draft is adapted to the style
&gt; guides. Working drafts may be available to the public. Automatically
&gt; allocated agenda time (the rest below all have agenda time).
&gt; base document vs. working draft: There may be multiple base documents that
&gt; become the starting points for a standard. There is only one working draft
&gt; for a standard (but many revisions, each with its own document number). A
&gt; base document identifies the origin of the work for several reasons:
&gt; technical, rationale, intellectual property, acknowledgement.
&gt; committee draft: The working draft is now in the style of a standard. The
&gt; document substatially represents the intended final standard. Changes may
be
&gt; made. There may be several committee drafts.
&gt; working draft vs. committee draft: Each revision of the working draft
&gt; represents a batch of edits that the WG accepts. Typically, there is a new
&gt; working draft each meeting while the document is being developed, but
&gt; working drafts may be less frequent. Committee drafts are important
&gt; milestones because they represent to the public "this is what the final
&gt; standard will look like". Working drafts may be available or not to the
&gt; public. Committe drafts are public. Working drafts may be used to solicit
&gt; public comments. Committee drafts are always used to solicit public
&gt; comments.
&gt; draft standard: The document is *complete*. There may be minor editoral
&gt; changes, but no substantive changes are intended. Draft standards may be
&gt; referred to (i.e., incorporated by reference) in *other* standards.
&gt; approved standard: The document is now an official standard.
&gt; Summary: Committee members submit working papers. Working papers may be
&gt; related to committee work, technical contributions, and so on. Base
&gt; documents are working papers approved as a "base document". One or more
base
&gt; documents may be part of a standard. When base documents are revised they
&gt; become a new working paper but with the automatic agenda item. At some
point
&gt; the working papers and/or base documents are combined to become a working
&gt; draft. Later on, additional working papers and additional base documents
may
&gt; be added to the working draft. Working drafts may be made available for
&gt; public comment. Committee drafts represent the full intention of the
&gt; standard. Committee drafts are available for public comment and are likely
&gt; to be balloted (comments from voting and non-voting members). A draft
&gt; standard represents the completed standard in every way (wording, style,
&gt; layout, etc.) except that it is not official. An approved draft standard
&gt; becomes a official standard after a succesful ballot and a process review.
