&gt; &gt; My general attitude with respect to KIF,
&gt; &gt; and not especially about the self-styled
&gt; &gt; "base" document or "merged ontology" (MO),
&gt; &gt; is that we are not even at the beginning,
&gt; &gt; yet, of what it would take to start out
&gt; &gt; in the direction of any hope of success.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In its lack of integral capacities for
&gt; &gt; quotation, at minimum, much less for a
&gt; &gt; power and style of further "reflection" --
&gt; &gt; I cannot call an operation "reification"
&gt; &gt; until somebody shows me that it creates
&gt; &gt; or reveals a "thing" that is really new --
&gt; &gt; KIF, in fact, appears to take a couple
&gt; &gt; of steps backward from the Lisp 1.0
&gt; &gt; that I knew as a child, which leaves
&gt; &gt; us in the neigborhood of Lisp -1.0.
&gt; 
&gt; Jon-
&gt; 
&gt; KIF 3.0 does contain elaborate mechanisms
&gt; for quotation (and quasi-quotation),

I am extremely glad and even a little bit relieved to hear this --
I am only going on what I was told the last time that I asked --
which raises another point in my mind:

Among the many things that can make these very sensitive flowers
of open collaborative work dry up and blow away is the very real
risk that different people are working with radically different
models of what the overall game is -- I said "radically", not
just "slightly".  Like some people put all of their playing
pieces on the table all of the time -- they are working with
the mental model of jigsaw puzzle, let us say -- but other
people trot out their tokens only on those occasions when
it is time to call trump on another player -- they have
another mental model of what the purpose of play is.
But I will say more about this on another occasion.

But the point of bringing it up hic et nunc is to help me
explain what I mean when I say, as I do from time to time,
something of the form:

"So &amp; so has exhibited no interest in such &amp; such."

I mean that they are not bringing what they may or may not have
into the open and hashing it here in this Forum, or only at such
times as they may find it convenient to let other people know how
much they have been wasting their time in the sandbox, so they deem.

&gt; but these were removed from the SUO-KIF core deliberately
&gt; as they were felt to be too exotic for everyday use, and
&gt; they greatly complicate the semantics.

If you say that it complicates the system to make it adequate ...

&gt; However, there is still a proposal (details being thrashed out)
&gt; for a 'meta-extension' to SUO-KIF which will include both string
&gt; quotation and structural quotation, providing the ability to define
&gt; recursive operations on the language's own syntax.  It will also have
&gt; a truth-predicate which comes as close to the Goedelian cliff as one
&gt; ever wants to get.  I believe this will provide you with all the
&gt; meta-syntactic power you could hope to get.

This is good, but past experience has taught me better than
to hold my breath while I await the yield of this thrashing.
At any rate, I am guessing that you under-estimate my hopes,
not for what a particular tradition of logical endeavor may
produce, but for what the ultimately successful development
and the critically reflective evolution of logic may unfold.

&gt; LISP 1.5 allows a lot of self-description;
&gt; but it doesnt give you any quantifiers.

Yeah, but, it's a generic programing language --
whatever can be done effectively can be done
in it -- I mean, you could do it all in BASIC --
that is, if you like that sort of thing.
The only question is "How easy is it?"

&gt; Recursion and self-description is a pretty heady mixture,
&gt; but adding quantification to self-description is a bit
&gt; like mixing diesel oil and weedkiller.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will comment on its logical incapacities,
&gt; &gt; from the standpoint of practical efficiency,
&gt; &gt; a lack that is hardly any special fault of it,
&gt; &gt; since it merely shares in the degraded condition
&gt; &gt; of the logical languages that a certain tradition
&gt; &gt; has seen fit to devolve "on us", but another time.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if you have any better ideas, please do share them with us as
&gt; soon as you can manage it.  There are known limitations on deductive
&gt; efficiency for any reasonably expressive languages, as I'm sure you
&gt; know, which cannot be blamed on mere traditional stubbornness.

I get the sense that there is a very radical misunderstanding here --
I refuse to declare "yet another incommensurability" (YAI, Verily!),
at least, not just yet, but my "naively optimistic mentality" (NOM),
sad to say, gives me no clue as to how it might ultimately vindicate
its presumptuous faith in concrete reasonableness.  I will have to
think about this problem a while before I try to address it again.

Sincerely Yours,

Jon Awbrey
