Robert,

Congratulations!   This, at least, has some meat on it,
and I encourage you to put it through the SUO gauntlet.

&gt; Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I have been thinking about submitting the Foundation Ontology, but it
&gt; looks like I need a couple more weeks. In the discussion below, I give an
&gt; overall picture of the ontological framework that I envision, I discuss some
&gt; of the conceptual problems being addressed, and I suggest a path for review
&gt; and editing. Because of my expanded response, I am cc-ing this to the list
&gt; at large.
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; The *overall picture* I have for an "industrial strength"
&gt; ontological framework goes is follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. There is a basic or core IFF ontology that interfaces the new KIF logical
&gt; language with the metalevel ontological framework. This would be close to
&gt; that expressed as Chris Menzel's Basic Ontology, but perhaps a bit simpler
&gt; since only a few things are needed -- class, subclass, function, signature,
&gt; pairing '[-]', and projections '(- 1)', '(- 2)' etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. There is a (rather large) metalevel (= structural level) ontology that
&gt; breaks up into two essential parts corresponding to the large/small
&gt; distinction in set-theoretic and category-theoretic foundations.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.1 The upper metalevel represents the "large" notion of foundations. This
&gt; is where the Foundation Ontology resides; the other components in this upper
&gt; metalevel are the Category Theory Ontology and the large Classification &amp;
&gt; Concept Lattice Ontology, the latter allowing us to represent the *truth
&gt; classification* and *truth concept lattice*, an overall goal for this
&gt; effort. The Foundation Ontology essentially represents set-theoretic classes
&gt; and their functions -- thus modeling the "large" notion of foundations.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.2 The lower metalevel represents the "small" notion of foundations. A
&gt; specific goal of the lower metalevel is to represent some central notions of
&gt; model theory -- models (first-order structures), expressions and
&gt; satisfaction. In the approach that I am suggesting, models are 2-dimensional
&gt; structures composed of small classifications along one dimension and small
&gt; hypergraphs (or spans) along the other; here classifications represent the
&gt; instance-type distinction, whereas hypergraphs represent the entity-relation
&gt; distinction. The lower metalevel makes heavy use of the upper metalevel --
&gt; indeed, a goal in modeling the lower metalevel is to abide by the
&gt; CATEGORICAL PROPERTY (see [<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02399.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02399.html</A>]).
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The object level is where the content ontologies reside. These could be
&gt; very generic, such as a 4D ontology, or specific, such as ontologies for
&gt; government or higher education. It should be noted that the object level
&gt; satisfies a representation property similar to the categorical property
&gt; satisfied by the lower metalevel -- the ontological language used is not
&gt; KIF; instead it is the terminology defined and axiomatized in the lower
&gt; metalevel (terms such as 'subtype', 'instance', 'expression', 'model',
&gt; 'ontology', 'relation', 'entity', 'role', etc.).
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a discussion of some of the *conceptual problems* being addressed:
&gt; 
&gt; One reason for the delay in submitting the Foundation Ontology is the
&gt; following. Initially, I had thought that the Foundation Ontology, which as I
&gt; mentioned above models set-theoretic classes and their functions, would
&gt; encode the axioms for a *Cartesian-closed category* (and that the Set
&gt; Ontology, which models small sets and their functions, would encode the
&gt; axioms for a *topos*). To test this I was using lower metalevel ontologies,
&gt; such as the Classification Ontology. But recently, in order to satisfy the
&gt; categorical property, I seemed to need "power classes" (see
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02381.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg02381.html</A>]) in order to represent some
&gt; aspect of fibrations (specifically, the category of classifications and
&gt; infomorphisms is fibered over the category of sets and function along the
&gt; "instance functor"). See McLarty's suggestion to use Benabou's theory of
&gt; fibrations and definability
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/category/risc/catlist/goedel-cat">http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/category/risc/catlist/goedel-cat</A>].
&gt; My current belief is that fibers can be represented in the Foundation
&gt; Ontology, without a full-blown representation of fibrations a la Benabou. In
&gt; order to do this however, we seem to require that the Foundation Ontology
&gt; encode the axioms for a *topos* (see McLarty's first order expression of the
&gt; theory of a well-pointed topos with natural numbers and choice
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9802/msg00072.html">http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9802/msg00072.html</A>]. These
&gt; axioms are now incorporated in the Foundation Ontology. Perhaps this version
&gt; of the Foundation Ontology would partially satisfy Feferman's
&gt; representational needs, as expressed in the FOM list Toposy-turvey thread
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9801/msg00164.html">http://www.math.psu.edu/simpson/fom/postings/9801/msg00164.html</A>].
&gt; 
&gt; ____________________
&gt; 
&gt; Here is one possible *path for review* and edit of the Foundation Ontology:
&gt; 
&gt; A. Submit to the SUO list for review, comments and criticisms.
&gt; Beyond set-theoretic critiques, also needed are comments about
&gt; the new KIF and concepts used from Chris Menzel's Basic Ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; B. Ask a select number of category-theorists to review.
&gt; I have in mind the following people:
&gt;     - Ross Street [<A  HREF="http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~street/">http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~street/</A>], a category-theorist
&gt; who seems to have some interest in applications (see his link to Category
&gt; Theory at The Boeing Company, which refers to the Specware software
&gt; mentioned by Michael Uschold [<A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg00375.html">http://suo.ieee.org/ontology/msg00375.html</A>]);
&gt;     - Colin McLarty [<A  HREF="http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/mclarty.html">http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/phil/mclarty.html</A>], who gave
&gt; the challenge topos axioms mentioned above, and has written a topos-theory
&gt; book "Elementary Categories, Elementary Toposes"
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://www.oup-usa.org./docs/0198514735.html">http://www.oup-usa.org./docs/0198514735.html</A>];
&gt;     - Bill Lawvere [<A  HREF="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/">http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/</A>], who is one of
&gt; the primary creators of topos theory, and whose interest in applications
&gt; (although a theorist) is indicated in the very detailed response
&gt; [<A  HREF="http://merwan.sunyerie.edu/~alsani/ctmail01-04,01/msg00014.html">http://merwan.sunyerie.edu/~alsani/ctmail01-04,01/msg00014.html</A>] that he
&gt; gave to a question of Mike Healy's on the category list.
&gt; 
&gt; C. Submit to the category list at large for review, comments and criticisms.

&gt; &gt; Robert,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any further thought of submitting the Foundation Ontology
&gt; &gt; as a starter document in SUO?  As you know, the group needs
&gt; &gt; one or more documents to focus its efforts on.

&gt; &gt; Jim,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Possibly eventually -- not for merger with Ian's effort, but as
&gt; &gt; an alternative approach.  However, the IFF Foundation Ontology
&gt; &gt; is still being worked on, with much feedback from several of
&gt; &gt; the other IFF ontologies such as Spans, Categories, Sets and
&gt; &gt; Classifications (there is a lot of synergism taking place
&gt; &gt; right now).  Although the fundamental idea is reasonably
&gt; &gt; firm, the KIF code (at the ontologos site
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; <A  HREF="http://www.ontologos.org/IFF/IFF.html">http://www.ontologos.org/IFF/IFF.html</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; is still in a flux.  Perhaps in a month or so
&gt; &gt; it will stabilize.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Robert,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I forget if I've already asked you this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this Foundation Ontology something the SUO WG could use
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a starting point to develop a completed SUO document?
&gt; &gt; &gt;  If so, would you like to discuss the option of submitting
&gt; &gt; &gt; this as a starter document.  If so, let's discuss some more.
