May I suggest that the subject of this discussion be "Similar to CYC" or
"Compared to CYC".&nbsp; It is more reflective of my meaning and it is
easy to see that "No better than CYC" could be offensive.&nbsp; I wanted
to highlight the waste of resource involved in creating an equilivent ontology.&nbsp;
Although I would prefer an ontology constructed differently than CYC, I
do not wish to disparage CYC.&nbsp; It is a significant accomplishment.
<p>Many people have criticized CYC and almost everyone would have done
it differently and ( I suspect) different from each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Considering the methods used and the purpose of the ontology, CYC is well
constructed and on a scale different than other ontologies.&nbsp; It works
for CYC - and their customers.
<p>My point is that an ontology created using similar methods will, if
done well, produce similar (but different) results.&nbsp; My prior note
discusses the methods I believe will produce a superior result.&nbsp; Cyc
is sympathetic and has offered their co-operation. They have invested over
15 years and many tens of millions of dollars to develop their ontologies.&nbsp;
However, they are willing to adopt a standard ontology developed in a more
principled way (their caveats are in my previous note).
<p>It seems unlikely to me that a volunteer effort using the same methods
will produce something superior in two to three years.&nbsp; One might
augment or improve CYC and this would be worthwhile, but it is not what
I think most of the contributors to this list have in mind.

Ontology</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><br>I vote NO.
<p>Before commenting on the proposed ontology, I think it worth while to
point out that, in my view, this vote is unnecessary and divisive.&nbsp;
I think it is poor judgment on the part of the chair to call for votes
on his own initiative and without discussion of the wisdom and timing of
such a vote.&nbsp; It puts people in the difficult position of wanting
to be supportive of work being done but having to say the work is not a
satisfactory basis for a long term effort.
<p>This situation could have been avoided by first determining that a vote
was desired by the participants and before calling for a vote,&nbsp; clearly
stating how the vote will be counted.&nbsp; I mean basic things like how
many people are eligible to vote (at this particular time), who the eligible
voters are (name), how the votes will be counted (e.g. does ABSTAIN count
as NO), is a super majority (60%, 75%, etc.) required and how will a percent
YES (or&nbsp; NO) be determined - as a percent of those voting or as a
percent of those eligible to vote - is a quorum required, if so how large
a quorum.
<p>Standards organizations have carefully defined rules about voting.&nbsp;
The rules vary among organizations and situations, but whatever they may
be they are clearly stated.&nbsp; In many cases the rule is 75% of those
eligible to vote and 75% of those actually voting must vote YES (ABSTAIN
does not count as YES).&nbsp; This may or may not be appropriate for this
group, but some clearly stated procedure is required.
<p>Since there have been several statements that the IEEE is silent about
voting procedures in this type of group, as a separate matter I will propose
a set of voting rules for the group's consideration, comments, revision,
etc. If the group can come to a general agreement on a particular procedure,
then I will move that they be formally adopted.
<p>I agree with the technical criticisms offered by Pat Hayes, John Sowa,
Nicola Guarino and others about the specifics of this particular ontology.&nbsp;
I also believe the technique of alignment / merger will not produce an
ontology that will be widely accepted.&nbsp; This is in large measure the
approach taken by Cyc and they have done it reasonably well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A similar approach, if done well, is likely to produce an ontology that
is different , but about as useful as Cyc.&nbsp; If it is done well it
will be costly and it&nbsp; seems to me this would be a waste of considerable
resource.
<p>I am not arguing that Cyc be accepted as "the" standard upper level
ontology - Cyc already is the "standard" to the extent there is one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doug Lenat (Cyc's CEO) offered his co-operation in one of the first messages
posted to this list (I couldn't find this message in the archives).&nbsp;
The Cyc upper level is not what I would prefer as an upper level ontology.&nbsp;
It is what I recommend to clients that need one -- for commercial purposes,
it really is the only game in town.&nbsp; It also has the considerable
advantage of working with Cyc's lower level ontologies.
<p>Doug is willing to convert to a "Standard" if a reasonable one is developed.&nbsp;
I will quote a paragraph from a note I submitted to the list in May that
I am also unable to find in the archives.
<blockquote><i>In previous discussions with Doug, he has been willing to
adopt a standard reference ontology should one emerge.&nbsp; The caveats
are (1) that it is well constructed (2) that it enables Cyc to do things
that it currently cannot or cannot without great difficulty (3) that the
expense of adopting a new upper level be reasonable (4) and that the discernible
advantages to Cyc from (1),(2) &amp; (3) above are not marginal. (-- Doug,
I hope this is an accurate representation of your views.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I
believe this is reasonable and also sets a default as to what is worth
doing.&nbsp; Another upper level ontology about as good as Cyc or somewhat
better would not be</i>
<br><i>worth the scale of investment that I think will be required.</i></blockquote>
The approach that I believe will produce a satisfactory result is along
the lines of Nicola's suggestion that a small group of highly competent
people meet to hammer out a basic philosophical / logical approach as a
foundation for a computational artifact (an upper level ontology)&nbsp;
that will be broadly useful and widely accepted.&nbsp; After (and only
after) such an agreement can be reached,&nbsp; the concepts that have already
been examined, described, defined/partially defined, axiomized, etc. can
be properly placed in the new ontology.
<p>This is not a merger of existing ontologies.&nbsp; It is the creation
of a new ontology -- and where appropriate,&nbsp; using some of the content
of existing ontologies in a principled way.&nbsp; If the concept(s) and
its relation(s) have been considered for use in one ontology, the intellectual
capital this represents is a huge advantage over starting from scratch,
even if the concept is used differently or not at all.
<p>A criticism of this method is that after 2500 years of disputation,
it may seem overly optimistic to expect agreement on basic philosophical
/ logical issues - currently there are strong disagreements among well
known, vividly articulate personalities.&nbsp; My response is to avoid
attempting a resolution of basic philosophical issues by asking for agreement
where possible; when agreement is not possible, compromise on the implementation
of these issues in a way that doesn't do violence to deeply held beliefs.&nbsp;
One is asking for agreement on the design of a computational artifact -
not realism vs nominalism, etc.&nbsp; Newtonian vs relativistic physics
might be useful as an analogy.&nbsp; Although one may know that the universe
operates differently in fundamental ways, Newtonian physics solves the
vast majority of problems encountered in anything like ordinary experience
(including space travel&nbsp; - at least the travel done to date).
<p>A first attempt at this approach was made at the Heidelburg Conference.&nbsp;
This was a private, invitation only conference held at the European Media
Lab located at the Villa Bosch in Heidelburg with generous support from
the Klaus Tschira Foundation - a private German foundation that also supports
the European Media Lab.&nbsp; The theory group was composed of people who
are competent and well known in the field.&nbsp; Among them are some who
have contributed to this list.&nbsp; The participants were chosen both
for their competence and because they are well known to have strongly held
and differing views.&nbsp; The idea being that agreement among them would
have a chance of broad acceptance.
<p>It is an understatement to say that ideas were challenged -- so was
intellectual ability and parentage (among other things), people stormed
in and out of meetings, furniture was broken...&nbsp; After about ten straight
days (of 10 to 12 hour days) an agreement was reached concerning many of
the high level (and most difficult) issues.&nbsp; Much of what was agreed
upon were what factors should be used (or not used) in a factored combinatorial
structure that results in a lattice.&nbsp; This structure is somewhat similar
to Formal Concept Analysis that was mentioned by someone in an earlier
note to this list - however the discussion did not center on category theory
vs set theory, etc.
<p>This work needs to be fleshed out and it takes a serious effort that
cannot be done on a volunteer basis.&nbsp; I am hopeful that funds will
be available soon for this purpose.&nbsp; If so, it will be only a beginning.
<p>Creating a standard upper level ontology - a reference ontology - will
be costly,&nbsp; connecting it up to natural language (common English for
starters) will be very costly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is naive to think otherwise.&nbsp;
It is also naive to think that the proposed merged ontology can serve as
a basis for a standard.&nbsp; However, it is important intellectual capital
that should be encouraged and preserved.
