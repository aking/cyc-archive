Yet Another Recherché Note Of Incunabular Devoir (YARNOID)

Here is an odd lot issue that I don't really have anything
new or webshaking to say about, but it comes to mind through
a coincidence of chance factors, in part because it is one of
the first &quot;Themes from Peirce&quot; that Mary Keeler ever mentioned
to me -- the distinction that Peirce draws between existence and
reality -- in part because even as I was sending you those links
to some old papers of me and mine the other day, Joseph Ransdell's
WSL (WebSlumLord) was perpetrating an act of global brain damage
by changing all of the URL prefixes on the entire Arisbe website!
Trying to avoid screaming at the out(r)age, and following the
consolation of philosophy, I chose to take this as a topic
for theoretical reflection, to wit, that old bone about
signs that do not denote.  So here is an assortment of
classical texts that I submit for your contemplation:

On Telling It Like It Is:
Wit Not A Nonbeing To Be.

| Come, I will tell you -- and you must accept my word when you have heard it --
| the ways of inquiry which alone are to be thought:  the one that 'it is',
| and it is not possible for 'it not to be', is the way of credibility,
| for it follows Truth;  the other, that 'it is not', and that
| 'it is bound not to be':  this I tell you is a path that
| cannot be explored;  for you could neither recognize
| that which 'is not', nor express it.  For it is
| the same thing to think and to be.
|
| Parmenides of Elea, &quot;The Way of Truth&quot;,
| Page 42 in:  Kathleen Freeman (editor),
|'Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers',
| Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1971.

| I now found myself forced by a great many different indications to the conclusion
| that an evolutionary philosophy of some kind must be accepted -- including among
| such philosophies systems like those of Aristotle and of Hegel.  From this point
| the reasoning was more rapid.  Evolution had been a prominent study for half a
| generation;  and much light had been thrown upon the conditions for a fruitful
| evolutionary philosophy.  The first question was, how far shall this evolution
| go back?  What shall we suppose 'not' to be a product of growth?  I fancy it is
| this cautious reflectiveness of my procedure which especially displeases Dr. Carus.
| It is not positivistic:  it is architectonic.  But the answer to the question was not
| far to seek.  If an evolutionary explanation is to be adopted, philosophy, logic, and
| the economy of research all dictate that in the first essay, at least, that style of
| explanation be carried as far back as explanation is called for.  What elements of
| the universe require no explanation?  This was a simple question, capable of being
| decided by logic with as much facility and certainty as a suitable problem is solved
| by differential calculus.  Being, and the uniformity in which being consists, require
| to be explained.  The only thing that does not require it is non-existent spontaneity.
| This was soon seen to mean absolute chance.  The conclusion so reached was clinched by
| a careful reëxamination of the office of chance in science generally, and especially
| in the doctrines of evolution.  Arrived at this point, the next question was, what
| is the principle by which the development is to proceed?  It was a difficult
| inquiry, and involved researches from different points of view.

I think that you can see the link up with the ERROR thread,
but I will endeavor to develop that more clearly over time.

Oh, by the way, here is the new link to our &quot;Integration&quot; paper:
