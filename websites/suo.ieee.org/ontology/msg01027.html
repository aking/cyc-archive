&gt; Dear Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You also wrote:
&gt; &gt; Notice it only arises for entities that are located in space
&gt; &gt; and time: abstract things like sets and numbers are not 
&gt; classified in
&gt; &gt; either of these ways. (Note in particular that a set of physical
&gt; &gt; things is not itself physical.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are you taking physical and abstract as two sides of the same
&gt; &gt; distinction
&gt; &gt; here - or are there more types. It also seems to me that 
&gt; the complete
&gt; &gt; banning of spatio-temporal location for sets can be
&gt; &gt; problematic if you want
&gt; &gt; to think of things such as groups (football teams, and so on)
&gt; &gt; as sets. Some
&gt; &gt; people have suggested this - and ordinary language (for what
&gt; &gt; it is worth) at
&gt; &gt; least supports the view that they have a location ("the
&gt; &gt; English football
&gt; &gt; team was in Hungary last week"). So treating sets as abstract
&gt; &gt; seems to me a
&gt; &gt; choice which blocks off the possibility of treating 'physical
&gt; &gt; groups' as
&gt; &gt; sets.
&gt; 
&gt; MW: Well I certainly don't see the England Football team as a 
&gt; set. I would
&gt; see them as a non contiguous aggregate. So I would have no 
&gt; trouble talking
&gt; about the total weight of the team (as I have said elsewhere 
&gt; - how much does
&gt; a class weigh?).
&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; CP: The issue here is not about how to deal with a particular 
&gt; item, but how
&gt; the item influences the overall architecture. We have a 
&gt; notion of member (of
&gt; a set), which is not transitive. Where we (well, some people) 
&gt; would like to
&gt; somehow say the set of physical things is not itself a 
&gt; physical things. 

MW: Yes I support this.

&gt; We
&gt; also have a notion of part, which is transitive. Where we 
&gt; would like to say
&gt; a whole composed of physical parts is itself physical. 

MW: Yes I support this too.

&gt; We 
&gt; have the notion of
&gt; a member of a group (collection, or whatever), which has 
&gt; characteristics of
&gt; both. 

MW: I don't believe you. This would mean it was both intransitive and
transitive. So whilst people may be switching rapidly between the two
concepts, you can't combine them without a problem.

&gt; Note: we use member of and part of for group - and I am 
&gt; not sure quite
&gt; where the differences lie (and I would be interested in 
&gt; finding out). 

MW: My view is that Group is a word which is used with different meaning in
different contexts. For this reason I have carefully not used it in the work
that I have done, but when encountered would always start by saying "now
when you say group - do you mean aggregate or set?" 

&gt; It
&gt; seems we now have three options:
&gt; 1. Treat groups as sets. This recognizes that 'member of group' is not
&gt; transitive. But we need to drop the intuition that sets are absolutely
&gt; non-located (a difficult intuition to justify for small 
&gt; finite sets). (See
&gt; Max Blacks' "The elusiveness of sets" - The review of 
&gt; Metaphysics, 24, pp.
&gt; 614-36, 1971 - for one description of this position.)
&gt; 2. Treat groups as wholes - then we need a version of part of 
&gt; that is not
&gt; transitive. I may be part of the football team, but my hand 
&gt; certainly is
&gt; not.
&gt; 3. Treat member/part of group as a new kind of relation - and 
&gt; groups etc. as
&gt; a new category of things. This is unattractive for reasons of 
&gt; ontological
&gt; economy (if you like parsimony).
&gt; Matthew chose option 2. 

MW: Lets be clear. I choose 2 for group in this particular context. Give me
another context, I might make a different choice.

&gt; But I am not aware of a sufficiently fine
&gt; distinction here between different kinds of parts. The 
&gt; members of a football
&gt; team seem to be privileged parts in a way in which the parts 
&gt; of a car are
&gt; not. We tend to think of sets having members with a common 
&gt; characteristic,
&gt; this is true of collections. We tend to think of a wholes' 
&gt; parts as having
&gt; different characteristics, the car's engine and bodywork are 
&gt; different kinds
&gt; of things. More importantly the part relation is transitive, 
&gt; but part of
&gt; collection seems not to be. My hand is not a member of the 
&gt; football team in
&gt; a way in which I am.

MW: There are some important principles to understand here about fusion. Let
me explain.

MW: A fusion is some unordered aggregate of members of some "atomic" object
type. So for example, a glass of water is a fusion of water molecules. Water
molecule is the "atomic" level. What this means is that for any aggregate
above the molcular level, the fusion is transitive. When you go below the
molecular level, there is a whole part relation, but it is assembly not
fusion. The atoms of each water molecule are assembled in some sense into
molecules, not roaming around in some soup.

MW: Now let us look at a football team. Here the "atomic" level is a player
(much larger than in our water example). I can have some lower and higher
level fusions than the team. Alower level one could be the forwards, teh
backs, or the midfield. A higher level one could be the squad, or even the
league players. However, as you rightly say, a players hand is below the
atomic level, and is not a direct member of a fusion, but is necessarily
assembled to someone who is.

MW: Finally let us look at car parts. Here Chris says that he problem is
that the parts are not all of the same type. This misunderstands the nature
of the atomic class. It is fine that the elements at the lowest level are
"car parts" they do not all have to be engines, or brakes. So understanding
the class of the atomic object correctly is important.

MW: I think this understanding of fusion resolves all the issues you raise.

&gt; For the record, I am attracted to using either 1 or 2 as the situation
&gt; demands it - both seem to me to be useful, and used. 3 seems 
&gt; unattractive to
&gt; me because it seems to buy you some local simplicity at the cost a
&gt; significantly increasing global complexity. E.g. are collections of
&gt; collections the same type of thing as collections of physical 
&gt; objects - or
&gt; do we have a hierarchy of collections. Is the member of group 
&gt; transitive or
&gt; not? (Probably not - but we need to spell this out.)
&gt; It seems to me that spatio-temporal location (or weight) can easily be
&gt; 'defined' for sets, but make more sense for sets that tend to have a
&gt; coherent spatio-temporal location - up to a certain 
&gt; granularity (as they are
&gt; disconnected). We can say the football team is in London 
&gt; (now) or even in
&gt; this room (now) - depending on how far they are spread out. 

MW: In the sense that the members of the set (in particular the temporal
parts that are members of the set) have a location in common, then this is
fine. But total weight does not work for me. That is transitive.

&gt; For sets such as
&gt; the human race, we might say they are on the planet Earth 
&gt; now, but this
&gt; seems less satisfactory. We can see a similar issue arising 
&gt; for disconnected
&gt; spread out physical objects. If we take masses (as Quine did) 
&gt; as the fusion
&gt; (sum) of all the stuff involved - milk as the fusion of all 
&gt; the bits of milk
&gt; that there are, have been or will be. Then this is a physical object,
&gt; however it has a uninteresting, useless location and weight 
&gt; (particularly if
&gt; we take it as extended over possible worlds). This seems to 
&gt; me to show that
&gt; the issue about spatio-temporal location (and weight) is more 
&gt; linked to
&gt; usefulness and ease of determination, rather than the nature 
&gt; of the things
&gt; itself.

MW: Quite. If you follow the recipe I provide above, you will find that it
works, and you know why you are doing what you are doing.

&gt; Pat Hayes wrote:
&gt; There is a pretty well-investigated subject area of formalisations of
&gt; the notion of 'part', called mereology. It seems clear that the
&gt; set/subset relation and the whole/part relation are intriguingly
&gt; similar in some ways, but also pretty clearly not the same relation,
&gt; no matter what David Lewis thinks. At any rate, one would need to
&gt; make a very strong case to say they were. If you substitute a team
&gt; member, the team has a *different* set of players, yes? If you want
&gt; to say no, then how are you going to talk about what I would call the
&gt; set of players in the team?
&gt; CP: In the case of a configured group, which a football team can be
&gt; interpreted as, we have the positions, which give the team 
&gt; its structure.
&gt; Then substituting a team member, is just changing the person 
&gt; who plays in a
&gt; position. There is the same set - in the sense of the same 
&gt; configutation, it
&gt; is just that one of the positions - a space-time worm - has 
&gt; different people
&gt; occupying different stages at different times. So in a perdurantist
&gt; world-view we can explain what you mean by a different set of 
&gt; players. The
&gt; situation bets more complex when the team's configuration changes over
&gt; time - e.g. you go from a 3-4-3 structure to a 4-4-2 
&gt; structure say (I am not
&gt; a fan of football so these may not be common structures).

MW: The point here is that it is not a matter of choosing BETWEEN  a set and
a fusion, the issue is one of using each APPROPRIATELY.
