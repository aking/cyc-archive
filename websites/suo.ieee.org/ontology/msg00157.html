Graham --

You have jumped on a relatively narrow side discussion about programming
languages and polysemy to advance the argument that you have been
propounding here at some length.  As long as you are on this argument, let
me change the thread, and respond directly to what I think may be your main
thesis.

At one point I thought you were in search of a language that was less
ambiguous than natural language for certain narrowly defined domains that
require a high degree of non-ambiguity.  Now it seems that maybe you have
an expectation that such a constrictive, restrictive and mechanistic
expression vehicle might and should spread to encompass all of human
communication.

If your purpose is the former, I think it would be useful to spell out
(again?) the conditions under which you envision such a mechanism to be
useful and desirable.  The law?  Business transactions?  Courtship?

If you are actually advocating the latter position. you may count me, most
vociferously, among those who oppose your program.  In your note below you
say, "I gather by the silence of many, that they just regard it as fantasy.
"  If you are really proposing your envisioned mechanistic approach for all
human communication, this is not a fantasy.  It is a nightmare.  It is also
not possible, thankfully.

At another time I may take the time to expand on my view of why this is
impossible.  But to put a finer point on the nightmarish aspect of the
broader interpretation (if this is really what you mean), let me quote you
from later in your note, "If I say something to you in a computer language
in which you are literate, you will know exactly what the instructions are,
and how to carry out the functions (assuming you know the
mathematical algorithms involved)."  Surely this can't be your view of the
nature of all and any human communication.  So I'll assume that you have
some narrowly defined domains in mind where it makes sense for people to
communicate this way, and that you may take the time to list a few of them
for us.

Norbert,
     .    Comments interspersed, prefaced "GH&gt;     ".

     .    I am trying to explain a concept that is evidently extremely
foreign to almost all SUO participants. I gather by the silence of many,
that they just regard it as fantasy. That doesn't discourage me from the
conviction that the concept is valid, until someone demonstrates a
logically
provable flaw in the logic of my premise.

     .    It requires absolute rigour by any human wishing to gain the
full precision the approach can provide. Initially, the scope of coverage
will be significantly limited as the cost of that precision. That is the
price one pays for developing an unambiguous language. Extensions to cover
greater scope happen incrementally, and may even require restructures as
new
demands outgrow the capacities of earlier structures. Similar developments
occur over time with most software of advancing sophistication.

Graham

We may have misunderstood each other. Let me try to clarify my point of
view.

At 20:52 +1100 00/12/12, Horn, Graham wrote:
&gt;Norbert,
&gt;    .    I can feel the fuzzy approach you are taking here.

I did not at all intend to advocate the fuzzy approach.

GH&gt;  By "fuzzy", I was referring to the absence of the requirement of any
human for the absolute rigour I mentioned above.

&gt;    .    Nevertheless, if code (and the underlying language) is
&gt;correctly written, the computer will consistently interpret it only one
way,
&gt;and only produce one result (with the exception of random number
generators,
&gt;or programs that involve aspects dependent on previous calculations)

Agreed, but you wrote "if I communicate to you in a computer language in
which you are literate, surely you will understand precisely what I say?"
and I took it that by "you" you meant a human being which is a completely
different situation.

GH&gt;  Yes, I did mean that. If I say something to you in a computer
language in which you are literate, you will know exactly what the
instructions are, and how to carry out the functions (assuming you know the
mathematical algorithms involved). Even if you are a human, this will still
be so.

GH&gt;  I truly believe, especially in restricted frames of reference, that
unambiguous communication is possible between humans (I'm beginning to
think
I'm the only person on the planet who believes that). Certainly I believe
that for any well-formed computer language.

&gt;    .    I am a strong supporter of the (now old fashioned) approach
&gt;of documenting program code, including explanations of the reasonings
behind
&gt;approaches taken.
&gt;
&gt;    .    Yes, that documentation will be ambiguous, but it won't be
&gt;actual code, will it? Therefore, the statement I made won't apply to it.
&gt;
&gt;    .    I am intrigued by amount of weight and emphasis many
&gt;contributions to this project place on what others have said. Such
&gt;contributions seem almost to take the line that the statements must be
right
&gt;because someone else wrote them.

I wish I had formulated Hall's statement because he expresses exactly my
convictions that form an essential part of the philosophy that led to
Attempto  Controlled English.

Please, note that ACE has a dual face: on the one side it is English, on
the
other side a formal language. Thus ACE can play at the same time the role
of
code (formal notation) and commentary (explaining the formal notation in
human terms).

GH&gt;  I understand that, and certainly expect that that would be possible
with any well-formed unambiguous language, whether it borrows from the
formal version of a "natural" language, or whether it is based on a
"logical" symbology.

GH&gt;  I suspect the difference with my approach is that I start from zero,
and build up to a controlled language that has attributes borrowed from a
natural language, while NEVER taking any ambiguous aspect within its own
frame of reference. So long as the user is literate in the controlled
language they will know that there is only one meaning of any word and
grammatical construction.

GH&gt;  I suspect that others start from the whole of the natural language,
and then try to interpret the controlled version from that basis. For
unambiguous communication that approach is prohibited. I suggest humans are
capable of learning to comply with the absolutely rigid rules when
interpreting the controlled version. For example, I am confident that,
given
a calculator with (exactly) the same precision, I could read and follow
some
program code , and come up with the identical answer(s).

GH&gt;  This is crucial to my proposition. If you can accept that, you will
be able to comprehend the feasibility of what I am proposing.

&gt;    .    While I acknowledge that we are in an area that involves
&gt;logical implications, some of which I will be unaware, I prefer statements
&gt;that stand on the basis of well argued logic with demonstrable soundness,
&gt;and I acknowledge refutations demonstrating superior soundness. It may not
&gt;be possible to be black and white, but it should be possible to  at least
be
&gt;extremely dark grey or extremely light grey, with only the slightest tints
&gt;of any colours.

Please recall that we try to formalise domains of the real world that are
not formal at all. It remains our task to relate the formalisation to the
domain (in humanly understandable ways), which as we know cannot be done in
a unique way.

GH&gt;  I agree. However, by starting from zero, one can construct precise
definitions for every word. To start with there will be many things one
just
cannot communicate with the controlled language. Gradually, one will
construct more and more ways of stating more and more different types of
concepts.

GH&gt;  The approach I am suggesting is one requiring absolute rigour and
discipline. Nevertheless, it will make texts generally less ambiguous than
ordinary texts, even to ordinary people, especially as they get to
understand that so many of their alternative interpretations are not valid.
Also, there will be a tendency to avoid those natural language words and
constructions that, in the natural language, are subject to multiple
interpretations.

GH&gt;  Everything you have shown me so far about ACE is able to be
interpreted unambiguously within its own frame of reference, EVEN BY A
HUMAN
WHO KNOWS ITS RULES. This demonstrates exactly the precision that is
required by the sort of controlled language I have always been suggesting.
I
am very impressed with the work you and your team have achieved.

Best regards.
