All,

The other day I reread Chris Swoyer's article on Properties in the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy

   (<A  HREF="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties/</A>)

Swoyer uses the term "property" broadly to cover relations as well as
monadic relations.  I'll stick to that usage in this message as well, since
I think it will be useful to distinguish between ontological entities and
lexical entities, and I don't think the distinction has always been made in
this discussion so far.   I'll use "property" for the former, and
"predicate" for the lexical entity that sometimes corresponds, and avoid
the word "relation" altogether.

Reviewing all the many issues concerning properties, including the issue of
whether or not they exist, makes me think that perhaps Matthew has hit the
nail right on the head with his statement near the end of the message
quoted below:

&gt;
&gt;MW: Well this makes me think that you have a different definition
&gt;of what a relation is to me. This would easily explain how we
&gt;have been missing each other.

Predicates of all arities exist in a standard syntax for predicate logic.
This doesn't imply that properties of any order exist -- that depends on
your ontology.  If I've got this right, one's ontology apparently can
depend on tropes, for example, without admitting the existence of
properties except as bundles of tropes.  (I'm not saying I agree with this,
I'm only saying that apparently some philosophers do).

On the other hand, even supposing you believe in properties, whether or not
triadic properties are needed may depend on what kinds of individuals one
believes in.  To take one of Jon's examples, analysis seems to some people
to necessarily be triadic, because there is an analisand and at least two
analytic components.  It seems to me that this depends on a belief that
each analysis is a triadic or traidic+ property, and thus is a somewhat
circular argument.

On the other hand, if you believe that each analysis is an individual
(could be process, event, occurent, or ?), then you can define a monadic
predicate analysis(X) which is true iff X is an instance of analysis.  Then,
you could believe that there is a dyadic property, analysand, and
another dyadic property analysis_component.  This seems to me to cover
Jon's example, as well as allowing for additional dyadic properties such as
analysis_performer, analysis_epoch, and so on.  The essential three-ness
arises, of course, from the understand of analysis as a 'taking apart', and
would be represented by axioms that say something like "X is an analysis
only if (1) there exists analysand of X, and (2) there exist at least two
analysis_components of X.  'giving' and so on could be treated similarly.

It seems to me that the &lt;emph&gt; engineering issue &lt;/emph&gt; is whether dyadic
predicates can communicate an intended interpretation that is satisfactory
to those who believe that the real underlying property is triadic.

Best regards,

John Velman


PS -- I've quoted slightly more of the previous message below to
give a little context to the quotation.

&gt;&gt; The only residual dross of the matter appears to turn on the

&gt;&gt; that some people cannot yet distinguish a relation from an
&gt;&gt; element of one.
