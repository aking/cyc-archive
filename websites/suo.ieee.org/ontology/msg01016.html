Dear Graham,

Thank you for the query.  I regret that I am late in replying, but I am
able to give this project only limited time under a non-academic
("material interest") rubric. 

I see from your note that I have not been as clear as I would have hoped,
perhaps because the phrase 'reference object' is jargon. It does not stand
for a contentless SUO, however.  To the contrary, it is a way of
facilitating a rich content by sidestepping inevitable areas of
philosophical and methodological difference.  To ask that the final
product be seen as a reference object is to assure that the content be
developed with self-contextualization and self-limitation-- placing its
own design choices in a broader context of methods and specifications.
This is a stronger requirement than internal documentation within the
standard or annexes to it.  The requirement of self-limitation means a
recognition that whatever SUO is developed will be, as Fred Chase has
kindly put it for me in his list of "show-stoppers", neither more nor less
than an "example". If the reference object/example is developed in this
spirit of self-limitation and specification it can be quite useful, and
people can be helpful in developing it without having to commit themselves
to the particular choices made.  On the other hand, if they are asked to
subscribe to design choices of one artifact as if they were the only
reasonable ones, progress would be difficult on the open forum model that
has been chosen;  instead the protagonists of the preferred method would
have to move explicitly to a consortium of like-minded collaborators, or
to try to achieve a similar result by a self-discrediting process of
parrying highly sophisticated methodological and philosophical
reservations with suggestions that the critics be "more constructive" and 
confine themselves to marginal notes on the document at hand. 

To my mind, the weight of experience ('best/existing practice') in the
ontology area argues strongly for a reference object/example approach, and
it is no accident that by my reading nearly all on the NO vote list
and quite a few YES and ABSTAIN voters have tried to suggest that issues
of method be addressed independently of the proposed editing effort on the
proposed "base"  document. 

Frederick Chase has also provided off-line an example of 'Common Criteria'
in securitization protocols that suggest how components of an ontology and
their dependencies can be explicitly pre-engineered to permit users to
rearrange and disable whole sections to serve varying purposes.  

Of course, the difficulty with a reference object approach is that it
requires, concurrent with work on the object/example, a survey of methods
and artifacts that does not now exist, so that it is an "academic" task
that the standard of material interest will not produce without direct
funding well beyond that which sustains the current effort.

Again,  my thanks for your query.


Best,

Lee


PS You asked also, more generally, in a separate email about Cyc's upper
level. My understanding is that the axioms and microtheories that work
around the inevitable inconsistencies are proprietary and that the bare
upper level is of limited use without them.  Theproblem of proprietary
enhancements may also affect other artifacts produced under a commercial
discipline, and I do not believe that the bare IEEE rules on copyright and
patent disclosure adequately anticipate *all* the problems of an upper
level ontology reference object. Note also that the Cyc ontology is honed
for inference not search-- I vaguely (mis?)remember a retrieval rate of
2-5% during HPKB-- so that the issue of "Practical Purpose" raised by
Chris Partridge would have a real bearing on whether a user would wish to
use Cyc or some other upper level.

&gt; 	.	Re: Methodology/Reference Object, I have to declare myself
&gt; as a simpleton. I do not comprehend what it is you are trying to say. Is
&gt; your Point that the SUO should only contain logical and concept management
&gt; material, with information about the nature of concepts, relations, etc.,
&gt; but no concrete content about the world as we know it? 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	If so, my own feeling is that may be paring things down too
&gt; much, a bit like stripping a house down to nothing more than the timber
&gt; frame. That would be pretty useless for providing the most basic role, that
&gt; of shelter. Just as a roof and at least the external walls vastly increases
&gt; the utility of the house, I would suggest that providing some basic
&gt; information about the real world is appropriate for the SUO to give it some
&gt; basic utility.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I vote NO, with the following comments: 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Methodology/Reference Object:  I brought this distinction forward several
&gt; times before to no avail, and others have put it in other ways without much
&gt; traction, but let me try one last time: a crucial conceptual watershed in
&gt; this area (and one that was the agreed 'best practice' and building block of
&gt; the previous ad hoc ontology effort)  is to distinguish the underlying
&gt; methods, architecture, specifications and algorithms of the structure of
&gt; what would be an acceptable upper level from a given instantiation
&gt; determined by specific design and semantic choices.  This latter artefact is
&gt; properly seen as a 'reference object' embodying one version of an underlying
&gt; body of standards.  Several people on this list have further expanded on
&gt; this point by pointing to the possibility of growing and self-maintaining
&gt; ontological structures permitting a variety of users and uses.  These draw
&gt; on methods that go well beyond the merge-and-winnow approach, and cannot be
&gt; adeuqately covered merely by making explicit the 'syntactic' choices and
&gt; axioms of the reference object.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This has been a very useful and lively discussion group, and I, for one,
&gt; have learned from many of the comments. But all that is different from
&gt; producing a standard.  For a successful effort, a synergy between
&gt; institutional arrangements and software design is needed.
