John, 
	.	I realise I've been slow of the mark re CGs. 

	.	How do they relate to the sort of information modelling I am
used to, such as ERDs, BPMs, ORMs, etc? 

	.	Do they enable the sort of visualisation I have been
seeking, and that I believe would assist the needs analysis, development and
assessment of the SUO, whereby the ontology's structure can be represented
in some form of diagrammatic way(s)? 

	.	Is there a possibility to view any of the ontologies we
might consider in the SUO context (whether previous ones like CYC, or recent
ones like David Whitten's Starter ontology) with this approach without
needing specialised software, etc.?

Subject:	ANSI and ISO standards for CGs and KIF


During the past two weeks, the 1999 draft standards for conceptual
graphs (CGs) and the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) have been
revived.  The ANSI standards projects for KIF and CGs, which had been
assigned to the NCITS T2 Committee on Information Interchange and
Interpretation, were inherited by the NCITS L8 Committee on Metadata.

Those projects, which had been lying in limbo for nearly two years,
will now be developed in parallel as ANSI standards (under L8)
and also submitted as new work items for ISO/IEC JTC1 SC32 WG 2.
There will be separate projects for KIF and for CGs, and both will
be developed as international standards for ISO.  The ANSI standards
would be identical to the ISO versions, but with different numbers
on the covers.

From Nov 30 to Dec 2, Chris Menzel hosted a workshop on KIF at
Texas A &amp; M, where about ten of us discussed updates and revisions
to the 1999 draft of KIF and the proposed revisions from the group
for the Standard Upper Ontology (SUO).  The result was a cleaned-up
version of KIF with a simpler core and with proposed modules for
extensions, including a sort hierarchy (which supports the type
hierarchies of CGs and other languages) and metalevel operators
to support import/export to and from other languages (such as CGs,
Description Logics, XML, etc.).

The new version of KIF will simplify the problem of translation
to and from other languages.  It will help CGs in several ways:

 1. The proposed sort hierarchy for KIF will be based on techniques
    designed and implemented in a theorem prover called SNARK by
    Mark Stickel and Richard Waldinger at SRI International:

       <A  HREF="http://www.ai.sri.com/~stickel/snark.html">http://www.ai.sri.com/~stickel/snark.html</A>

    Mark participated in the KIF workshop and explained the sort
    features of SNARK, which supports arbitrary Boolean combinations
    of sorts.  This feature maps very nicely to the recent proposals
    to allow arbitrary Boolean combinations of types in CGs.  Since
    SNARK allows input/output in KIF, it would be possible to translate
    a collection of CGs to KIF, send them to the SNARK theorem prover,
    and translate the results back to CGs.  Anyone who is developing
    theorem provers for CGs directly can also take advantage of the
    SNARK experience, as described on their web site.

 2. The 1999 KIF draft had a large number of options, which were not
    completely independent of one another.  When translating from KIF
    to CGs, it was not clear how many of them had to be supported.
    For the new version, it will only be necessary to provide a
    translation for each feature of the KIF core, since the modules
    that extend the KIF features are defined in terms of the core.

 3. The proposed modules that extend the KIF core are also useful
    for CGs.  The two most important are the sort extensions, as
    descried in point #1, and the metalevel extensions, which are
    needed for many CG applications.  Since the KIF and CG standards
    are being developed in parallel, we can adopt exactly the same
    semantics for both.

Following is the schedule for the ANSI and ISO developments:

 1. At the NCITS L8 meeting, Michael Genesereth and Michael Gruninger
    volunteered to be co-editors of the KIF standard, and I volunteered
    to be the editor of the CG standard.  The three of us had also
    participated in the Texas A &amp; M workshop, and we agreed to continue
    the collaboration in the standards process.  At the L8 plenary
    session on December 8, the committee voted to submit the KIF
    project and the CG project to ISO SC32 in January, 2001.

 2. The next milestone for both projects is to complete new working
    drafts of the KIF and CG standards by the end of December, 2000.
    These drafts will be sent to SC32 in January with the proposals
    for the new work items.

 3. The next L8 plenary session will be held at NIST in Gaithersburg
    at the beginning of March.  Updated versions of the KIF and CG
    standards will have to be finished by the end of February.
    Ideally, all features that go into the final standards should
    be documented in those versions so that any remaining work would
    consist of tidying up the loose ends.  Those versions will also
    be submitted to SC32.

 4. The ISO SC32 meeting will be held in New York City in April, 2001.
    Five countries (including the U.S.) will have to agree to support
    the new work items.  Since there are people in many countries
    who have been using either or both KIF and CGs, it would be
    desirable for them to send a note to the delegates to SC32 from
    their countries and to volunteer to provide whatever information,
    consultation, and/or encouragement that the delegates might need.

There will be more to come.  I plan to send a series of notes to CG
list with proposed updates and revisions to the CG standard.  Anyone
who is using or implementing CG systems should send their comments,
suggestions, and questions to CG list.

John Sowa
