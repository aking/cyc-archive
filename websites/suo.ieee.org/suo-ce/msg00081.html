John, 
.	Wearing my old CE hat, this sounds good. 
. 
.	I have recently been developing some 
verbage working towards developing unambiguous 
language from the other (plain English or 
&quot;Standard English&quot;) end. It was part of a review 
of some data definition standards that used some 
rather obtuse meanings for some very ordinary 
words. 
. 
.	If you are interested, I will get some 
of this (it's not on this machine) to you. 
. 
.

Cheers

&gt; As we discussed in earlier notes, the projects for developing ANSI
&gt; and ISO standards for KIF and CGs have been merged into a project
&gt; for developing a common model-theoretic semantics for KIF, CGs,
&gt; and other notations, including the traditional infix notation for
&gt; predicate calculus.  Members of the CL (Common Logic) project have
&gt; have also been working with other groups to bring other logic-based
&gt; or logic-like notations, such as RDF, under the same semantic umbrella.
&gt; 
&gt; Users and developers of each notation will determine their own
&gt; syntactic conventions, but any semantic features represented in any
&gt; one of the notations could be mapped into the common semantics.
&gt; 
&gt; Following is a note from Nancy Lawler, who attended the ISO meeting
&gt; in Korea, where a NWI (new work item) was proposed to develop a
&gt; CL standard, which would map to KIF, CGs, and other notations.
&gt; 
&gt; The next ISO meeting will be held in January 2003 in Santa Fe,
&gt; New Mexico.  For that meeting, we hope to have well developed
&gt; drafts of the CL standard with mappings to KIF, CGs, and infix
&gt; predicate calculus.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, I will be sending a series of notes to CG list to discuss
&gt; various topics about the standards that were brought up at ICCS 2002
&gt; in Bulgaria.  Philippe Martin has already sent a note to CG list with
&gt; some comments that he raised in the meeting, and I plan to continue
&gt; that discussion in a series of notes to CG list.  I hope that everyone
&gt; who has been using and developing CG systems will participate in that
&gt; disucussion to state their preferences, make suggestions, and help
&gt; to evaluate various proposals.
&gt; 
&gt; We would like to get firm decisions on a number of important issues
&gt; before the end of 2002 so that we can have a definitive statement
&gt; of the latest version for the January ISO meeting in Santa Fe.

&gt; Subject: Common Logic/ KIF/ CG standard: status of proposed NWI
&gt; From: &quot;Nancy Lawler&quot; &lt;nklawler@earthlink.net&gt;
&gt; Date: Thu, 18 Jul 2002 02:25:04 -0400
&gt; To:   &lt;kif@philebus.tamu.org&gt;, &lt;cg@cs.uah.edu&gt;

&gt; TO:   KIF, CG and Common Logic participants
&gt; 
&gt; Hi everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; I regret not making this year's Conceptual Structures conference, but
&gt; I hope there will be some time during its last two days for people to
&gt; discuss the fledgling ISO standardization effort for CGs, KIF and a
&gt; common semantics for them and other representations of logic.
&gt; 
&gt; Attached are two files.  One is an rtf file &quot;ISO WG2 Common Logic&quot;
&gt; derived from the powerpoint slides I used to support a case for adoption
&gt; of a Common Logic/CG/KIF New Work Item at the ISO/IEC TC1 SC32 meeting
&gt; in Seoul in April.  The other is the current draft of the NWI Proposal,
&gt; which I hope you will review.  The NWI proposal is for a 3 part
&gt; standard.  The rationale for separating the parts is that the KIF and CG
&gt; standards are more mature than the Common Logic part, and could proceed
&gt; to Committee Draft status ahead of it.
&gt; 
&gt; The proposal was considered by WG2 (metadata) of SC32, which has several
&gt; members, interested in ontologies for business objects.  The NWI for
&gt; Common Logic had been considered at last year's Toronto meeting, but at
&gt; that time there was no consensus in favor of its adoption.  The WG 2
&gt; chair pointed out that KIF and CGs have been brought up for ISO
&gt; consideration off and on for at least 10 years with never enough help
&gt; available for the editing.  Other members had questions about
&gt; proliferation, redundancy, and whether there is an industrial
&gt; requirement for interoperability that warrants an ISO standard.
&gt; 
&gt; If the Common Logic part of the standard comes together, however,
&gt; this standard may be viewed as a way of managing proliferation of
&gt; logic-related standards, rather than contributing to it.
&gt; 
&gt; For WG 2 to propose a NWI, five countries need to agree to work actively
&gt; on the standard.  Over several days of the Seoul meetings, I engaged in
&gt; formal and informal discussions of related technical, organizational and
&gt; historical issues with the other WG 2 representatives.  Mike Gruninger
&gt; helped me to recruit interested people from England, Japan, and
&gt; Australia, who contacted their WG2 representatives.  Without some
&gt; evidence that there are people within their countries who have a
&gt; requirement for a standard, the members would not have supported the
&gt; proposed NWI.  The Japanese representative supported the proposal on the
&gt; condition that it not be called &quot;Common Logic&quot; since that sounded like
&gt; an attempt to standardize mathematics, which he would not support.
&gt; 
&gt; At the end, there were no countries objecting, and I expect that at
&gt; least the following will support it:  US, Canada, Australia, Great
&gt; Britain, Japan, Korea.
&gt; 
&gt; Jean Berube of Canada and I agreed to be responsible for the standard
&gt; within WG2.  Jean is very experienced in standards work at the ISO level
&gt; and took care of the Petri Net standard for that community.  He also
&gt; participates in SC7, which will be handling OCL.
&gt; 
&gt; I anticipate continuity of funding for my participation in WG2 because
&gt; of US government interest in its 11179 Metadata registry standard, so I
&gt; expect to be able to help with this standard as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Progress will require that the researchers, vendors and developers for
&gt; Common Logic, KIF, CGs (and any other language to be brought in later)
&gt; decide among themselves on what changes they want and convey those to
&gt; the editors in WG2.  None of these groups has a good process for doing
&gt; this now, however, and not enough members of the Conceptual Graphs
&gt; community have paid attention to the Common Logic effort.
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of contentious issues, individuals can also independently
&gt; lobby their country's representatives to SC32, who can comment on draft
&gt; standards during balloting.  WG2 would then be responsible for resolving
&gt; ballot issues and meeting ISO requirements, such as technical quality,
&gt; multilingual interfaces, and coordination with other ISO standards.  The
&gt; recently approved revision of Z, which now includes more detailed
&gt; semantics, will create some coordination requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; The committee did not propose a substitute name for &quot;Common Logic&quot;, but
&gt; agreed that it can be balloted with the name &quot;NWI for CG and KIF
&gt; (provisional title)&quot;.  WG2-SED-024 is the number given the project
&gt; document in WG.  ISO will give it its own number.  After considering any
&gt; issues arising from this note, I'll coordinate with Mike Gruninger and
&gt; John Sowa and give the finished NWI to the WG2 Chair, Larry Fitzwater.
&gt; He stated that he needs the final NWI, and responses from 5 countries
&gt; that they agree on the title and scope, before he'll give it to ISO.
&gt; If all goes well, it would be possible to finish the 90 day balloting
&gt; before the January meeting of SC32 in Santa Fe.
