&gt;         .       I am calling it MRE, because I believe that title is more
&gt;precise. I am happy for people to correct me if I am in error, or to provide
&gt;an even more precise and succinct label, but I believe it is more than just
&gt;controlled. Also, one participant earlier felt "controlled" implied users
&gt;were being restricted in what they wanted to say, rather than just how they
&gt;can express it.

I think we can achieve the latter.

&gt;Subject:        RE: CE Starter grammar
&gt;
&gt;Graham,
&gt;                 I have two concerns
&gt;1.      It is often not possible to determine the purpose of an utterance
&gt;from its surface structure, and in isolation.  I think it will be important
&gt;to keep the distinctions among syntax, semantics and pragmatics.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;     While I agree natural language doesn't avoid ambiguities, I suggest
&gt;we manage the various types of ambiguities as we encounter them. I think we
&gt;will be able to eliminate most of them by developing a few syntactic rules
&gt;forbidding certain constructions. IIrc, ACE has just such rules.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;     I agree we should keep the distinctions among syntax, semantics and
&gt;pragmatics. I don't quite know what structure you are referring to here.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt; Actually, I suspect I will end up wanting additional structural
&gt;distinctions than just the ones you mention. That's because I suspect some
&gt;of the ones I will want will implicitly reflect structures required to be
&gt;explicitly stated in KIF. Naturally we will have to explicitly declare the
&gt;meaning of any such implicit structures.
&gt;
&gt;2.      "process" is likewise an ontological issue rather than a syntactic
&gt;one.
&gt;
&gt;GH&gt;     I don't mind if the label I dubbed "process" is changed, so long as
&gt;the structure and functionality is precise. I think the structure I am
&gt;referring to is really "process word group", which is different to
&gt;"process". Nevertheless, it is also different to "verb". Perhaps you can
&gt;suggest better labels. I mainly care about getting the structure right, tho'
&gt;I believe the labels should not be ambiguous or confusing, and would prefer
&gt;they not be clumsy.

I'm not taking issue with the label names.  I agree that different labels 
for "process" are possible.  I'm addressing a different issue.  Labeling a 
particular verb as a "process" verb, even in a highly restricted grammar, 
may not be possible without doing a "first pass" on a sentence to determine 
which words conform to which parts of speech.

I'm not a computational linguist by trade, but there is a fairly standard 
process for language interpretation that is followed both in restricted 
grammar interpretation as well as true natural language interpretation.  It 
consists of at least two phases.  The first, marks the parts of 
speech.  The second interprets the parse tree to generate the associated 
semantics of the sentence.  There may be other approaches that I'm not 
aware of, but this is the approach I'm assuming.

What I objected to was your providing a grammar - which is a map for the 
allowable parse trees - that included elements that I don't believe can be 
reasonably determined during the parsing phase.  Or, if they were, it would 
result in an overly complex and brittle parser.  By separating things into 
at least these two phases, we get a more tractable problem.  Even in the 
simplest possible programs that you find in prolog textbooks, this two 
phase approach is employed.

As a concrete example, and one that conforms to the ACE grammar, take the 
following two sentences:

The teachers have cats.
All teachers have cats.

and a reasonable translation to logic

(exists (?X ?Y)
   (and
     (instance-of ?X (GroupFn Teacher))
     (instance-of ?Y (GroupFn Cat))
     (possesses ?X ?Y)))

(=&gt;
   (instance-of ?X Teacher)
   (and
     (exists (?Y)
       (instance-of ?Y Cat)
       (possesses ?X ?Y))))

In the first case "teachers" is a "real" plural noun.  It refers to a group 
or set of teachers.  In the second case teachers refers to all 
teachers.  In that case, the same token, "teachers", has a different 
meaning depending upon context.  Even ACE does not eliminate ambiguities of 
this sort because it doesn't need to, they're quite tractable.  This does 
nearly require though that multiple passes be used in order not to 
complicate the grammar unnecessarily.



&gt;I think these labels are fine so long as we acknowledge that they could only
&gt;be added either explicitly by the source of the utterance, or at a stage of
&gt;processing following syntactic parsing.

&gt; &gt;Folks,
&gt; &gt;         .       May I suggest each line of a diagrammatic figure be
&gt;started
&gt; &gt;with a dot, so as to minimise format obliteration by e-mail &amp; firewall
&gt; &gt;systems. I also suggest Courier font for them, to utilise the constant
&gt; &gt;character width of that font. Please note the number of leading dots in the
&gt; &gt;hierarchical indented structures below, in case the indenting is stripped
&gt; &gt;out .
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I also feel we will need a symbology that indicates
&gt; &gt;optionality of elements and structures.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I had a go at some simple augmentations to this, but there
&gt; &gt;are many aspects, of course, to consider. I feel we will rapidly need to
&gt; &gt;expand the paradigm.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       May I suggest we classify sentences , such as:
&gt; &gt;*       purpose:
&gt; &gt;*       .       statement
&gt; &gt;*       .       query
&gt; &gt;*       .       command
&gt; &gt;*       complexity:
&gt; &gt;*       .       simple - only one independent clause
&gt; &gt;*       .       compound - more than one independent clauses only
&gt; &gt;*       .       complex -also has one or more dependant clauses
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I also suggest we break them down into subject, process,
&gt;and
&gt; &gt;possibly indirect object and/or direct object.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Doubtless I sound like an old school master, but I
&gt;strongly
&gt; &gt;suspect we will rapidly require most of the basic traditional grammar
&gt; &gt;elements. Hence I suggest the following enlarged and hierarchical list:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;*       LP = label phrase, of type:
&gt; &gt;*       U = subject,
&gt; &gt;*       I = indirect object, and
&gt; &gt;*       B = direct object; comprising:
&gt; &gt;*       .       L = label
&gt; &gt;*       ..      N = noun
&gt; &gt;*       ..      PN = proper noun
&gt; &gt;*       ..      R = pronoun
&gt; &gt;o       ...     QR = query pronoun [who|what|which]
&gt; &gt;o       ...     (there are other types of pronoun)
&gt; &gt;*       ..      Q = qualifier
&gt; &gt;o       ...     J = adjective
&gt; &gt;-       ....    DJ = determining adjective [the|a|an|all|every]
&gt; &gt;o       ..      JP = adjectival phrase (E + NP, eg: "with the tag")
&gt; &gt;o       ...     JC = adjectival clause (form of simple sentence, but not
&gt; &gt;semantically complete, and introduced by a subordinating conjunction, eg:
&gt; &gt;"which he wore")
&gt; &gt;*       P = process
&gt; &gt;*       .       PP = process phrase
&gt; &gt;*       ..      V = verb (finite)
&gt; &gt;*       ..      AV = auxiliary verb [
&gt; &gt;*       ..      PV = participle verb [
&gt; &gt;*       ..      M = modifier
&gt; &gt;o       ...     A = adverb
&gt; &gt;o       ...     QA = query adverb [how|what|where]
&gt; &gt;o       ...     AP = adverbial phrase (E + NP, eg: "along the wide road")
&gt; &gt;o       ...     AC = adjectival clause (form of simple sentence, but not
&gt; &gt;semantically complete, and introduced by a subordinating conjunction, eg:
&gt; &gt;"when they arrived")
&gt; &gt;*       E = preposition [like|as|...|etc.]
&gt; &gt;*       C = co­ordinating conjunction [and|but|or|...|etc.]
&gt; &gt;*       S = subordinating conjunction [which|how|what|...|etc.]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I'm afraid I can't see any way of avoiding this level of
&gt; &gt;complexity. Fortunately the paradigm is well proven over thousands of
&gt;years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       For our purposes, we get a large task very early on, but
&gt;we
&gt; &gt;can take it incrementally by analysing and specifying each type of
&gt;sentence,
&gt; &gt;starting form the simplest, one at a time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I am using square brackets to indicate optionality below.
&gt;I
&gt; &gt;have also not required optionality to be indicated below the level at which
&gt; &gt;it occurs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       By the way, I am not wedded to the above symbols - they
&gt;were
&gt; &gt;just drawn off the top of my head. We will probably have to assign roles to
&gt; &gt;various characters, so as to make the meaning unambiguous.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Now let's have a go at the simplest generic structure.
&gt; &gt;.          simple statement
&gt; &gt;.        /       |       \  \
&gt; &gt;.       U        P      [I] [B]
&gt; &gt;.       /        |         \/
&gt; &gt;.     LP        PP         LP
&gt; &gt;.   /    \    /    \     /    \
&gt; &gt;. [Q]     L  P      M  [Q]    L
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Suggestions, comments, corrections, criticisms welcome.

&gt; &gt;Folks,
&gt; &gt;I'll suggest the following strawman as a start on a restricted English
&gt; &gt;grammar.
&gt; &gt;                       sentence
&gt; &gt;                      /         \
&gt; &gt;                    SNP|Q         VP
&gt; &gt;                   /    \      /     \
&gt; &gt;                 Det   N|PN    V   NP|SNP
&gt; &gt;                                   / | \
&gt; &gt;                                 Det M N|PN
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;where:
&gt; &gt;SNP = simple noun phrase
&gt; &gt;NP = noun phrase
&gt; &gt;Det = determiner [the|a|an|all|every]
&gt; &gt;N = noun
&gt; &gt;V = verb
&gt; &gt;VP = verb phrase
&gt; &gt;PN = proper noun
&gt; &gt;M = modifier
&gt; &gt;Q = query word [who|what|where]
