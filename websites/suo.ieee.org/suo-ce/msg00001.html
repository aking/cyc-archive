Dear Graham,

I think there are two options to be considered:

1. A minimal grammar and language that is iso-morphic to SUO-KIF, but is
aimed at being human interpretable, along the lines of some of my
translations of KIF into basic English. This would use variables and
probably namespaces much as KIF does/ might do, and would not appear very NL
like, but would be relatively easy to understand.

2. Something ACE like, that aims to maximise the closeness to full natural
language.

I think the former can be done in a relatively straight forward way. You
really just need a translater to and from KIF. I could probably undertake to
prepare a draft of the ebnf (but I'm not sure what the time-scale would be).

For the latter, I see no point in doing something more or less than simply
using ACE. ACE must have an internal format, and this will support FOL.
Again, the interesting thing is whether this can be translated to KIF. My
guess is that some of it can but not all. You could identify a subset of ACE
that does translate to KIF, and make that a conformance class of ACE.

We can pursue either or both of these. My personal view is that we get 80%
of the benefit for 20% of the effort if we follow option 1, and I can see
quite some challenges even there. For example, it seems to me that how you
choose to name relations is important.

Equally I see value in the latter approach too, and whilst I do not have the
energy for it, I would not wish to discourage others.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; Dear SUO-CE protagonists and others, 
&gt; 	.				 	Herewith is 
&gt; Jim's response
&gt; to my questions seeking a way ahead for some form of modified

&gt; 
&gt; 	.	At this stage, I have not had replies from

&gt; 
&gt; 	.	What does everyone feel? 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Please pass this on to anyone else you know of 
&gt; who may be
&gt; interested in progressing this matter.

&gt; 
&gt;  Graham,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I feel we have identified a subgroup within the SUO 
&gt; participants who can
&gt; see the feasibility of some form of modified / restricted 
&gt; English language
&gt; for the SUO, but not progressed beyond that stage. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is fully appropriate for you to have pursued this concept.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	.	I did, however, get the impression that all 
&gt; work on the SUO
&gt; to date was voluntary, on the basis of time contributed by 
&gt; ourselves and the
&gt; institutions we represent.  
&gt; 
&gt; This is true.  This is how standards groups work.  Memebers 
&gt; with an interest
&gt; raise their own resources and contribute to the development 
&gt; of the standard.
&gt; If funding came from a central source, that would corrupt the voting
&gt; process.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	.	If I am right, then it sounds like any form of 
&gt; modified /
&gt; restricted English for the SUO is limited to whatever options 
&gt; are available
&gt; with ACE and its development path. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	.	I believe we have to determine the options open 
&gt; to us, and
&gt; which are acceptable to us. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Jim, 
&gt; .	Am I on track here? 
&gt; &gt; It appears so.  You have a solution you believe in and are 
&gt; seeking the
&gt; resources to make it happen. This is what makes standards 
&gt; development work.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	.	Are there any financial resources available to 
&gt; the project,
&gt; and if so, on what bases?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is a fair question.   However, IEEE never centrally 
&gt; funds standards
&gt; development.  They don't have the funding sources and they 
&gt; would have no way
&gt; of picking the best investments.  
&gt; However, there are various ways to resource this project.  
&gt; Here are a few I
&gt; can think of.
&gt; 1.	First analyze what you really need.  Is it expertise (limited
&gt; amounts can come from volunteers), highly skilled labor 
&gt; intentive work,
&gt; lower skilled (that a grad student could do) labor intentive 
&gt; work, pilot
&gt; projects, software development, trial implementations, etc.  
&gt; Don't just
&gt; assume you need a lot of money.  A true champion finds ways 
&gt; to scrounge
&gt; resources (people, money, etc.) and make progress in small steps.
&gt; 2.	You could approach someone who already has funding in 
&gt; this area and
&gt; see if they will channel some into this subproject.  Many R&amp;D 
&gt; projects have
&gt; flexibility to invest in the best subprojects.
&gt; 3.	You could build a project team and submit proposals.  You could
&gt; fully and openly use the SUO-CE list to discuss efforts to 
&gt; seek resources.
&gt; 4.	I suggest you make whatever progress you can with volunteer
&gt; resources.
&gt; The more progress you make, the more volunteers you'll attract and the
&gt; better your chances of finding resources.
&gt; Hope this helps.
&gt; Jim

&gt; 
&gt; John,  
&gt; 	.	Thanks for this. I had wondered where such 
&gt; basic commodities
&gt; had gotten. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	As you can gather, I am looking to draw the 
&gt; issue of a more
&gt; natural and familiar representation of the SUO to some form 
&gt; of decision
&gt; point. I feel we have identified a subgroup within the SUO 
&gt; participants who
&gt; can see the feasibility of some form of modified / restricted English
&gt; language for the SUO, but not progressed beyond that stage. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I did, however, get the impression that all 
&gt; work on the SUO
&gt; to date was voluntary, on the basis of time contributed by 
&gt; ourselves and the
&gt; institutions we represent. In particular David Whitten's work seems a
&gt; particularly valuable contribution, so it seems "SUO-KIF" 
&gt; does not have this
&gt; problem, or at least not to anywhere near the extent.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Furthermore, I thought this basis fitted in with the
&gt; discussion about the SUO being freely available - at no cost 
&gt; to users. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	If I am right, then it sounds like any form of 
&gt; modified /
&gt; restricted English for the SUO is limited to whatever options 
&gt; are available
&gt; with ACE and its development path.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim, 
&gt; 	.	Am I on track here? If not please let me know 
&gt; where I am in
&gt; error. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Are there any financial resources available to 
&gt; the project,
&gt; and if so, on what bases? I realise this could have a 
&gt; somewhat involved
&gt; answer, relating to institutions that may be approached to 
&gt; fund such work,
&gt; but I was just thinking of an overview at this stage. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Norbert, 
&gt; 	.	Under what circumstances and conditions would ACE be
&gt; available for the SUO? 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I gather that the code of the parser would remain
&gt; confidential to some organisation. Uni of Zurich? But what 
&gt; about the rest?
&gt; In particular, would people be able to access a comprehensive
&gt; list/specification enabling them to write compliant code if 
&gt; they followed
&gt; it? Would this require the outlay of money, or could they get 
&gt; it gratis,
&gt; say, from a web site, like many other languages, etc. (eg. HTML)?  
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	What would apply regarding upgrades? Also, what are the
&gt; mechanisms for contributing issues and suggestions to the 
&gt; list of items
&gt; awaiting development 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Graham,
&gt; 
&gt; There is one simple thing that can make any or all of these
&gt; options possible:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Where can we go from here? Options I see are: 
&gt; &gt;*	someone is found who has the knowledge, experience and energy to
&gt; &gt;take on the work, much like David Whitten has done with SUO-KIF; 
&gt; &gt;*	some arrangement is arrived at with Norbert for both 
&gt; use of ACE and
&gt; &gt;its extension; or 
&gt; &gt;*	we drop the proposal, as something unable to be researched. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;	What do you feel?
&gt; 
&gt; The simple ingredient that gives people the "energy to take
&gt; on the work" or to "arrive at an arrangement" is money.
&gt; 
&gt; With it, the project can be done.  Without it, not.
&gt;
