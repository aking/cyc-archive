Graham,
   I was making more of a suggestion for the future.  I don't think we do 
have much from the past where crisp sentences also reference SUMO terms.

&gt;Graham,
&gt;    In whatever time you do have available, we might still be able to make
&gt;progress with a sort of informal restricted English.  As long as you use
&gt;terms from SUMO which are still consistent with their definitions, folks
&gt;that are more conversant with logic could translate them.  That might also
&gt;have the benefit that as you see your sentences translated, you may pick up
&gt;logic, much as watching foreign TV with subtitles can be a way to learn a
&gt;new language.  My statements about &quot;Joe's arm&quot; were a sort of restricted
&gt;English.

&gt; &gt;         .               I agree there is a need for a formalisation for
&gt;this
&gt; &gt;principle. What's more, you are correct in implying that this is a very
&gt; &gt;important aspect.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Unfortunately, I am not up on the logic practices well
&gt; &gt;enough to be able to suggest which formalisations comply with current
&gt; &gt;standard approaches, and would need to put quite a few hours into studying
&gt; &gt;the area in order to come up with one. I'm afraid I just don't have the
&gt;time
&gt; &gt;to do this, much as I would, in an ideal world, love to take it on and be
&gt; &gt;employed in such an area.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       All I can volunteer at this stage is that I see this as
&gt; &gt;another of the principles I see as part of a sound approach, along with my
&gt; &gt;recent contributions about metaphor and breaking categorisations down into
&gt; &gt;orthogonal conceptual structures. (I'll try to find the contributions, and
&gt; &gt;attach them at the bottom, separated by double rows of +++++++++++++s.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Basically,  my thoughts about information management over
&gt; &gt;the decades have come to a view that we can usually make most progress by
&gt; &gt;exploiting the principles and devices human­ and animal­kind have devised
&gt; &gt;and evolved over the past few million years. (Actually it's much longer
&gt;than
&gt; &gt;that, as some of them I observe in reptiles and even arthropods.) These
&gt;have
&gt; &gt;evidently already withstood considerable tests of time, and so are
&gt; &gt;demonstrably quite robust.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       The ones I mention above are some of the more useful ones
&gt;I
&gt; &gt;see for this stage of development. Others will be appropriate in the more
&gt; &gt;esoteric areas I hinted at below, but also include the evolution of
&gt;emotions
&gt; &gt;and emotional responses.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       So, I suggest the best approach is to mimic how the
&gt; &gt;principles I suggested are most consistently, logically and successfully
&gt; &gt;implemented among various societies of the genus of Homo Sapiens Sapiens.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Incidentally, with a bit of thought, you should be able to
&gt; &gt;see from this why I was such a strong advocate of a modified and restricted
&gt; &gt;version of English for the project. That's also part of the same principle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Sorry I can't give a more nuts and bolts answer.

&gt; &gt;Dear all,
&gt; &gt;         .         Let me suggest a conceptual approach for looking at
&gt;this,
&gt; &gt;and many other problematic areas in development of practical ontologies for
&gt; &gt;everyday use.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       The fact is, of course, that the world is quite
&gt;complicated.
&gt; &gt;Naturally there are issues like the longevity of items (3­D vs 4­D), when
&gt; &gt;all physical objects transform over time, not to mention issues like
&gt; &gt;time­space etc.  Also, there are issues of purity, corrosion, deformation
&gt; &gt;form the ideal shape and so forth. And I haven't even touched on more
&gt; &gt;esoteric areas like reasoning and motives, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       The nature of human endeavour is evidently that mankind
&gt; &gt;makes hypothetical models about the universe that seem to explain
&gt; &gt;observations and facilitate planning, etc. We then modify these, generally
&gt; &gt;to more complicated models, as shortcomings are found in the earlier ones.
&gt; &gt;Of course some, such as Phlogiston being replaced by Oxygen, are abandoned
&gt; &gt;as erroneous. Others, such as the geological principles of vulcanism,
&gt; &gt;sedimentarianism and metamorphism, are incorporated side by side, once
&gt; &gt;recognised as portions of an overarching system rather than the competing
&gt; &gt;alternatives they were originally seen to be.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Furthermore, the earlier and simpler models often provide
&gt; &gt;convenient approximations that suit many purposes. Newtonian physics is a
&gt; &gt;classic example used by most engineers, even though we know the truer model
&gt; &gt;is Einsteinian. Classical chemistry vs nuclear physics vs quantum physics
&gt;is
&gt; &gt;another.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       So, I suggest that the ontology, to be practically useful,
&gt; &gt;will need to accommodate approximation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I suggest the above little word picture as an initial
&gt; &gt;suggestion for a basis for this. I would be happy for it to be modified,
&gt; &gt;corrected, etc, by what the group feels makes it more accurate and/or
&gt; &gt;practical.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Again, at the risk of attracting the vehement ire of some
&gt; &gt;participants, what do others think?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Chris and Adam,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is another of the very many reasons why the goal of a monolithic
&gt; &gt;ontology is hopeless:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I never suggested - or hoped I did not - that there was a simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; single answer to this question. Philosophers will be arguing about
&gt; &gt; &gt; this for decades - they have a vested interest in doing so - and
&gt; &gt; &gt; one of the standard arguments will be that the distinction is
&gt; &gt; &gt; misguided. My point is that the issue is well enough understood to
&gt; &gt; &gt; recognize some of its important features - one of which is that there
&gt; &gt; &gt; are serious problems in having a single consistent way of talking
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 3D and 4D - along with a variety of other metaphysical
&gt; &gt; &gt; positions. And that deciding on these points is a particularly
&gt; &gt; &gt; important aspect of any top ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I believe that there are strong arguments for both sides (and maybe there
&gt; &gt;are even more than just 2 options on this and many related issues).  The
&gt; &gt;lattice of all theories very nicely accommodates all of these views; it can
&gt; &gt;show exactly what axioms are common to both, and what axioms are
&gt; &gt;contradictory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;All the effort spent in arguing over these issues could have been much more
&gt; &gt;profitably spent in making a clean division of the axioms for both
&gt; &gt;approaches and giving developers a choice.

&gt; &gt;Subject:        RE: Foundations for ontology
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;John,
&gt; &gt;         .       In my previous response I inadvertently omitted the word
&gt; &gt;&quot;more&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I have had a chance to go through the presentations at
&gt;home
&gt; &gt;last night.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I see a major shortcoming in the lack of preparedness to
&gt; &gt;accommodate more sophisticated meaning analyses and interpretations. In
&gt; &gt;particular, most of the examples of multiple meanings you quoted amounted
&gt;to
&gt; &gt;metaphorical ones.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I realise that having an information processing paradigm
&gt; &gt;that separates out the metaphorical applications implies processing, rather
&gt; &gt;than just database access. Nevertheless, it greatly simplifies the basic
&gt; &gt;vocabulary. With computer power ever expanding, I suggest that processing
&gt; &gt;can be accommodated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       The advantage is that most word have only a single basic
&gt; &gt;meaning, and the application of metaphor is then assessed separately.
&gt; &gt;Furthermore, I suggest there aren't overly many common metaphorical
&gt; &gt;transmutations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       This is a bit like my criticism of your examples of
&gt; &gt;conceptual graphs many months ago, whereby I felt you weren't breaking the
&gt; &gt;options down by fundamental and orthogonal categories. If one does apply
&gt; &gt;such information management approaches, the task is significantly
&gt; &gt;simplified, though it does require assessment by logical thinkers, rather
&gt; &gt;than just anybody. (I have included my e­mail on this below yours). I feel
&gt; &gt;that in part, because the CG I commented on then is the same as in your two
&gt; &gt;latest papers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Furthermore, I suggest orthogonal analysis, including
&gt; &gt;separation of basic and metaphorical meanings, lends itself to automation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       I feel significant leverage is being lost through lack of
&gt;a
&gt; &gt;willingness to undertake this sort of systematic analysis.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       For you to ponder and possibly respond.

&gt; &gt;It is evidently significant and perspicacious.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;         .       I believe we would be well served by considering our way

&gt; &gt;Subject:        SUO: Foundations for ontology
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As I have said in many notes to SUO list, I have some concerns about any
&gt; &gt;ontology that is developed by hand.  In two recent talks, I presented my
&gt; &gt;views of how ontologies should be developed.  The first talk, which I
&gt; &gt;presented at ICCS on August 3, surveys the philosophical foundations.
&gt; &gt;Following are the slides:

&gt; &gt;&lt;<A  HREF="http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/signtalk.htm">http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/signtalk.htm</A>&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The second talk, which I presented at an IJCAI workshop on knowledge
&gt; &gt;discovery on August 6, suggests automated or semiautomated methods of
&gt;aiding
&gt; &gt;in ontology development.  Following are the slides for that talk:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    <A  HREF="http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/autotalk.htm">http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/autotalk.htm</A>
&gt; &gt;&lt;<A  HREF="http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/autotalk.htm">http://www.jfsowa.com/pubs/autotalk.htm</A>&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I had originally intended to make this one talk, but as it kept getting
&gt; &gt;longer, I split it in two.  There will also be a paper, which I'll announce
&gt; &gt;later (when it is finished).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;At IJCAI, I also attended a talk by Stuart Shapiro.  The paper for that
&gt;talk
&gt; &gt;included some comments about Cyc, which are very relevant to ontology
&gt; &gt;development by hand.  The problems with keeping Cyc consistent indicate why
&gt; &gt;I believe that more autotmated and semiautomated tools are essential for
&gt; &gt;ontology development. I scanned the paragraphs about Cyc from the paper and
&gt; &gt;included them at the end of this note.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As I said at the SUO workshop at IJCAI, I believe that something along the
&gt; &gt;lines that Robert Kent has been proposing for IFF is a necessary component
&gt; &gt;of any ontology project.  I would prefer to see SUMO split up into multiple
&gt; &gt;smaller theories that could be combined by belief revision methods.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;John Sowa
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;                       Some Observations about Cyc
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;[The following comments on Cyc have been extracted from a paper that was
&gt; &gt;presented by Stuart Shapiro at an IJCAI Workshop (citation below). The
&gt; &gt;evaluation of Cyc is based on Cycorp documentation and on experience by the
&gt; &gt;first author (Frances Johnson) during a Cyc training course.]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Doug Lenat and Cycorp have developed Cyc [Cycorp, 200la] -- a large
&gt; &gt;knowledge base and inferencing system that is built upon a core of over a
&gt; &gt;million hand-entered assertions or rules about the world and how it works.
&gt; &gt;This system attempts to perform commonsense reasoning with the help of this
&gt; &gt;large corpus of beliefs (mostly default with some that are monotonic).  It
&gt; &gt;divides its knowledge base into smaller contexts called micro­theories
&gt;which
&gt; &gt;contain specialized information regarding specific areas (such as troop
&gt; &gt;movement, physics, movies, etc.).  Belief revision is performed within
&gt; &gt;micro­theories or within a small group of micro­theories that are working
&gt; &gt;together, and the system is only concerned with maintaining consistency
&gt; &gt;within that small group (as opposed to across the entire belief space).
&gt;For
&gt; &gt;example:  in an everyday context, a table is solid, but within a physics
&gt; &gt;context, it is mostly space  (between atoms).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A belief can have only one truth value, so no microtheory can contain both
&gt;p
&gt; &gt;and ~p.  For example, ~p could be expressed as the proposition p with a
&gt; &gt;truth value of false.  The technique for maintaining consistency is to
&gt;check
&gt; &gt;for contradictory arguments whenever a proposition is derived or asserted
&gt; &gt;into a microtheory.  When contradictions are found, their arguments are
&gt; &gt;analyzed, and a decision is made regarding the truth value of the
&gt; &gt;propositions involved.  Rankings of beliefs, however, is not a part of the
&gt; &gt;system -- it uses specificity to determine the truth value of a default
&gt; &gt;belief.  For example:  Opus the penguin does not fly, even though he is a
&gt; &gt;bird, because penguins don't fly.  If there can be no decision based on
&gt; &gt;specificity, the truth value of the default belief is unknown.  A default
&gt; &gt;belief loses out to a monotonic one.  And, lastly, according to Cyc
&gt;trainers
&gt; &gt;and other contacts, contradictions that are purely monotonic bring the
&gt; &gt;system to a halt until they are fixed.  During Cyc training, Johnson
&gt; &gt;attempted to prove this last statement and failed -- revision was
&gt;performed.
&gt; &gt;The instructors were surprised, but thought the training interface might be
&gt; &gt;the cause.  We plan to explore this further, but it is an example of a
&gt; &gt;system behaving differently than it is described.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As mentioned [above], Cyc did not perform as described, and there must be
&gt; &gt;some question as to other possible differences from design theory. Most
&gt; &gt;specifically, Cyc literature [Cycorp, 2001b] claims to keep the
&gt; &gt;micro­theories consistent, for lack of a better word.  When asked, contacts
&gt; &gt;agreed that, in spite of a cursory check, it was possible that unknown
&gt; &gt;contradictions might exist that had not, yet, been derived.  In this sense,
&gt; &gt;Cyc can only guarantee that its microtheories are not known to be
&gt; &gt;inconsistent (or KS-consistent).  Ideal terminology, such as consistent and
&gt; &gt;derivable, is often not appropriate for use with a large or complex
&gt; &gt;implemented system.

&gt; &gt;Subject:        SUO: Ontology Structure &amp; Content
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;John,
&gt; &gt;         .       Your mention of lattices at the bottom of your e-mail
&gt;below
&gt; &gt;prompted me to return to your &quot;Mathematical Background&quot; at
&gt; &gt;www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm
&gt; &gt;&lt;<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/misc/mathw.htm</A>&gt; . I continue to be frustrated
&gt; &gt;at the apparent lack of comprehension by anyone in the SUO group at what I
&gt; &gt;have been speaking of as &quot;conceptual dimensionality&quot; and the like.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Taking your Section 7, I see something close to what I am
&gt; &gt;addressing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Basically, I would group Erdmann and your beverage types
&gt;in
&gt; &gt;a different way. The basic attributes I see are:
&gt; &gt;*       temperature,
&gt; &gt;*       constituents:
&gt; &gt;*       minerals,
&gt; &gt;*       plant extracts:
&gt; &gt;*       leaf,
&gt; &gt;*       fruit,
&gt; &gt;*       bean,
&gt; &gt;*       wood,
&gt; &gt;*       bark, and
&gt; &gt;*       root,
&gt; &gt;*       animal extracts:
&gt; &gt;*       meat, and
&gt; &gt;*       milk,
&gt; &gt;*       brewed extracts:
&gt; &gt;*       alcohol, and
&gt; &gt;*       bacilli; and
&gt; &gt;*       &quot;aeration&quot;:
&gt; &gt;*       &quot;fizz&quot;, and
&gt; &gt;*       froth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       This provides a far more comprehensive structure, without
&gt; &gt;even ranging beyond the beverages you mentioned other than to add the
&gt; &gt;logical additional alternatives. It allows further elaboration, such as
&gt;from
&gt; &gt;what species the extracts derived, and what particular extract compositions
&gt; &gt;are involved. It would thus more readily accommodate such beverages as
&gt; &gt;cappuccino, cocoa, soy milk, Irish coffee, kava, Bovril, yoghurt and so on,
&gt; &gt;even flat beer and champagne.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       This involves breaking things up into logical groups that
&gt; &gt;are independent of each other, and goes into multiple layers of depth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       The next problem comes when one begins looking at various
&gt; &gt;perspectives. For example some people may wish to look at stimulant
&gt; &gt;categories, and wish to group caffeine and taeine together even though one
&gt; &gt;is a bean extract (coffee, cola, etc), and the other a leaf extract (tea).
&gt; &gt;(Alternatively, sugar can be either a wood or root extract.) So, does one
&gt; &gt;break down along the above structure - in which the next level would be the
&gt; &gt;species of plant from which the stimulant derived, or should one go
&gt;directly
&gt; &gt;from the next higher level, and then branch directly into extract types?
&gt; &gt;Even with this simple example, one can get different structures for such a
&gt; &gt;reason.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       However, this structural difficulty can be reduced if one
&gt;is
&gt; &gt;prepared to allow multiple branchings. For example, the constituents
&gt; &gt;category above could instead be broken directly down into chemical
&gt; &gt;categories (eg. some plant extracts are actually minerals, and some
&gt; &gt;biologically based industrial processes deliberately exploit such an
&gt; &gt;approach). This would be able to be visualised as the second branching
&gt; &gt;coming off the page at right angles, because the issue of chemical
&gt; &gt;composition is conceptually independent of the issue of extraction source.
&gt; &gt;The two issues are conceptually &quot;orthogonal&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Please note that this approach does not inherently
&gt;simplify
&gt; &gt;the whole universe into a nice easy to read structure. After all, most
&gt; &gt;beverages are artificial, and we are really breaking out portions of the
&gt; &gt;ontologies (is this term appropriate here?) of the animal, plant and
&gt;mineral
&gt; &gt;kingdoms, etc., at our convenience. Really we should have developed those
&gt; &gt;more fundamental ontologies, and then chosen to exploit them and their
&gt; &gt;structures for this beverage classification exercise.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       But I hope this shows some of the power I suggest we can
&gt;be
&gt; &gt;using to structure and populate the SUO in a reasonably optimal way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;         .       Reactions welcomed (Gees, I must be a masochist, going by
&gt; &gt;the previous reactions I have gotten with this project).

&gt; &gt;Subject:        RE: SUO: More KIF-ified Ontology Content
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Matthew and Pat,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I believe that you have both made some very important points.  Rather than
&gt; &gt;criticizing the ideas I don't fully agree with, I will comment on some that
&gt; &gt;I like very much.
&gt; &gt;Then I'll present my preferred way of viewing things, which allows for
&gt; &gt;multiple viewpoints to coexist (even when they couldn't be simultaneously
&gt; &gt;asserted without contradiction).
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: It is my experience that indeed the things people argue about the
&gt;most
&gt; &gt; &gt;are at the highest levels, where as the day to day things people find
&gt; &gt;easier
&gt; &gt; &gt;to agree on, because we can point at things to see whether we mean the
&gt;same
&gt; &gt; &gt;thing or not. So for example, I doubt if any difficulty we might have on
&gt; &gt; &gt;agreeing what we meant by &quot;red&quot; would have anything to do with whether we
&gt; &gt; &gt;saw it as a property, that things could take up, or as a class whose
&gt; &gt;members
&gt; &gt; &gt;were states, either individuals, or temporal parts of individuals. I
&gt;would
&gt; &gt; &gt;expect the discussion to be around where the border was between red and
&gt; &gt; &gt;other adjacent colours. So &quot;red&quot; can fit into different frameworks with
&gt; &gt; &gt;different ways of understanding what being red means.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is a very clear statement of a position, which I agree with, but which
&gt; &gt;is more often expressed in a more muddled way, which I don't agree with.
&gt; &gt;The simpler, more muddled, and to my mind, more dangerous way is the
&gt; &gt;following:
&gt; &gt;It is easier for people to agree on the lower-level concepts than on the
&gt; &gt;higher-level ones.  Therefore, the high-level concepts aren't important,
&gt;and
&gt; &gt;it doesn't matter if we haven't done a good job on the top levels.
&gt; &gt;The point where I stop agreeing in such an enthusiastic way is at the next
&gt; &gt;sentence:
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: I would further expect
&gt; &gt; &gt;to be able to translate between the different frameworks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Pat has stated my concerns very nicely:
&gt; &gt; &gt;PH: Obviously the interesting case is where they are referring to
&gt; &gt; &gt;different concepts. But the difficult case is where A's concept
&gt; &gt; &gt;cannot even be expressed in B's overall ontological framework, and
&gt; &gt; &gt;vice versa.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I also like Pat's succinct summary of an important distinction, which I use
&gt; &gt;as one of the top three in my top-level ontology:
&gt; &gt; &gt;PH: In the
&gt; &gt; &gt;continuant/occurent way of thinking, one refers to existence *at a
&gt; &gt; &gt;time*. This means that the four-dimensional entities simply do not
&gt; &gt; &gt;exist in this ontology. A continuant is something which continues to
&gt; &gt; &gt;exist through time and retains its identity through time, and is such
&gt; &gt; &gt;that (this is the characterising property) all its parts are present
&gt; &gt; &gt;whenever it is present. Thus a person is a continuant, since if I am
&gt; &gt; &gt;here then all my parts are here (now), while a race, say, is not a
&gt; &gt; &gt;continuant - it is in fact an occurrent - since it has parts which
&gt; &gt; &gt;are temporally distinguished: it has a beginning, a middle and an
&gt; &gt; &gt;end. The distinction is like that between a person (a continuant) and
&gt; &gt; &gt;that person's life (an occurrent).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;And this is a good summary of the problem:
&gt; &gt; &gt;PH: Both occurrents and continuants 'map' into 4-d entities in the 4-d
&gt; &gt; &gt;histories ontology, but there is no principled way there to
&gt; &gt; &gt;distinguish them. The nearest you can get is to say that continuants
&gt; &gt; &gt;have isotemporal parts while occurents have isospatial parts, but in
&gt; &gt; &gt;the 4-d histories ontology one can cut 'parts' any way one chooses,
&gt; &gt; &gt;including along boundaries which slant in time (ie which are
&gt; &gt; &gt;'moving', as someone who thinks non-4-dimensionally would say.) And
&gt; &gt; &gt;the defining criteria for the distinction in the other ontology is
&gt; &gt; &gt;literally incoherent in the 4-d ontology, since *nothing* is such
&gt; &gt; &gt;that all its parts are present whenever it is present: the 'whenever'
&gt; &gt; &gt;here is meaningless in the 4d ontology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;As evidence for the idea of a continuant in intuitive thinking,
&gt; &gt; &gt;consider the claim that I am the same person I was 10 years ago. This
&gt; &gt; &gt;is literally false in the 4-d ontology (it can be expressed there by
&gt; &gt; &gt;saying that me-now and me-1990 are both slices of the me-history, but
&gt; &gt; &gt;that raises the question of what distinguishes one history from
&gt; &gt; &gt;another, since these are also both slices of completely unrelated
&gt; &gt; &gt;histories) Statements like this seem to depend on the idea of
&gt; &gt; &gt;something retaining its identity through time, even though its
&gt; &gt; &gt;properties may change. This 'locus of identity' is what constitutes
&gt; &gt; &gt;the basic idea of a continuant, I think.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;To summarize:
&gt; &gt;1.      Pat says that the 4-D viewpoint allows ways of cutting up the
&gt; &gt;universe that cannot be mapped into the viewpoint of 3-D plus time.
&gt; &gt;2.      Matthew points out that it is easier to map the 3-D plus time
&gt; &gt;viewpoint into the 4-D viewpoint.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree with both, but only with the caveat that &quot;easier&quot; does not imply
&gt; &gt;&quot;possible to translate each and every distinction that anyone would ever
&gt; &gt;want to make.&quot;
&gt; &gt;         &gt;&gt;MW: Until recently I used as my baseline a viewpoint that said
&gt; &gt;that there
&gt; &gt;         &gt;&gt;were individual things like you, my car, classes, and
&gt; &gt;associations, where
&gt; &gt;         &gt;&gt;an association is a relationship that understands that it lasts
&gt; &gt;for a period
&gt; &gt;         &gt;&gt;of time. I have moved to a 4D approach, replacing individual
&gt; &gt;things with
&gt; &gt;         &gt;&gt;spatio-temporal extents, and associations with timeless
&gt;relations.
&gt; &gt;However,
&gt; &gt;         &gt;&gt;I know very well how to take something from my old model and
&gt; &gt;represent it
&gt; &gt;         &gt;&gt;in the new model, and vice-versa.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But Pat points out the problem some distinctions vanish in the 4-D
&gt;ontology,
&gt; &gt;and I agree:
&gt; &gt; &gt;I wonder if you really can do this, if you think hard about it. Ive
&gt; &gt; &gt;been living within a 4-d ontology for a long time and mapping other
&gt; &gt; &gt;ontologies to it, and what I find is that many distinctions simply
&gt; &gt; &gt;vanish, rather than being 'translated'. This is fine with me, of
&gt; &gt; &gt;course, but it tends to get the other folk a little upset, especially
&gt; &gt; &gt;when they have written entire books about these distinctions. And in
&gt; &gt; &gt;the other direction, I find that perfectly reasonable-seeming things
&gt; &gt; &gt;in my ontology, like 'moving' (sloping in space/time) boundaries,
&gt; &gt; &gt;simply cannot be admitted into the other ontologies without producing
&gt; &gt; &gt;unacceptable confusions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I also agree very strongly with the following:
&gt; &gt; &gt;PH: I think that what seems to me to be overoptimism about the
&gt; &gt; &gt; prospects of the SUO among some folk might arise from their failure
&gt; &gt; &gt; to appreciate that such incompatible conceptualizations can even
&gt; &gt; &gt; exist, let alone all have their uses.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree with Matthew's last sentence, but not the first one:
&gt; &gt; &gt;MW: I have a simple attitude towards incompatible conceptualisations:
&gt;they
&gt; &gt; &gt;mean we do not understand the world around us. The world around us is not
&gt; &gt; &gt;incompatible with itself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There may be very good reasons for using incompatible representations even
&gt; &gt;when a single unified one is understood, as Pat explained with his example
&gt; &gt;of quantum electrodynamics.  I also believe that there are a very large
&gt; &gt;number of other examples that one could use, as I tried to explain in the
&gt; &gt;Knowledge Soup chapter of my KR book.
&gt; &gt;Although I agree with a great deal of what Pat says, I would quibble with
&gt; &gt;the following:
&gt; &gt; &gt;PH: the
&gt; &gt; &gt;world around us IS incompatible with itself, in that we have to use
&gt; &gt; &gt;two incompatible ways of conceptualizing it in order to fully
&gt; &gt; &gt;describe it.  There is no single underlying theory of the world, and
&gt; &gt; &gt;some of the best minds who have thought about the matter during the
&gt; &gt; &gt;last century have concluded that there is no way to produce one.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;On the contrary, quantum electrodynamics is a single coherent
&gt; &gt;conceptualization, and it is possible (at least in principle) to use it to
&gt; &gt;solve problems without breaking it apart in incompatible ways.
&gt; &gt;Unfortunately, for most practical problems, QED is so computationally
&gt; &gt;difficult that different (and incompatible) simplifications are necessary
&gt;to
&gt; &gt;get useful results in an acceptable amount of time.
&gt; &gt;I strongly agree with Pat's point:
&gt; &gt; &gt;PH: I think that you believe that there is a single, universally
&gt; &gt; &gt;acceptable, ontology, and that all others can be mapped into it. I
&gt; &gt; &gt;think this will happen only when science stops.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But I still believe that there is something useful that we can
&gt; &gt;accomplish even before science stops.  My best cut at what
&gt; &gt;that may be is summarized in the Knowledge Soup chapter of
&gt; &gt;my KR book.  Summarizing even more briefly,
&gt; &gt;1.      An open-ended lattice of theories, which could be extended
&gt; &gt;arbitrarily far to accommodate any possible way of conceptualizing the
&gt;world
&gt; &gt;in any finite set of concepts.  A complete lattice would have to be
&gt; &gt;infinite, but any particular version that might be implemented at any one
&gt; &gt;time is finite.  However, there is no restriction on what anyone might add
&gt; &gt;to it, given enough time, effort, and ingenuity.
&gt; &gt;2.      Methods for navigating the lattice to find theories that are
&gt; &gt;approximately true or &quot;good enough&quot; for many problems, and with methods for
&gt; &gt;revising and extending theories to make them better adapted to solving new
&gt; &gt;problems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For more about the lattice of theories, see Section 6 of my paper on
&gt; &gt;processes and causality:
&gt; &gt;<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm</A>
&gt; &gt;&lt;<A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/causal.htm</A>&gt;
&gt; &gt;And by the way, I believe that causality is a very important concept that
&gt;is
&gt; &gt;central to a large number of issues in the SUO.  But that is another topic.
