    This standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable computers to utilize it for
    applications such as data interoperability, information search and retrieval, automated
    inferencing, and natural language processing. An ontology is similar to a dictionary or
    glossary, but with greater detail and structure that enables computers to process its
    content. An ontology consists of a set of concepts, axioms, and relationships that
    describe a domain of interest. An upper ontology is limited to concepts that are meta,
    generic, abstract and philosophical, and therefore are general enough to address (at a
    high level) a broad range of domain areas. Concepts specific to given domains will not be
    included; however, this standard will provide a structure and a set of general concepts
    upon which domain ontologies (e.g. medical, financial, engineering, etc.) could be
    constructed.</p>
    <h4>Purpose of Proposed Project:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A. AUTOMATED REASONING: The standard will be suitable for automated logical inference
        &nbsp;&nbsp; to support knowledge-based reasoning applications. </li>
      <li>B. INTER-OPERABILITY: The standard will provide a basis for achieving Inter-Operability
        among various software and database applications. <ul>
          <li>1) Application developers can define new data elements in terms of a common ontology,
            and thereby gain some degree of interoperability with other conformant systems. </li>
          <li>2) Applications based on domain-specific ontologies that are compliant with this
            standard will be able to interoperate (to some degree) by virtue of the shared common
            terms and definitions. </li>
          <li>3) The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange format whereby owners of existing
            applications will be able to map existing data elements just once to a common ontology.
            This provides a degree of interoperability with other applications whose representations
            conform to SUO. This entails the SUO being able to be mapped to more restricted forms such
            as XML, database schema, or object oriented schema. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>C: APPLICATION AREAS <ul>
          <li>1) E-commerce applications from different domains that need to interoperate at both the
            data and semantic levels. </li>
          <li>2) Educational applications in which students learn concepts and relationships directly
            from, or expressed in terms of, a common ontology. This will also enable a standard record
            of learning to be kept. </li>
          <li>3) Natural language understanding tasks in which a knowledge-based reasoning system uses
            the ontology to disambiguate among likely interpretations of natural language statements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
