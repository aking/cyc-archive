<h1>The FOL Distinction</h1>
The page serves as a temporary stub for the categorical logic extension
to the IFF First Order Logic (meta) Ontology (IFF-FOL). <br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The architecture of First Order
Logic (FOL) involves a fundamental distinction or polarity. I initially
wanted to call this the extrinsic-intrinsic distinction. But the term
extrinsic has the unfortunate connotation of superficial or shallow,
and this is not what the meaning of the FOL distinction. One could also
call this the external-internal distinction, the outer-inner
distinction, the exomorphic-endomorphic distintion, but these
also suffer from the same unfortunate connotation. A much pithier
terminology is the shell-kernel distinction. This also has a bit of the
superficial connotation, but it is a well-known in Computer Science.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The exomorphic
aspect of FOL, which is needed for a <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">principled</span>
formulation of the "lattice of theories" concept, has been handled by
the current version of the IFF Ontology (meta) Ontology (IFF-OO).
Exomorphic refers to the architecture outside the notion of an FOL
language or
lexicon, whereas endomorphic refers to the architecture within an FOL
language. <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align: left;">The shell or exomorphic aspect of FOL,
which is implicit in the
development of
Information Flow (see the book <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/references.html#Mathematical_and_Philosophical">Information
Flow: The Logic of Distributed Systems</a> by Barwise and Seligman and
the paper <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/references.html#The_Information_Flow_Framework">The
Information Flow Foundation for Conceptual Knowledge Organization</a>
by
Kent), aims at the architecture illustrated by the diagrams in Figure 1
consisting of four fundamental and sorted categories of language,
theory, model and logic, and their adjoint connections. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The kernel or endomorphic
aspect of FOL, which is formalized in various treatments of categorical
logic
(see the paper <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/references.html#Mathematical_and_Philosophical">Categorical
Logic</a> by Andy Pitts and the paper <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/references.html#Mathematical_and_Philosophical">Hyperdoctrines,
natural deduction, and the Beck condition</a> by Robert Seely), is
concerned with the
hyperdoctrine approach to FOL; this is a standard stratified indexed
category architecture of FOL based on
substitution
along tuples in the Lawvere construction. </li>
</ul>
<p>Formulation of a
categorical extension for the kernel aspect of the IFF-FOL needs three
additions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The conjunction and disjunction operators should be defined on
constant arity collections of expressions. This needs to use the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">relative power construction</span>
discussed in the core considerations. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Substitution needs a thorough axiomatization. This includes an
extension that obviates clash of variables. We are more than halfway
finished with this formulation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An entailment order needs to be inductively defined in the
expression fibers. This can be expressed in sequent form. Example
axioms are: (1) for any two expression subsets related by the inclusion
    <span style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&#8838;&nbsp;<span
 style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>2</sub>
we have the entailment ^<span style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>2</sub>
&#8804; ^<span style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>1</sub>;
or more generally, (2) the entailment holds ^<span
 style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>2</sub> &#8804; ^<span
 style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>1</sub>, if for
every &#966;<sub>1</sub> in <span style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>1</sub>
there is an &#966;<sub>2</sub> in <span style="font-family: script mt bold;">E</span><sub>2</sub>
such that &#966;<sub>2</sub> &#8804; &#966;<sub>1</sub>; (3) for any two
expressions related by entailemnt &#966;<sub>1</sub> &#8804; &#966;<sub>2</sub>,
their negations are related by reverse entailment &not;&#966;<sub>2</sub> &#8804;
&not;&#966;<sub>1</sub>;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
