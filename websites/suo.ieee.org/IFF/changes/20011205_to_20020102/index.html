<STRONG>WHAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED:</STRONG>
<ul>
<li><i>The IFF Basic KIF Ontology has been slightly modifed.</i>  This is the 
interface ontology for the KIF language containing generic concepts. 
It has only one namespace with recommended prefix 'KIF'. The only changes 
to the IFF Basic Ontology is in Tables 1, 2 and 4 (mainly 2). 
<p>
<li><i>The IFF Core Ontology has been slighlty modified.</i>  The only changes to 
the Core Ontology is the addition of the order namespaces 
('ORD', 'ORD.FTN', 'ORD.ADJ', 'ORD.REL', 'ORD.CLO') and graph
namespaces ('GPH' and 'GPH.MOR'). Of course, these add a lot to the size.
<p>
<li><i>The IFF Classification Ontology has been updated</i> to accord with the 
Basic KIF Ontology. It has also lost its order namespace to the Core Ontology.
<p>
<li><i>The IFF Category Theory Ontology has been updated</i> to accord with the 
Basic KIF Ontology. It has also lost its graph namespaces to the Core Ontology.
