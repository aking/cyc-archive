We received <a href = "http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/comments/comments.html">
<strong>32 messages</strong></a>, with "IFF Comments Requested" in the subject 
line, between October 4, 2001 and October 29, 2001.
<p>

<a href = "http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/comments/notused.html">
11 of the 32 messages were not considered further</a>, since they did not 
appear to directly address specific points in the IFF starter documents.
</li>
<p>
<li>
<a href = "http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/comments/whycat.html">
18 of the 32 messages</a> dealt, at least partly, with the question of "Why Category Theory?"
for the IFF.
<p>
These 18 messages also contain other threads that have yet to be indentified.
We will work to identify these other threads in the coming days.
