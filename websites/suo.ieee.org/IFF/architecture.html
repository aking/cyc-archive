<p class="text">The IFF architecture (Figure 1) is a two dimensional structure consisting of levels (the vertical dimension) and namespaces (the horizontal dimension). Within each level, the terminology is partitioned into namespaces. The number of namespaces and the content may vary over time: new namespaces may be created or old namespaces may be deprecated, and new terminology and axiomatization within any particular namespace may change (new versions). In addition, within each level, various namespaces are collected together into meaningful composites called meta-ontologies. At any particular metalevel, these meta-ontologies cover all the namespaces at that level, but they may overlap. The number of meta-ontologies and the content of any meta-ontology may vary over time: new meta-ontologies may be created or old meta-ontologies may be deprecated, and new namespaces within any particular meta-ontology may change (new versions).</p>

<h3 id="modular-structure">Modular Structure</h3>
<p class="text">The IFF architecture (Figure 1) is a two-dimensional structure with metalevels ranging along the vertical axis and namespaces ranging along the horizontal. It is vertically partitioned into the <span style="font-style: italic;">object level</span> at the bottom, the supra-natural part or <span style="font-style: italic;">metashell</span> at the top, and the vast intermediate <span style="font-style: italic;">natural part</span>. The natural part contains the namespaces located at metalevels 1, 2, 3, &#8230; n, &#8230;; and the metashell contains the namespaces located at metalevels &#8216;<small><span  style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">meta</span></small>&#8217;, &#8216;<small><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">type</span></small>&#8217; and &#8216;<small><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">iff</span></small>&#8217;. The natural part is further divided horizontally into <span style="font-style: italic;">pure</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">applied</span> aspects. The pure aspect itself is divided into <span style="font-style: italic;">core</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">structural</span> components. The IFF <span style="font-style: italic;">core</span> consists of the core component of the natural part plus the metashell. The IFF <span style="font-style: italic;">metastack</span>, which is the kernel of the IFF core, consists of the kernel of the core component plus the kernel of the metashell.</p>

<h3 id="metashell"><a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metashell/metashell.html">Metashell</a></h3>
<p class="text">The supra-natural part or metashell (Figure 2) consists of only three levels. The tiny (only five terms) <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metashell/iff/iff.html"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-IFF</span></a> namespace, which is located on the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">iff</span> level at the very top of the IFF architecture, provides the terminology for the fundamental ideas of abstract set and function. The medium-sized (&sim; 450 terms) <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metashell/type/type.html"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-TYPE</span></a> namespace, which is located on the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">type</span> level just above the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">meta</span> level, provides typing terminology for the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-META</span> namespace. The <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/core-concepts.html">core concepts</a> of basic collections, metastack orders and fundamental relations are introduced on the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">type</span> level. The very large-sized <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-META</span> namespace, which is located on the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">meta</span> level just above the natural part of the IFF, services the natural part consisting of the generic metalevels. The <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-IFF</span> namespace represents a (directed) graph of abstract sets and functions, the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-TYPE</span> namespace represents a finitely-complete category of abstract sets and functions, and the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-META</span> namespace represents a topos of Cantorian featureless abstract sets and functions.</p> 

<h3 id="natural-part"><a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/natural-part/natural-part.html">Natural Part</a></h3>
<p class="text">Along the horizontal dimension, the natural part (Figure 2) is partitioned into pure and applied <span style="font-style: italic;">aspects</span>. The applied aspect contains meta-ontologies, such as the IFF institution theory meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-INS</span>), the IFF first order logic meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-FOL</span>) and the IFF ontology meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-ONT</span>), providing the terminology and axiomatization needed for the logical and semiotic functionality in applications. The pure aspect, which is partitioned into core and structural <span style="font-style: italic;">components</span>, represents a natural <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/topos-structure.html">topos hierarchy</a>. The pure aspect contains meta-ontologies, such as the IFF set theory meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-SET</span>) in the core component and the IFF category theory meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-CAT</span>) in the structure component, axiomatizing the set-theoretic and category-theoretic foundations needed elsewhere in the IFF. The natural part is vertically divided into an infinite number of metalevels 0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;n, with level 0 being the object level and level n being a generic metalevel. In the pure aspect of the natural part of the IFF, the axiomatization for any concept is located in one generic module. Such a module gives the axiomatization at level n (1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&#8734;) for that concept. The <span style="font-style: italic;">core</span> of the IFF consists of the core component of the natural part plus the metashell. The kernel of the IFF core is called the IFF <span style="font-style: italic;">metastack</span>. The connection (<a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/metastack.html">Figure&nbsp;1</a>) between the generic finite level axiomatizations and the metashell axiomatizations relies heavily upon the <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/core-concepts.html#metastack-orders">metastack partial orders</a>.</p>

<h3 id="core">Core</h3>
<p class="text">The IFF core axiomatization contains many terms, partitioned according to whether the term is a <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/core-concepts.html">core concept</a>, a diagram term, a (co)limit term or an exponent term. The IFF core axiomatizates finite limits of specific shapes at the type level and general finite limits at all lower levels. Finite limits are connected with Dedekind&#8217;s abstract definition of finiteness (Lawvere and Rosebrugh, 2003). Following the principle of conceptual warrant, terminology has been placed in the IFF core only when it is needed in the lower or more peripheral namespaces. All metalevel ontologies import and use, either directly or indirectly, the core meta-ontology. This includes the all meta-ontologies in the structural component of the IFF axiomatization. The IFF core axiomatization is in adjunctive form. The generic level of the core plays a central role in the IFF axiomatization &#8212; this is the most referenced namespace in the natural part of the IFF. The kernel and finite limits namespace axiomatizations of the core rely heavily upon the <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/core-concepts.html#metastack-orders">metastack partial orders</a> for the <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/core-concepts.html#basic-collections">basic collections</a>, respectively. The finite colimits namespace is a categorical dual to the finite limits namespace. The axiomatization for exponents and curry begins at the meta level of the metashell. The collection of kernel namespaces in the IFF core, called <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/metastack-structure.html">the IFF metastack</a>, represents a <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/topos-structure.html">chain of toposes</a>, which anchors the entire IFF architecture. The argument for the metastack structure is based upon the <a href="cantor.html">Cantorian expansion</a>. Furthermore, the vertical structuring of the IFF metastack between metalevels n and n+1 (and between metalevel n and the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-META</span> namespace of the IFF metashell) requires axiomatization for the <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/notes/core-concepts.html#metastack-orders">metastack partial orders</a> at metalevel n+2 (and the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-TYPE</span> namespace of the IFF metashell).</p>

<h3 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h3>
<p class="text">The IFF is a descriptive category metatheory. A central design goal of the natural part is to represent the intuitions of the working category theorist, using their illustrations, called commutative diagrams, to represent their ideas. A central design goal of the metashell is to support the terminology in the natural part in conformance with the strong restrictions of the syntactic mechanism incorporated in <a href="grammar.html">the IFF grammar</a>. There is a strong boundary between the object levels of the IFF and the metalevels. The object level represents &#8220;real world&#8221; concepts, whereas the metalevel provides the mechanism to structure these concepts. Although the metalevel contains <a href="#metalanguages">metalanguages</a> describing the object languages at the object level, the distinction between the object and meta levels is not exactly <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/">Tarskian</a>, since the object level in the IFF contains only instance data. Traditional logical structuring of object level data is incorporated in the metalevels of the natural part, mostly at the lowest metalevel 1.

<h3 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h3>
<p class="text">In general, the axiomatization of the IFF uses full first order expression, consisting of set, predicate (unary relation), (unary) function and (binary) relation symbols, with the usual logical connectives and quantifiers. The development of the IFF is governed overall by two design principles: conceptual warrant and categorical design. Both are limitations of the logical expression. <span style="font-style: italic;">Conceptual warrant</span> seeks to limit the content of logical expression, by requiring us to justify any introduction of terminology (and attendent axiomatizations). These should be based upon need at lower metalevels and object level. <span style="font-style: italic;">Categorical design</span> seeks to limit the form of logical expression to atomic expressions: set declarations (declarations that an element is in a set), equations (commutative diagrams, since they use only unary functions) or relational expressions (declarations that a pair is in a relationship).A major goal is to require that the natural part conform to the principle of categorical design. Hence, the natural part should be expressed atomically as set declarations, equations and relational expressions &mdash; but mostly equations. Since functions are unary, these equations correspond to the commutative diagrams of category theory.</p>

<h3 id="transition">Transition</h3>
<p class="text">The colors illustrating the levels in the current architecture (Figures 1 and 2) closely correspond to those describing <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metastack/version20040707.html">the previous architecture</a>; the most important change was expansion of the lower metalevel in the previous architecture into the natural part of the current architecture. In short, the old lower metalevel became the natural part, the old upper metalevel became the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-META</span> namespace, the old top metalevel became the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-TYPE</span> namespace, and the old Ur metalevel became the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-IFF</span> namespace.</p>

<h3>Logical Expression</h3>
<p class="text">An important design constraint of the IFF is that the natural and objective parts are fully conformable to the categorical design principle. This means that all axiomatization in the natural and objective parts are atomic, consisting of either set declarations, equations or relational expressions (relation declarations). Since the equations, which make up the largest part of the axiomatization of the natural and objective parts, consist in the composition of unary functions, they correspond to the commutative diagrams of category theory. In one sense, the atomic axiomatization of the IFF natural part is much closer in spirit to the intuitions of the working category-theorist, than the usual idea that the foundations of category theory has a first order expression. In the IFF, such first order expression only appears in the metashell. In other words, in the IFF traditional logical expression has been relegated to the metashell. The metashell is used by the various meta-ontologies in the pure aspect of the natural part: either the single meta-ontology <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-SET</span> in the core component; or the various meta-ontologies in the structural component, including the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-CAT</span> meta-ontology, the IFF 2-category theory meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-2CAT</span>), and the future IFF double category theory meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-DCAT</span>). The metashell acts as a bootstrapping mechanism from which the natural part can be unfurled: first unfurl the core component; next unfurl the structure component; and last unfurl the applied aspect, including the IFF institution theory meta-ontology (<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">IFF-INS</span>).</p>
