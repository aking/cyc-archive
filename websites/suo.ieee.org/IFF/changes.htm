<H2> Changes to IFF from <a href = "../Kent-IFF.pdf">previous version</a> 
     to current version (October 4, 2001)</H2>
<pre>
<ul>
<li> What was the introduction section in the starter document 
     is now a separate <a href = "Introduction.htm">Introduction</a> file.
<p>
<li> What was the "Large Aspect" in the starter document
     is now _mostly_ in the <a href = "IFF Core (sub)Ontology.pdf">IFF Core (sub)Ontology</a> file.
     The exception is that the "Large Orders" subsection of the starter document
     is now in the <a href = "IFF Classification (sub)Ontology.pdf">IFF Classification (sub)Ontology</a> file.
<p>
<li> What was the Category Theory Ontology section in the starter document
     is now _mostly_ in the <a href = "IFF Category Theory (sub)Ontology.pdf">IFF Category Theory (sub)Ontology</a> file.
     The exceptions are that the the "Namespace of Large Classifications"
     and the "Namespace of Large Concept Lattices" are now in the
     <a href = "IFF Classification (sub)Ontology.pdf">IFF Classification (sub)Ontology</a> file.
<p>
<li> The "Large Aspect" has thus expanded and now includes 
     (1) the IFF Core (sub)Ontology;
     (2) the IFF Category Theory (sub)Ontology; and
     (3) the IFF Classification (sub)Ontology.
<p>
<li> What was the model theory ontology section in the starter document
     is now not covered by an updated document.
     We expect this document to be posted some time in the coming months. 
</ul>
