<h1>The SUO Information Flow Framework (SUO IFF)</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<small><q>Philosophy cannot become scientifically healthy without an
immense technical vocabulary. We can hardly imagine our great-grandsons
turning over the leaves of this dictionary without amusement over the
paucity of words with which their grandsires attempted to handle
metaphysics and logic. Long before that day, it will have become
indispensably requisite, too, that each of these terms should be
confined to a single meaning, which, however broad, must be free from
all vagueness. This will involve a revolution in terminology; for in
its present condition a philosophical thought of any precision can
seldom be expressed without lengthy explanations.</q></small></div>

<h2><a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/version/20021205.htm">Latest
Version of the SUO IFF</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This latest version of the SUO IFF
(Figure 1) was submitted to the SUO
on 5 December 2002. It introduces the <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/ontology/ontology/version20021205.htm">IFF
Ontology meta-Ontology (IFF-ONT)</a> to the SUO IFF lower metalevel.
The
IFF-ONT axiomatizes the object-level by introducing the notions of <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/namespace/theory/version20021205.pdf">theory</a>
and (local) <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/namespace/logic/version20021205.pdf">logic</a>.
Any object-level ontology is abstractly represented by an IFF theory,
and any populated object-level ontology is abstractly represented by an
IFF logic. A theory, which consists of a <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/namespace/type-language/version20021205.pdf">type
language</a> and a set of axioms, exists only at the type pole of the
instance-type polarity, and represents object-level ontologies with a
formal or axiomatic semantics. A logic, which combines a theory with
the notion of a <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/namespace/model/version20021205.pdf">model</a>
that satisfies the theory, represents object-level ontologies with a
combined semantics, having both the axiomatic semantics of the theory
and the interpretative semantics of the model. IFF theories and logics
are the first order renditions of the theories and (local) logics of
Information Flow. In addition to
</p>
<ol>
  <li>introducing the new notions of theories and logics and</li>
  <li>enhancing the previous notions of language and model,</li>
</ol>
the IFF-OO also
<ol start="3">
  <li>presents the <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/metatheory/ontology/version20021205.pdf">metatheory</a>
or category theory, of object-level ontologies, and</li>
  <li>axiomatizes the <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/namespace/type-language/version20021205.pdf">truth</a>
concept <span style="font-style: italic;">lattice of theories</span>
over a type language.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/versions/">All versions of the SUO
IFF</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are currently six versions of the
SUO IFF that were submitted
over the last two years. The 20 July 2001 version, the IFF Foundation
Ontology, introduced the SUO IFF. In the 4 October 2001 version of the
SUO IFF the three upper level meta-ontologies emerged, and in the 5
December 2001 version of the SUO IFF the Top Core meta-Ontology was
axiomatized. The 2 January 2002 version of the SUO IFF offers more
polished versions of these four meta-ontologies. The 15 May 2002
version of the SUO IFF introduced the Model Theory meta-Ontology, the
first of several that reside in the lower metalevel. And finally, the 5
December 2002 version of the SUO IFF offers an abstract representation
for object-level ontologies with the Ontology meta-Ontology.</p>
<h2><a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/version/20010720.pdf">The SUO IFF
Foundation Ontology</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IFF Foundation Ontology, which was
the starter document,
prototype, and first version of the SUO IFF, was submitted on 20 July
2001. Since then many things have happened in the development of the
SUO IFF: three metalevels have emerged; in <a href="foundation.html">the
new IFF
Foundation (meta) Ontology</a> various parts have taken on an identity
of their own (the Top
Core, Upper Core, Upper Relation-Order, Upper Classification and Upper
Category Theory&nbsp;
(meta) Ontologies); and various new meta-ontologies have emerged in the
lower
metalevel.</p>
<h2>Additional Material</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three additional meta-ontologies are
being used in the background.
Because of their current unpolished nature (they are all about 80%
finished), these ontologies have so far not been submitted. They will
eventually reside in the lower metalevel. They are the Lower Core,
Lower Classification and Algebraic Theory meta-Ontologies. The SUO IFF
site map has links to rough cuts of all three meta-ontologies. The core
is the axis for the entire SUO IFF. It cuts across all three
metalevels. Since the central part of the core represents sets and
functions, the core set-theoretically represents the small, the large
and the generic; or categorically represents small notions, large
notions and quasi notions. The Lower Core (Upper Core, Lower
Classification) meta-Ontology restricts, specializes and extends the
Upper Core (Top Core, Upper Classification) meta-Ontology. The
Algebraic Theory meta-Ontology (IFF-AT) represents universal algebra
and equational logic. The IFF-AT axiomatizes the object-level by
introducing the notions of <span style="font-style: italic;">algebraic
theory</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">universal algebra</span>.
An algebraic theory is a special kind of theory consisting only of
equations between pairs of terms. An algebra is a special kind of model
consisting only of domains and operations on those domains. The IFF-AT
represents and generalizes the functorial semantics of F. W. Lawvere.</p>
