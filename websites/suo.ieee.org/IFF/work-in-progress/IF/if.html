<h2>Information Flow</h2>
<p> Barwise and Seligman propose a mathematical model that aims at
establishing the laws that govern the flow of information. It is a
general model that attempts to describe the information flow in any
kind of distributed system, ranging form actual physical systems like a
flashlight connecting a bulb to a switch and a battery, to abstract
systems such as a mathematical proof connecting premises and hypothesis
with inference steps and conclusions.<br>
</p>
<p> It is based on the understanding that information flow results from
regularities in a distributed system, and that it is by virtue of
regularities among the connections that information of some components
of a system carries information of other components. The more
regularities the system has, the more information flows; the more random
the system is constituted the less information will be able to flow
among its components.<br>
</p>
<p> As a notion of a component carrying information about another
component, Barwise and Seligman follow <a
 href="http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/site/157586195X.html">Dretske's
characterisation</a>, in which assertions of the sort </p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
  <p>The rifle shot carried the information that the king was dead to
the whole city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> or </p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
  <p>The greyness of the sky carries the information that a storm is
approaching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> are abstractly characterised as following a common pattern: </p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
  <p> a's being F carries/bears/conveys the information that b is G.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In fact, it is a particular rifle shot that informs us of the king's
death, and hence event <span style="font-style: italic;">token</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">e</span> of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">type</span> 'rifle shot' that will carry
this information. A rifle shot 50 years later will definitely not carry
the information that the present king is dead as will the present rifle
shot not indicate that the king of the neighbouring city is dead. It is
the fact that the event token of the rifle shot is connected
spatio-temporarily with the event of the king's death that we know that
the information flows. Channel theory formalises this crucial aspect of
information flow, namely that it is the tokens and its connections that
carry information, so that information flow involves both types and
tokens.<br>
