<h2>Work in Progress</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p> The work in progress efforts below are strongly connected. They
support the IFF representation of the structural aspect of the SUO.
There is consensus that the SUO should be represented by logic,
specifically by first order logic. The IFF Ontology (meta) Ontology
represents a general form of first order logic, namely a form of
order-sorted first order logic where the sort order has been
generalized
to a sort IF theory and the model-theoretic structures allow the
contextual notion of relational classification. There is also consensus
that the SUO should represent a modular framework for ontologies. The
IFF represents and situates the modular framework of a library of
modules within the homogeneous context of a lattice of theories or the
heterogeneous context of the category of theories. The essence of the
logic that represents the SUO is an abstract logical system; that is,
an
institution. The notion of an institution is equivalent to the notion
of
a truth structure. In addition to ontological systems, institutions
have
been applied to the management of database systems. The IFF develops
the lattice of theories within the general theory of institutions or
truth. The channel theory of Information Flow (IF) reveals how
participating ontologies in a modular framework carry information about
each other.&nbsp; Other topics of interest for work in progress in the
IFF are the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) notion of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">conceptual scaling</span>,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> algebraic semiotic systems</span>, and the
development of a module representing <span style="font-weight: bold;">common
logic</span> (CL). The overall structure of truth and the lattice of
theories can be partitioned into conceptual scales according to topic,
where one topic could be the metadata about the theories in the
lattice.
The IFF takes the high road to implementation. There is work in
progress
on an IFF representation of the Meta Object Facility (MOF) and the
Model
Driven Architecture (MDA) of the Object Management Group (OMG). In the
other direction, there are on-going explorations to demonstrate how the
MOF can be used for a high level specification of the IFF.<br>

<h4><a name="IFF-OO"></a>IFF-OO: The Ontology (meta) Ontology (new
version)<br>
</h4>
<p> Currently, the first revision of the IFF Ontology (meta) Ontology
is
under construction. This is a reasonably major revision. The purpose of
this revision is to formulate the notion of a first order language,
such
that the categories of models and logics are cocomplete. The problem
with the first version is briefly explained here.<br>
</p>
<p>The IFF Ontology (meta) Ontology (IFF-OO) in the lower metalevel
contains axiomatizations for the notions of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">first order language</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">first order model-theoretic structure</span>,<span
 style="font-style: italic;">first order theory</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">first order logic</span>. Obviously, these
notions and the IFF-OO itself are first order representations for the
theory of Information Flow, a theory that is implicit in the book by
Barwise and Seligman and explicit in the paper "The Information Flow
Foundation for Conceptual Knowledge Organization" by Kent (see the <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/references.html">references</a> for
links
to both of these). The goal is to provide a categorical representation
for all four concepts (language, model, theory and logic) that
faithfully represents the fundamentals of these notions, where
appropriate categories are both cocomplete and/or complete, and where
suitable free notions, hence adjunctions, exist. To follow the IFF
approach to semantic integration, we need all of these properties. The
first version of the IFF-OO got the free notions, but did not get all
cocompleteness. In particular, the category Logic of first order logics
and their infomorphisms was not cocomplete, since coproducts could not
be computed. In hindsight, the problem with the first version of the
IFF-OO was a too faithful representation of the sort function (see
Enderton in the <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/references.html">references</a>
or Chris Menzel's <a
 href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/suo/email/msg01792.html">recapitulation</a>,
which in the first version of the IFF-OO is called the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">reference function</span> of a first order
language. We get cocompleteness in the new version of the IFF-OO, and
still retain a sort-like function, by defining a notion of spangraphs
as
a categorical equivalent to hypergraphs. It was a little delicate to
come up with this idea, but once you have the axiomatization down it is
fairly simple.</p>

this document axiomatizes and represents the category Set of sets and

and
colimits, since these are used to represent the limits and colimits in
other categories axiomatized in the IFF lower metalevel.</li>
  <li>The namespace of <a

this document axiomatizes and represents the category Hypergraph of
hypergraphs and hypergraph morphisms.
Although many notions of hypergraph are possible and have been defined
in the literature, this document defines a notion that is most suitable
for the IFF. </li>

this document axiomatizes and represents the category Spangraph of
spangraphs and spangraph morphisms. Spangraphs are equivalent to
hypergraphs, but can be more flexible in modeling relational arity.
Spangraphs nicely model the SCL "role-set syntax", where arguments form
a set of role-value pairs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: '<small><span
 style="font-family: courier new;">(Married (roleset: (wife Jill)
(husband Jack)))</span></small>'<br>
This notion has been advocated in SCL development by Pat Hayes.
Position and argument order are not needed.&nbsp; According to Hayes,
this provides some insurance against communication errors. </li>

<h4><a name="LOG"></a>LOG: Logic</h4>
<p>In this work area, we are interested in axiomatizing the abstract
syntax and model-theoretic semantics of several logical languages:
traditional first order logic (FOL),
simple common logic (SCL), and the
logical language (IFF-KIF) used for the axiomatization of the
various meta-ontologies in the IFF.
</p>
<h5><a name="FOL"></a>FOL: First Order Logic</h5>
<ul>
  <li> <a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/ontology/fol/version20040101.html">The
IFF First Order Logic (meta) Ontology (IFF-FOL)</a>: This project is
our first cut at the IFF axiomatization
of first order logic (FOL). First order logic is simple &#8211; in contrast
to the Simple Common Logic (SCL), traditional FOL does not have
variably
polyadic relations (predicates), quantification over the predicate or
function position,
or sequence variables. In fact, the core difference between the SCL
approach to
the formulation of logic and the IFF approach is concentrated in the
distinction between relations and functions. The central motif and data
structure for the SCL is the relation concept (here we mean the concept
of a multivalent or n-ary relation), whereas the central motif and data
structure
for the IFF is the function concept (and here we mean the concept of a
unary
function, which is a central example of the concept of a morphism from
category
theory). As usually, understood, the multivalent relation is the more
complex
and more expressive of the two, and in spirit the SCL regards a
function as just
a functional relation. However, from the IFF perspective, the function
concept
is simpler than the relation concept, it is more closely related to
programming
languages in general, and it is just as expressive as the relation
concept. In
fact, any typed multivalent relation can be represented by functions in
several
ways: the most obvious representation is as a collection of attribute
functions
from the relation extent to the argument extents; but the IFF actually
uses a
different representation for multivalent relations, as seen in the FOL
language
namespace of the IFF Ontology (meta) Ontology. This design decision, of
whether
to place the relation concept or the function concept at the core, is
of the
highest importance. Many other design decisions fall out from this. </li>

<h5><a name="SCL"></a>SCL: Simple Common Logic</h5>
<ul>
  <li><a
 href="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/metalevel/lower/namespace/scl/version20040505-obj.pdf">The
IFF Namespace of Simple Common Logic (IFF-SCL)</a>. This project is our
first cut at the IFF axiomatization of simple common logic (SCL). SCL
has three advances over traditional first order logic (FOL): variably
polyadic relations
(predicates), quantification over the predicate position, and sequence
variables. The <a
 href="http://www.ontologos.org/SCL%20Abstract%20Syntax.pdf">abstract
syntax</a> of SCL (terms and formulas), consisting of
synthetic/constructor operators, analytic/selector operators and axioms
asserting an invertible relationship between pairings of
synthetic/constructor and analytic/selector operators, is the highest
meta-level needed in order to define the syntax and model theory for
SCL. Abstract syntax is related to the programming style of processing,
with synthetic/constructor operators compatible with declarative
programming style and analytic/selector operators compatible with
imperative programming style. Axiomatization of the SCL in the
terminology of the Information Flow Framework (IFF) has the following
advantages. </li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integration</span>: By being

connections to other modules of the IFF.</li>

representation but also morphic connection.</li>

SCL.</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reuse</span>: We can easily

<h5><a name="IFF-KIF"></a>IFF-KIF: The Shell Metalanguage</h5>
<ul>
  <li><u style="font-weight: bold;">The Syntax and Semantics of
IFF-KIF</u>:
This project is our first cut
at the IFF axiomatization of IFF-KIF. Clearly, this effort has a
certain
reflexive quality to it. The IFF-KIF has a simple lisp-like format,
which additionally uses the two abbreviations of restricted
quantification and definite descriptions. Just like SCL, which has a
similar abstract syntax and semantics, the IFF-KIF has one advance over
FOL it uses quantification over the relation position. However, in
contrast to SCL, the IFF does not use sequence variables, it does not
need (at least so far) variably polyadic relations (predicates), but
instead it only needs binary relations (predicates) in the body of its
expression and unary relations for its restricted quantification.
Furthermore, it regards functions as things that return a value but are
not implicitly functional relations (functions and relations are
disjoint), it needs only 1-place functions, and it regards constants as
individual constants.<br>
