Allan,
   The situations you are discussing are fine, and should not be
prohibited.  People should be free to create derivative works of
standards.  There is no murkiness.  The only issue is conformance, and the
license covers that.  People generally are, and should be, free to create
derivative works and sell them, and there is no reason why the IEEE should
own that derivative work.  Review by a lawyer of the tiny changes we've
made to the license is prudent, but it shouldn't hold up publication of the
current version, or its use and extension.

&gt;Unfortunately I'm not making this a complicated situation.  Legally, it
&gt;already is one.  I am suggesting that a few weeks of time to get maybe
&gt;half a dozen extra lines into the license might save us considerable grief
&gt;
&gt;US copyright law itself was originally written to cover printed books and
&gt;other creations whose revisions and derivative works, if any, tend to be
&gt;few and infrequent.  And these traditional works tend to be created by one
&gt;author, or by a small number of authors in a situation highly controlled
&gt;by a central author, editor, or publisher.  Creation of derivative works
&gt;is also usually highly controlled by a central owner, with specific
&gt;permissions given to specific people.  Although software, data, and
&gt;websites are indeed copyrightable, the exact type of coverage is often
&gt;unclear because the law has not yet been rewritten to clearly deal with
&gt;the more complex issues created by modern technology, rapid small changes,
&gt;and group creation.
&gt;
&gt;Although any problems may eventually be resolved in court, court is not a
&gt;place we want to go. Forestalling that outcome is to everybody's benefit.
&gt;
&gt;First, my observation is that the majority of people lack familiarity with
&gt;even copyright basics. Those in the software business are probably a bit
&gt;more informed but not expert.   Still, they will need the SUMO license to
&gt;inform them of exactly who owns the rights, what permissions they
&gt;themselves have, and what notices they themselves may or may not add to
&gt;the work, even if all this is automatic according to copyright
&gt;law.  Making things crystal clear is less likely to cause accidental
&gt;copyright violations and their resulting problems.
&gt;
&gt;Second, once anyone modifies SUMO they have created a derivative
&gt;work.   According to US law copyright automatically belongs to the person
&gt;(or company) who created the work, at the time it is created.  There is a
&gt;current version of SUMO owned by IEEE.  Anyone who does new work on it
&gt;_automatically owns their part_ of this derivative work (although not the
&gt;original work) _unless there is an explicit copyright transfer to
&gt;IEEE._  Otherwise the ownership of the derivative work would be mixed.
&gt;IEEE would not be legally able to use, or permit others to use, this
&gt;derivative work because they would not own the new parts of it.  And the
&gt;person who created the derivative version might then pass it on to others
&gt;to work on, and the ownership would become even more confused.   Of
&gt;course, anyone who wanted to pass on a derivative version of SUMO would
&gt;want to pass on  the whole thing, regardless of who owned which
&gt;parts.  Furthermore, they might put their own copyright notices on a
&gt;version of SUMO and even register it with the Copyright Office.
&gt;
&gt;If IEEE wants ownership of derivative versions of SUMO as a condition of
&gt;allowing people to use SUMO in the first place, this must be stated in the
&gt;license.  Possibly users must be made to sign (click on) an agreement to
&gt;that effect, or some sort of copyright transfer form.  The exact manner of
&gt;transfer is something a lawyer should be consulted about.  But if there is
&gt;no statement about or transfer of ownership of the derivative SUMOs, there
&gt;would be a murky multiple ownership, the type of thing that would have to
&gt;be settled in court if problems arose.
&gt;
&gt;My company run into this exact problem recently.  It took our lawyer and
&gt;the people who worked on the project many expensive, frustrating hours to
&gt;straighten it all out.
&gt;
&gt;Third, if anyone should wish to sell and profit from their derivative
&gt;version of SUMO--and since it's good technology  someone will--a court
&gt;case would become quite likely.  Didn't Microsoft and Apple sue each other
&gt;over GUI technology both had taken from Xerox PARC work and created their
&gt;own derivative versions?
&gt;
&gt;I don't view consulting a lawyer as a complex or hostile procedure.  It's
&gt;taking a little trouble now to prevent a whole lot of trouble in the future.

&gt;&gt;Allan,
&gt;&gt;   My understanding is that the issues that concern you are covered by
&gt;&gt;copyright law, and need not be reiterated in the document itself.  If
&gt;&gt;someone owns a copyright to a work, I think the law already would cover the
&gt;&gt;restriction on not removing the copyright and claiming the work as one's
&gt;&gt;own.  Let's keep it simple.
