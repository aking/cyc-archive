Matthew,

        Here's the first change to the SUMO page.  Could you upload this
proposed draft of SUMO, change the SUMO page to call it version 1.71 and
link to it.  Thanks.

Jim

Folks,
   Enclosed is the latest SUMO version for your review.  I have another
version in progress which I'll distribute soon.

;; ================================================

;; This is the source file for the SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology), 
;; an ontology that was developed within the SUO Working Group by merging
;; the SUO &quot;candidate content&quot; sources and refining and extending this content on 
;; the basis of various knowledge engineering projects and input from the SUO 
;; Working Group.

;; The SUMO is freely available, subject to the following IEEE license.

;; The SUMO was initially developed at Teknowledge Corp.

;; Version date: July, 2004
;; Version number: 1.71
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; The SUMO incorporates elements of John Sowa's upper ontology (as described at 
;; <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/ontology/toplevel.htm</A> and in Chapter 2 of his 
;; book _Knowledge Representation_, Brooks/Cole, 2000), Russell and Norvig's 
;; ontology, PSL (Process Specification Language), Casati and Varzi's theory of 
;; holes, Allen's temporal axioms, the relatively noncontroversial elements of 
;; Smith's and Guarino's respective mereotopologies, the KIF formalization of the 
;; CPR (Core Plan Representation), the ontologies available on the Ontolingua 
;; server maintained by Stanford University's Knowledge Systems Laboratory, the 
;; ontologies developed by ITBM-CNR, some of the spatial relations from an 
;; unpublished paper by Iris Tommelein and Anil Gupta entitled &quot;Conceptual 
;; Structures for Spatial Reasoning&quot;, and a &quot;Structural Ontology&quot; proposed by 
;; David Whitten and substantially revised and extended by Chris Menzel.
;; Note that some of the subclasses of 'Process' in the SUMO were originally 
;; inspired by some of the verb classes from the second part of Beth Levin's book 
;; &quot;English Verb Classes and Alternations:  A Preliminary Investigation.&quot;

;; The knowledge representation language in which the SUMO is expressed is SUO-KIF, 
;; which stands for &quot;Standard Upper Ontology - Knowledge Interchange Format&quot;.  SUO-KIF 
;; is a simplified form of the popular KIF knowledge representation language.  A 
;; specification of SUO-KIF can be found at:  <A  HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/suo-kif.html">http://suo.ieee.org/suo-kif.html</A>.  It 
;; should be noted that some of the axioms in the SUMO make use of row variables 
;; (indicated with a &quot;@&quot; prefix).  Such variables are not currently part of the SUO-
;; KIF specification, but they simplify matters significantly in some cases.  Details 
;; about row variables can be found in the following paper:  
;; <A  HREF="http://reliant.teknowledge.com/IJCAI01/HayesMenzel-SKIF-IJCAI2001.pdf">http://reliant.teknowledge.com/IJCAI01/HayesMenzel-SKIF-IJCAI2001.pdf</A>.

;; The SUMO is a modular ontology.  That is, the ontology is divided into 
;; self-contained subontologies.  Each subontology is indicated by a section 
;; header, and the dependencies between the subontologies are specified with 
;; statements of the form &quot;;; INCLUDES '&lt;SUBONTOLOGY&gt;'&quot;.  These statements are 
;; found at the beginning of each section.  The dependencies between the 
;; various subontologies can also be graphed as follows:

;; Note that the &quot;+&quot; sign at the end of an arc indicates the direction of 
;; dependency - the node near the sign includes the subontology at the other 
;; end of the arc.  Note too that in some cases the dependency is 
;; bidirectional.  Separating ontologies in cases like these is useful when 
;; their respective topics can be cleanly differentiated.

For example, the &amp;%Meter is a &amp;%UnitOfMeasure for the dimension of length, 
as is the &amp;%Inch.  There is no intrinsic property of a &amp;%UnitOfMeasure that 
makes it primitive or fundamental; rather, a system of units (e.g. 
&amp;%SystemeInternationalUnit) defines a set of orthogonal dimensions and 
assigns units for each.&quot;)
