Jim,
   We incorporated at the beginning of the project the following sources,
which I've annotated with their copyright status.  In general, most were
taken from open academic sources which do not require any release.

The following items were from open academic sources that do not need an
explicit release:

Ontolingua
   Standard-Units ontology
   Agents and Numbers ontologies
   Simple-Time ontology
   Standard Dimensions
   abstract-algebra
   kif-extensions
   kif-relations
   kif-sets
   frame-ontology
   okbc-ontology
   component-assemblies
   product-ontology
   physical-quantities
   scalar-quantities
   unary-scalar-functions

ITBM-CNR
   Natural-Kinds ontology
   Positions ontology
   Quantities
   Actors
   top-level
   social-objects
   topic
   meronymy
   topology
   topo-morphology
   localization
   assessment
   structuring-concepts
   physical-concepts
   Unrestricted-Time
   Representation
   Anatomy
   Biologic-Functions
   Biologic-Substances

- &quot;Quantities and Units of Measure&quot; by Helena Sofia Pinto, published at our
first IJCAI SUO workshop.

- Enterprise Ontology, Mike Gruninger et al.

- unpublished paper on spatial concepts written by Iris Tommelein
and Anil Gupta

- The ontology of normative concepts was derived from Ray Jackendoff's papers.

- Process hierarchy from Beth Levin's work &quot;English Verb Classes and
Alternations.&quot;

- The TOVE enterprise model


Other content:

- Content that we incorporated from Bishop Wilkins' book from the 1600's is
out of copyright and doesn't need a release.

- The core of PSL was a public NIST document and doesn't need a release.

- The bulk of input from Chris Menzel was performed under a small
subcontract that gave full rights to incorporate the work for general
distribution in SUMO.  Other input of his was contributed on the email list
and in private emails.

- Many other people contributed comments on the public email list, which
were incorporated into the document.  These people include Pat Hayes, David
Whitten, Scott Farrar, Jery Hobbs, Pieere Grenon, David Flater, Michal
Sevcenko and Pat Cassidy, among others.  Comments from the SUO list do not
need a release.

- I obtained explicit permission from MIT press to incorporate the axioms
from Casati and Varzi's &quot;Holes and other Superficialities&quot;, as well as
permission from the authors themselves.  Although we didn't need permission
to incorporate portions of the axioms into SUMO, I also wanted to publish
their entire theory verbatim, so I though that needed explicit permission.

- I had rights to incorporate my own Core Plan Representation work into
SUMO, which also was published in academic sources such as AAAI.

- The only question I have at the moment is about a &quot;slot dictionary&quot; from
University of Texas, which I believe is published as open source academic
work, but which I can no longer find on the web.

So, I think we have complete permission from all the SUMO sources.  Note of
course that all of these were incorporated very early in the process of
developing SUMO, and one would be hard pressed to identify the source of
any particular content SUMO from an inspection of the current document.

&gt;SUMO Subgroup,
&gt;
&gt;         One thing the SUMO group we will need to do (regardless of who is
&gt;TE) is obtain a copyright release letter for all documents merged into
&gt;SUMO.   I currently have letters (obtained by Adam Pease several years
&gt;ago) from/for:
&gt;
&gt;         Teknowledge for: &quot;doamin independent ontologies prduced by
&gt;Teknowledge under our Standard Upper Ontology SBIR contract.  This covers
&gt;the current &quot;Merged Ontology&quot; produced by Ian Niles as well as any and
&gt;all future version.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;         James Allen Dept of Computer Science Un of Rocheester for:
&gt;&quot;Toward a General Theory of Action and Time&quot; Artificial Intelligence, 23,
&gt;pp 123-154
&gt;
&gt;         Robert Kent  for: &quot;IFF Foundation Ontology&quot; [Actually, since IFF
&gt;was submitted to IEEE, we don't need this letter.]
&gt;
&gt;         Barry Smith,  Un of Baffalo  for:
&gt;                 &quot;Ontological Tools for Geographic Representation&quot;
&gt;(Roberto Casati, Barry Smith, and Achille C. Varzi), &quot;Fiat Objects&quot;
&gt;(Barry Smith), &quot;Mereotopology: A Theory of Parts and Boundaries&quot; (Barry
&gt;Smith), and &quot;Fiat and Bona Fide Boundaries&quot; (Barry Smith and Achille C.
&gt;Varzi)
&gt;
&gt;         Stuart Russell, Computer Science Div, Un of California, Berkley
&gt;for:  &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;         Peter Norvig for: &quot;Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;         Could someone see if they can find the latest template for a
&gt;copyright release letter.  You could start at <A  HREF="http://standards.ieee.org">http://standards.ieee.org</A>
&gt;
&gt;         As a start, could someone compile a list of other sources we need
&gt;to obtain a letter for, including email or postal address.
