When there is no underlying cause, simple analgesia with a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen might be all that is needed. As
with amenorrhoea, treatment of oligomenorrhoea depends on the underlying
cause and what the woman wants.
In contrast, the tuberculoid form is localised, so its affects are less
widespread across the body.
How is it contracted? If there is an underlying disease causing the
dysmenorrhoea then this should be treated. In the main, it is caused by
three different strains of meningococcal bacteria, known as group A, B
and C. With each menstruation, this tissue outside of the womb responds
to the same hormones that control periods and therefore builds up and
breaks down and bleeds in the same way as the womb lining.
These symptoms are followed by high fever and shaking chills.
Chronic diseases, such as diabetes and alcoholism, also seem to increase
vulnerability to Legionnaires' disease.
political and social upheaval has led to large numbers of people moving
into new areas where disease is spread more easily.
Some patients are given low dose aspirin to help ease the joint and
muscle pains and reduce any inflammation.
The key is to try to prevent patients from becoming dehydrated.
If these do not work, a woman might want to consider surgery to remove
the uterus completely or have the womb lining stripped.
A small number of cases can be caused by fungal infection. It is most
prevalent in poverty-stricken areas of in Asia, Africa and Latin
America.
The treatment depends on the cause. Experts believe the virus is rare
and only found in Africa.
There are three types of the disease.
