<H2>Discussion </H2>
<OL>
<LI><I>Organize KIF into a KIF-Core and a set of modules. </I>
<P>In general, these issues raised a number of different points concerning the 
nature of languages, lexicons (signatures), and theories. 
<P>Adam emphasized the need to distinguish the language of KIF from ontologies 
that can be written in KIF. 
<P>The discussion centered on what it meant for something to be an ``extension'' 
of KIF-Core. Chris Menzel identified two approaches to defining extensions to 
the language: 
<UL>
<LI>KIF-Core contains only one nonlogical symbol (=); all others are introduced 
and axiomatized in extensions; 
<LI>The language of KIF-Core includes all possible relation symbols, but only 
equality is axiomatized in the Core </LI></UL>Pat raised the issue of how to 
extend the language when building ontologies. In particular, what is the syntax 
for declarations for new symbols in the language? 
<P>Chris responded by proposing that we define the notion of the language of a 
"KIF theory", which would include a possibly empty set of predicates (except for 
=), a possibly empty set of function symbols, and a possibly empty set of 
constant symbols. 
<P>The fundamental issue here is: 
<P><I>What is the language of KIF, and how do we ensure extensibility? </I>
<P>Adam saw three aspects to the language: 
<UL>
<LI>BNF grammar 
<LI>axioms for the lexicon i.e. terminals of the grammar 
<LI>ontologies/theories </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<LI><I>Proposed extensions to KIF-Core </I>
<P>Adam expressed concerns that the modular organization of KIF could lead to 
the balkanization of the standard. (Editor's note: This is my wording, but I 
believe that it captures the danger that whenever contentious issues arise, the 
proposed options will be treated as different extensions rather than be resolved 
in a unified manner within the standard.) The following general principle was 
proposed: 
<P>For any extension, we should be able to "back-translate" into the KIF-Core. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Omit variadic relations and functions </I>
<P>The group agreed to adopt this proposal. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Omit sequence quantification </I>
<P>The group agreed to adopt this proposal. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Eliminate the identification of expressions with lists </I>
<P>The group agreed to adopt this proposal. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Allow case-sensitive identifier names </I>
<P>The group agreed to adopt this proposal. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Introduce a sorted language definition </I>
<P>The discussion of this feature revolved around whether it should be included 
in KIF-Core, and also on how sorts should be incorporated into the syntax. One 
proposal was that sorts could be a grammatical extension to KIF-Core; the 
problem is that sorts complicate the grammar. 
<P>Mark Stickel and Pat Hayes both stressed the need of an additional 
specification of the grammar for a sorted language rather than relying on the 
mapping between sorted and nonsorted language. In particular, one can take a 
non-well-formed formula in a sorted language and map it into a well-formed 
formula in a nonsorted language. 
<P>Chris Menzel had earlier proposed an approach to sorted languages based on 
Enderton. However, it was felt that this approach is too simplistic for KIF. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Simplify and reorganize quotation </I>
<P>The group agreed to table this issue for the workshop. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Retain the use of the truth predicate <TT>wtr,</TT> possibly within the 
Metatheory Extension. </I>
<P>Editor's note: I can't remember what we said here ... 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Change the syntax for definitional forms </I>
<P>The group agreed to adopt this proposal, although no new syntactic constructs 
were proposed. Pat stressed the need for some syntactic mechanism for pointing 
out definitions without the logical weight of the definitional forms in the 
current KIF documents. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Introduce lambda expressions </I>
<P>The group agreed to table this issue for the workshop. 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Allow general terms, including variables, to occur in the first position 
of expressions (i.e. relations and functions need not be constant symbols.) </I>
<P>Editor's note: I can't remember what we said here ... 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Introduce expressions (not just KIF expressions, but arbitrary 
expressions) as first-class entities, distinct from lists, and have a reasonably 
powerful syntax-description ability using the language to express BNF directly. 
</I>
<P>The group agreed tht we need the ability to describe languages and their 
syntax. Ontologies can be written using this language extension; the original 
KIF Metatheory would be one such ontology. 
<P>This feature (together with quotation) will be necessary to specify axiom 
schemata 
<P></P>
<LI><I>Integrate a modern class-inheritance mechanism into the syntax. </I>
<P>This issue will be tabled either to a later meeting or the workshop. 
<P></P></LI></OL>
<H2>Action Items </H2>
<OL>
<LI>Chris Menzel will identify options for addressing the issue of "What is a 
language?" 
<LI>Identification of options for sorted languages. (I can't remember who was 
going to do this). </LI></OL>
