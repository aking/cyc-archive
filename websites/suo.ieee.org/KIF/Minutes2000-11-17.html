<H2>Discussion </H2>
<H3>Modular Organization of KIF </H3>The current proposal is that all extensions 
are one of the following: 
<UL>
<LI>new nonlogical lexicon with the same grammar with the same grammar or they 
specify new 
<LI>different grammars. Along these lines, Pat viewed extensions as extending 
the grammatical categories of KIF-Core. For example, with quotation, character 
strings would be a subcategory of some grammatical category in the Core. 
</LI></UL>One question is how new nonlogical symbols are introduced. 
<P>John Sowa proposed there should be a simple, limited core plus metalevel 
operators such as assert and retract. These operators can talk about what goes 
into another KIF module, and say things such as ``we are using theory X and 
theory Y in our ontology.'' 
<P>This idea raised the question of how assert is different from simply writing 
an axiom. 
<P>The discussion centred on the role that the metatheory will play. For John 
and Pat, there is a stronger need to explicitly refer to other ontologies. In 
particular, Pat sees to ways of referring to another ontology: 
<UL>
<LI>use the ontology's vocabulary 
<LI>import the the ontology. In this case, we need to refer to other theories 
explicitly as objects. </LI></UL>
<P>The consensus was that KIF must have a metatheory extension. An action item 
was to elaborate the requirements for such a metatheory. Two were discussed in 
the meeting: 
<OL>
<LI>quotation 
<LI>capability for specifying new grammars </LI></OL>
<H3>Sorted languages and KIF </H3>People in the meeting had the following 
positions: 
<P>Pat: KIF-Core is unsorted. 
<P>John: KIF-Core contains no sorts but has the capability of writing sorts. The 
semantics is unsorted but the grammar allows polymorphism. 
<P>Mark: Need to be aware of grammatical restrictions on sorts, which can impose 
heavy burdens on implementations. 
<P>
<P>The point was raised that there are several different approaches to sorted 
languages. KIF98 allows restricted quantification. Chris Menzel said that this 
is only syntactic sugar; it is not really sorted, since there is no change in 
the semantics. Another approach to sorting is to tie the sorts to variables so 
that predicates are sorted. There was general agreement that we need to go one 
step further and support order sorting together with inheritance. However, there 
was some discussion over exactly what features are included here -- should some 
predicates (e.g. subtype, instance, restriction-to) have special status which 
get handled in special way? One new issue that arose was the treatment of the 
sort predicates in this approach. For the definition of sorts, predicates need 
to be arguments to predicates. Mark Stickel proposed the notion of ``punning'' 
-- a given theory may use the same symbol for a constant, function, and 
predicate. In the Core, there are no semantic constraints among these, but sort 
constraints among these would be introduced in the sorted extension. This is one 
possible way of preserving a first-order semantics for predicates that allow 
predicates as arguments. 
<H3>The ability to describe the syntax of languages within KIF </H3>The basic 
issue here is a specification of the requirements that must be supported by KIF. 
Pat feels that a substantial functionality for KIF-Meta can be handled by 
quotation. John Sowa felt that if we have good operators for KIF(meta), can 
probably do what we need for any other syntax. 
<P>There was a lot of discussion related to the intended application of the 
ability to describe the syntax of languages within KIF. This part of the meeting 
was difficult to summarize, so I am including Mike Uschold's rough notes 
verbatim: 
<P><I>Adam: not want meta-level stuff in KIF core, not sure why. Just want plain 
First-Order Logic, not the extra gunk. Want simple language, with simple 
extensions. No confusion, as there were in early versions of KIF with all the 
ontological stuff there and other facilities too. 
<P>John: wants meta-level assertions, To explicitly say "I am asserting X". 
<P>Editing is a meta-level assertion. Need to be able to say we are using theory 
X and theory Y, this is meta-level. 
<P>CM/PH: not need to explicitly say I am asserting, just hand off the ontology 
and that means these are asserted. 
<P>General agreement to be clear about what is meta-level vs what is object 
level. 
<P>John: First log in: no assertion, but do have metalevel tools, e.g editor 
tool, which does asserting. Need to be able to say want to use this editor or 
that, also translate character string into kif expression, copy this module into 
that module - primitive meta-level operations. 
<P>MU: why need to formalize what editor does? 
<P>JS: META level KIF defines API for kif. 
<P>JS: Ability to HAVE meta-level needs to be in core. But the metalevel stuff 
can be in an extension. 
<P>PH: current KIF-meta stuff may be adequate insome sense, but 
probably/possibly not the best way to do it. 
<P>TODO: make a list of the kinds of meta-level operations that we want. (JS?) * 
translate 
<P>* assert/retract
<P>* rename
<P>* procedural attachments...
<P>* <FOR inter-operability for things stating>
<P>- here is stuff in XML, want to say XML tags have formal definition.
<P>JS nearly comes for free, with quasi-quote 
<P>CW: this may best be thought of as 'Ontology Management Software'. 
<P>Punch line: General agreement about need for meta-stuff, substantially in an 
extension. Not total agreement on how central the meta stuff is? 
<P>JS: Python has XML parser defined in Python, but terribly inefficient. It 
serves role of saying what actually happens, but need to go to, say C 
implementation to actually do the work. 
<P>PH: but, is this visible to the logic? 
<P>Much of this is orthogonal to the logic, so let's move on! </I>
<P>
<H3>Standardization Issues </H3>Michael G. restated the proposal that SUO-KIF be 
the baseline, with the remaining features of KIF98 being extensions. The 
discussion centred on the degree of coupling between the Core and extensions. 
Mike Uschold and Adam raised the point that anytime you have options to use some 
modules and not other ones, inter-operability suffers to the extent that people 
use different sets of modules. 
<P>
<H3>Action Items </H3>Chris Menzel will elaborate the implications of the 
different proposals for sorted languages. 
<P>John Sowa will write a specific proposal for metalevel operators. </P>
