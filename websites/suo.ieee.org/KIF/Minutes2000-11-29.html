<H2>Discussion </H2>The following notes reflect the outcomes of the discussions 
during the meeting, in roughly chronological order: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>SUO-KIF Document </B>
<P>It was agreed that the SUO-KIF document will be used as the baseline, so that 
KIF-Core contains at least all of the features specified in the SUO-KIF 
document. 
<P>The following were some problems that were identified with SUO-KIF: 
<UL>
<LI>There is no need for an inequality relation 
<LI>Fix the grammar for <TT>&lt;=&gt;</TT> 
<LI>Why should we allow functions with no arguments? Should this be <TT>term+ 
</TT>? 
<LI>The notion of <TT>bottom </TT>will be eliminated. One of the original 
motivations for bottom was to handle partial functions. In KIF-Core, functions 
will be total, but we will simply not care about the values that they take for 
unrestricted arguments. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<LI><B>Namespaces </B>
<P>The group discussed the need for a syntactic mechanism for referring to 
namespaces, although there was concern that this could get bogged down in 
ontology management issues. 
<P><I>Consensus: </I>There will be no commitment to namespaces, but that we will 
extend the BNF so that <TT>wordchar </TT>explicitly contains special alpha 
characters that can be used to identify namespaces. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Nonmonotonic Reasoning </B>
<P>Mike Genesereth raised earlier concerns regarding the introduction of 
features related to nonmonotonic reasoning, which was included in the KIF 3.0 
document, but removed from subsequent drafts. 
<P>One proposal was to identify operators (such as <TT>unprovable, bagofall 
</TT>) that people could use to specify nonmonotonic features. We would also 
provide syntax to allow people to incorporate new operators; however, within the 
standard, operators would be uninterpreted constructs. 
<P><I>Consensus: </I>The group did not arrive at any consensus on this issue, 
although if they are included, they will belong to a new extension. 
<P><I>Action Item: </I>Mike Genesereth will flesh out the requirements for 
nonmonotonic operators. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Sorted KIF </B>
<P>The introduction of a sorted extension to KIF is motivated by the following 
concerns: 
<UL>
<LI>By enforcing sorts at a syntactic level, we avoid unintentional errors in 
axiom writing by ensuring that arguments have the right types; 
<LI>efficiency; 
<LI>economy of expression; 
<LI>interface to object-oriented world; 
<LI>semantics. </LI></UL>
<P>The group agreed that KIF-Core should be unsorted. 
<P>After a great deal of discussion, there was still disagreement about the 
introduction of a Sorted KIF extension. The objections were primarily concerned 
with the danger of the balkanization of the standard, particularly when merging 
two ontologies in which one ontology uses only the unsorted Core while the other 
uses the Sorted extension. Another objection was that the declaration of sort 
information belongs more properly to an ontology rather than the language of 
KIF. 
<P>There was discussion concerning the declaration of sorts. Declaring sorts 
before using them could result in undesired behaviors. The sort hierarchy has to 
be set a priori, but you will get errors that you do not want, if the sort 
hierarchy is not set up correctly. E.g. variable ?x is a human, could be 
rejected by a parser if not yet delclared to be a subsort of animal. The problem 
is that in an open world, people will often be adding sorts and changing the 
hierarchy. 
<P>Among those who are proposing a Sorted KIF extension, there was agreement on 
the required features. Given the restricted quantifiers from the KIF-Core BNF, 
there is no change to the BNF of the Sorted KIF extension. However, the syntax 
for specifying sort information (i.e. sort signature) must be added. This would 
include new operators <TT>defsort</TT>, <TT>topsort </TT>, and <TT>subsort,</TT> 
as well as boolean operators on sorts (union, intersection, complement). 
<P>There was some disagreement about including the restricted quantification in 
KIF-Core. However, it was argued that restricted quantification provides a 
convenient syntax for users, as well as providing a hook to make it easy to link 
with the Sorted extension. 
<P><I>Action Items: </I>
<P>Pat Hayes will sketch out the syntax for sort declarations (as top-level 
forms that are not embedded in formulae). This will include a treatment of the 
interaction between sorting and having variables in the predicate position. 
<P>There is also a need to write a few notes on the semantics for the new 
grammatical constructs in the proposed Sorted KIF extension. 
<P><I>Undecided Issues? </I>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Should signature be given in a single place, or can it be distributed? 
<LI>If we say S1 and S2 disjoint, is the statement (and (S1 ?x) (S2 ?x)) 
interpreted as false, or is it syntactically invalid? 
<LI>Do we want predicates for every sort? 
<LI>Are the sort names genuine names? Should the same name be used for the sort 
and ^ the predicate? </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<LI><B>Variadic Relations and Sequence Variables </B>
<P>Although these had earlier been eliminated in the first teleconference, Mike 
Genesereth urged that they be reintroduced as part of KIF-Core (as they are in 
the dpANS document). Although variadic relations can be included without 
sequence variables, Mike argued that they sequence variables provide a simple 
way of dealing with n-ary arguments and lists. 
<P>The following objections were raised against the introduction of sequence 
variables: 
<UL>
<LI>complication of the language; 
<LI>questions about the semantics of sequence variables, particularly if 
sequences are not elements of the domain; 
<LI>awkwardness -- there cannot be quantified sequence variables, and the @l 
variable is forced to be in the last position. </LI></UL>
<P><I>Consensus: </I>The use of variadic relations was not contentious, but no 
consensus was reached on the introduction of sequence variables (although there 
was relatively strong support for their inclusion). 
<P><I>Action Item: </I>Mike Genesereth will write a clear exposition of the 
semantics of sequence variables <TT>@l </TT>. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Quantification over Relations </B>
<P>An example of this is <PRE>(&lt;=&gt;	(symmetric ?R)
	(&lt;=&gt;	(?R ?x ?y)
		(?R ?y ?x)))
</PRE>
<P>It was agreed that this can be handled by saying that we are quantifying only 
over all relations in the domain of discourse. 
<P>An unresolved issue is the interaction between this feature and sorted 
languages. 
<P><I>Action Item: </I>Chris Menzel will fully specify the semantics of this 
quantification. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>MetaKIF </B>
<P>The introduction of the MetaKIF is motivated by the following concerns: 
<UL>
<LI>mechanism for extending KIF in the future; 
<LI>describing the syntax and semantics of KIF and other languages; 
<LI>defining inference procedures; 
<LI>implicitly referring to theories and their sentences; 
<LI>writing axiom schemata. </LI></UL>
<P>The main discussion revolved around proposals for <TT>quote </TT>and the 
model theory of MetaKIF. The original treatment of <TT>quote</TT> from KIF 3.0 
and the dpANS document (which we shall refer to in these notes as structured 
quote), was based on the use of lists and the restriction to finite lists in 
particular. 
<P>There were three proposals for handling <TT>quote</TT>: 
<OL>
<LI>Character string quote (see Chris Menzel's document) 
<LI>Structured quote and string quote (see Mike Genesereth and dpANS) 
<LI>Implicit quoting (i.e. no <TT>quote</TT> construct) </LI></OL>
<P>Mike Genesereth described two motivations for his structured quote approach. 
KIF originally had an abstract syntax (graphs), which was linearized into 
strings; using Menzel's character string quote would be a bias towards a 
particular linearization. In addition, structured quote assists in the 
implementation of reflection principles. 
<P><I>Action Items: </I>
<P>Mike Genesereth will tidy up his proposal for quote and bring it line with 
its stated semantics. Chris Menzel will also flesh out the model theory of his 
approach. We will then evaluate these two proposals on the basis of their model 
theories. Also, Mike Genesereth will provide examples illustrating why implicit 
quoting is insufficient. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Truth Predicates </B>
<P>The proposal here was to adopt <TT>wtr</TT> within the MetaKIF extension. 
<P><I>Consensus: </I>We will leave this issue open for now, altough some truth 
predicate is required, particularly to write axiom schemata. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Relationship to XML </B>
<P>There were no technical issues here. The group agreed to incorporate a DTD 
for the KIF BNF as an annex to the standards document. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Definition Constructs </B>
<P>The original complexity around these constructs arose from the distinctions 
between conservative and partial definitions in the KIF 3.0 document, which are 
not present in the dpANS document. 
<P>The proposal was to introduce a single <TT>def </TT>construct in the MetaKIF 
extension. We still need a BNF for this construct. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>New Operators </B>
<P>John Sowa had earlier proposed the addition of an assert operator. The group 
felt that the functionality of such an operator could be captured by 
<TT>wtr</TT>. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Punning </B>
<P>This discussion is motivated by the question of whether or not the following 
expression should be syntactically legal: <PRE>(P (P P) P)
</PRE>so that the same string is referring to a predicate, function, and 
constant. 
<P>The proposal was that there be no punning allowed. To prevent this, functions 
and predicates must be disjoint in the BNF. We will create non-terminals called 
<TT>pred</TT> and <TT>func</TT>, with the same definition as definition for 
<TT>word</TT>. We will state that no pred shall have same characters as a word, 
and no func shall have same characters as a word. One drawback is that it does 
not allow a complete BNF. </P></LI></OL>
