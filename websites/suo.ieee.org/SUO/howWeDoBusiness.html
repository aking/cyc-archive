    <H2>Authority</H2>

    <P>The SUO WG operates under the <A HREF="http://standards.ieee.org/">IEEE
    Standards Association</A> (IEEE SA) and is sponsored by the <A
    HREF="http://www.computer.org/">IEEE Computer Society Standards
    Activities Board</A>.</P>

    <P>The authorisation for this project comes from the <A HREF="documents/PAR.pdf">Project
    Authorisation Request</A> (PAR), which was approved on 2000-12-07.</P>

    <H2>Procedures</H2>

    <P>We operate under the Procedures of the IEEE SA can be found
    <A HREF="http://standards.ieee.org/resources/index.html#guides">here</A>.
    Of particular relevance are the <A HREF="http://standards.ieee.org/guides/companion/index.html">IEEE
    Standards Companion</A>, and the <A HREF="http://standards.ieee.org/guides/style/2000Style.pdf">IEEE
    Standards Style Manual</A>.</P>

    <P>Formal business of the SUO WG is conducted under Robert's
    Rules of Order (RRO). An IEEE presentation of RRO can be found
    <A HREF="http://standards.ieee.org/faqs/roberts.ppt">here</A>.
    A public domain version or RRO can be found <A HREF="http://www.rulesonline.com/">here</A>.</P>

    <P>One deviation from the normal use of RRO is in the counting
    of votes. IEEE has announced the following new rule for counting
    email ballots:</P>

    <P>YES &gt; 0.5*VOTING MEMBERS</P>

    <P>This means that abstaining, acknowledging (but not voting),
    and not<BR>
    responding are all effectively &quot;NO&quot; votes.</P>

    <P>In practice this makes being a responsible voting member more
    onerous<BR>
    than in the past, when if you were not interested, or not bothered
    about<BR>
    a particular vote, you could acknowledge but not vote, and you
    would not<BR>
    be counted in the ballot.</P>

    <P>If you have consistently not voted in ballots we suggest either:</P>

    <P>1. (Preferably) you take a more active interest in the work
    of the Group<BR>
    and vote (YES or NO) in ballots.</P>

    <P>2. You consider removing yourself from the voting membership
    (which in no<BR>
    other way limits your participation in the Group). You may regain
    voting<BR>
    rights at any time by making a request to the Chair.</P>

    <P>In addition:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>When a change is made in the way we do business (e.g. policy
      on adding or removing voting members) then a two thirds majority
      is required.
      <LI>When the Draft Standard is voted on under the IEEE SA a majority
      of 75% is required.
    </UL>

    <H2>Voting Membership</H2>

    <P>A list of SUO voting members is at <A HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/SUO/documents/voting-members.txt">http://suo.ieee.org/SUO/documents/voting-members.txt</A>.</P>

    <P>Voting membership can be attained by completing an application
    form (see below), participating in the work of this group, and
    waiting for 6-months (from date of application). Participation
    might be in the form of subscribing to the standard-upper-ontology
    email discussion list (see <A HREF="howToParticipate.html">How
    to Participate</A>) (Caution, this list can see some 100+ messages
    per week), or by periodically (every month or two) providing
    comments on documents in development.</P>

    <P><B>Application form: </B>Download the form as an MS Exel Spreadsheet
    <A HREF="documents/SUO-Participants-Jan2001.xls">here</A>, (this
    is NOT an online form), save to your disk, fill in the 13 fields,
    and email to Jim.S3@juno.com. If you are unable to download or
    open this Excel spreadsheet, send an email to the same address
    with the following information: First Name, Middle Initial, Last
    Name, Company, Add1, Add2, City, State, Zip, Country, Phone,
    FAX, Email, IEEE Member #(not required).</P>

    <P>SUO WG voting members who do not acknowledge or cast a vote
    in 2 successive ballots shall be removed from the list of voting
    members. They will be informed of this action, provided they
    can be reached. Such individuals may immediately regain voting
    rights by making a request of the Chair.</P>

    <P>Note: &quot;... do not acknowledge or cast a vote...&quot;
    means those that do neither, rather than meaning than just not
    casting a vote can lead to removal from the voting list.</TD>
