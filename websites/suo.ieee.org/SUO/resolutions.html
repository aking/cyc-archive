        <P>Should the IEEE P1600.1 Standard Upper Ontology Working Group
        (SUO) commence work on a project to develop a standard for ontology
        specification and registration, according to the following guidelines:</P>

        <OL>
          <LI>The standard shall be based on the contributions of three
          SUO candidate projects: <A HREF="http://suo.ieee.org/IFF/">IFF</A>,
          <A HREF="documents/opencyc-ontology.zip">OpenCyc</A>, and SUMO.
          <LI>The standard shall specify an ontology registry, such as
          the metadata registries specified by ISO/IEC IS 11179-3, but
          with extensions that are required to define ontologies and to
          relate them to one another.
          <LI>The ontology registry shall be organized as a collection
          of modules, related in a generalization/specialization hierarchy.
          <LI>Each module shall consist of a theory together with documentation
          and other metadata. The theory shall consist of axioms and definitions
          stated in a logic-based language, such as those in the Common
          Logic (CL) framework.
          <LI>The standard shall include the specification of a methodology
          for testing the theory part of any module for consistency, relating
          theories to one another in the generalization/specialization
          hierarchy, and combining two or more theories to derive a new
          theory that is larger and more specialized than the theories
          from which it was derived.

        in the programme, developing and reviewing the programme deliverables.</P>

        <H3>Objective</H3>

        <P>To develop a 4 dimensional ontology and include it as a component
        within the Information Flow Framework.</P>

        <H3>Work Programme</H3>

        <OL>
          <LI>Develop an ontology based on the 4-dimensional paradigm.
          Initial material to act as a start point is contained in ISO/FDIS
          15926-2. <A HREF="http://www.tc184-sc4.org/wg3ndocs/wg3n1328/lifecycle_integration_schema.html">http://www.tc184-sc4.org/wg3ndocs/wg3n1328/lifecycle_integration_schema.html</A>
          The approach will be to develop the ontology as reusable components,
          where appropriate.
          <LI>Make the 4-Dimensional Ontology available as components within
          the Information Flow Framework and develop mappings to other
          ontologies within the framework.
