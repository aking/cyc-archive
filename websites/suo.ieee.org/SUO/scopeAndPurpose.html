    <H4>Scope of Proposed Project:</H4>

    <P>(The <I>Scope</I> describes what is being done, including
    the technical boundaries of the project.)</P>

    <P><BR>
    This standard will specify an upper ontology that will enable
    computers to utilize it for applications such as data interoperability,
    information search and retrieval, automated inferencing, and
    natural language processing. An ontology is similar to a dictionary
    or glossary, but with greater detail and structure that enables
    computers to process its content. An ontology consists of a set
    of concepts, axioms, and relationships that describe a domain
    of interest. An upper ontology is limited to concepts that are
    meta, generic, abstract and philosophical, and therefore are
    general enough to address (at a high level) a broad range of
    domain areas. Concepts specific to given domains will not be
    included; however, this standard will provide a structure and
    a set of general concepts upon which domain ontologies (e.g.
    medical, financial, engineering, etc.) could be constructed.</P>

    <H4>Purpose of Proposed Project:</H4>

    <UL>
      <LI>A. AUTOMATED REASONING: The standard will be suitable for
      automated logical inference &nbsp;&nbsp; to support knowledge-based
      reasoning applications.
      <LI>B. INTER-OPERABILITY: The standard will provide a basis for
      achieving Inter-Operability among various software and database
      applications.
      <UL>
        <LI>1) Application developers can define new data elements in
        terms of a common ontology, and thereby gain some degree of interoperability
        with other conformant systems.
        <LI>2) Applications based on domain-specific ontologies that
        are compliant with this standard will be able to interoperate
        (to some degree) by virtue of the shared common terms and definitions.
        <LI>3) The SUO will play the role of a neutral interchange format
        whereby owners of existing applications will be able to map existing
        data elements just once to a common ontology. This provides a
        degree of interoperability with other applications whose representations
        conform to SUO. This entails the SUO being able to be mapped
        to more restricted forms such as XML, database schema, or object
        oriented schema.
      </UL>
      <LI>C: APPLICATION AREAS
      <UL>
        <LI>1) E-commerce applications from different domains that need
        to interoperate at both the data and semantic levels.
        <LI>2) Educational applications in which students learn concepts
        and relationships directly from, or expressed in terms of, a
        common ontology. This will also enable a standard record of learning
        to be kept.
        <LI>3) Natural language understanding tasks in which a knowledge-based
        reasoning system uses the ontology to disambiguate among likely
        interpretations of natural language statements.
