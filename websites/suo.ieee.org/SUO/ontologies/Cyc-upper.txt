This allows rules without exceptions to never have to incur the
overhead of default reasoning.

Exceptions to rules are written like so:

  (Except-When R(x1,...,xn) Rule001)

and get canonicalized into rules concluding abnormal like so:

  R(x1,...,xn) => (Abnormal(x1,....,xn) Rule001)

Since a different 'abnormality' predicte is needed for every default
rule in the system, we instead handle this uniqueness requirement by
having a single Abnormal predicate which takes the rule in question
as an argument.

Also, the variables over which abnormality is computed is given as a
single list.  This allows Abnormal to be binary rather than
arbitrary arity. "))

notice that one can talk about the Birth-Date of a person quite safely, but whenever one makes a statement about the AGE of a person that statement will only be true `for a while' -- i.e., in some temporal context.  Therefore it would be a mistake to simply assert to Cyc that (Age Lenat (Years-Duration 45)), because that would be true in some contexts and false in others.  So what one does is to assert an expression of the form  (Holds-In ?X (Age ?Y ?Z)) to indicate that during time interval ?X, the thing ?Y has age ?Z.  For example, (Holds-In (Quarter-Fn 2 (Year-Fn 1996)) (Age Lenat (Years-Duration 45)), which means that Doug is a 45-year-old during the entire second quarter of 1996.  It is seldom correct to use Age outside of some temporal qualification."))

Most animals are considered agents, in most contexts; so are most organizations.   Most plants are not agents, in most contexts.  Inanimate devices are sometimes considered agents, in certain contexts.  This is one of those concepts which is important yet very hard to define precisely.  Here is some elaboration, to help convey the intended meaning of the basic criterion for agenthood:  It must seem that a kind of decision-making is going on, even if it's down at the `mindless' level of the reflex reaction of a spider leg to heat, or the reflex reaction of a Human Resources Department rejecting an applicant with no formal degree.  It generally `sounds right' or `feels  natural' to assign causality to agents, rather than some larger or smaller entity.  E.g., it is more natural to say `Fred wrote an essay' than to say `Fred's left hand wrote an essay' or, at the other extreme, to say `The Solar System wrote an essay'.  Similarly, we might very well talk about `Microsoft' buying IBM, but it would be unnatural and even incorrect to talk about a much larger entity (`corporate America') or smaller entity (`the Microsoft lawyers') as the performer of that buying action."))
