<font color="#458B74" size="+2"><b>knowledge-enhanced searching of captioned information</b></font>
<br><br>

Big organizations frequently possess large libraries of "opaque" information sources; that is, 
data which do not lend themselves to traditional text-based searching methods.  A news agency 
may possess a library of thousands of news photos; a movie studio thousands of film clips; a 
software help desk thousands of text articles too unwieldy to index directly.  When such 
libraries must be searched, a common solution is to attach to each item a short text caption 
describing its contents.  Thus a news photo of a soldier holding a gun to a woman's head might 
be captioned "a soldier holding a gun to a woman's head", plus a few tags for time and place, 
and then could be retrieved by querying for "soldier" or "gun".<p>

This solution, while certainly adequate, is far from ideal.  It would be nice if the photo could
 also be retrieved by queries for "someone in danger", or "a frightened person", or "a man 
threatening a woman".  Such an achievement, however, lies far beyond the abilities of even the
 most sophisticated of traditional text-searching tools, all of which are fundamentally based 
on simple string matching and synonyms.  Most search tools lack the ability to handle 
natural-language queries, and even those that do have some NL capability lack the background 
of commonsense knowledge required to make a connection between having a gun to one's head and 
feeling frightened.<p>

Cyc is not crippled by such a liability.  Cyc knows that guns shoot bullets and are designed to
 kill people; that having a gun to one's head therefore threatens one's life; that those whose 
lives are threatened feel fear; and that the vast majority of soldiers are men.  Cyc can 
therefore conclude that the image in question is, in all likelihood, a good match for each of 
the queries above.<p>

A major focus of the Cyc team's efforts in 1994 was the creation of an image-retrieval 
application for a major corporate partner which possessed a library of hundreds of thousands 
of captioned images, but no fully satisfactory way to search them.  Building on the Cyc 
inference engine and Cyc's <a href="cycrandd/nlu">NL</a> capabilities, we developed a system along 
the lines described above.<p>

First, the content of each image in the library is described to Cyc by converting the english 
captions to <a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/howdoescycreason#cycl">CycL</a> and adding the resulting formulas to the 
<a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/whatsincyc">knowledge base</a>.  Cyc's NL tools permit the english-to-CycL 
translation to be mostly automatic; human intervention is required only in unusual cases.<p>

Once the target images have been described to Cyc, the system is ready to accept queries, which
 can be issued in plain english.  Cyc begins by converting the english queries to 
<a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/howdoescycreason#cycl">CycL</a>, again using Cyc's NL tools.  For example, the english 
query "a frightened person" might be parsed as:<p>

<p>
(#$and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(#$isa ?x #$Person)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(#$feelsEmotion ?x #$Fear #$High))<p>

After asking the user to confirm its parse (or, occasionally, to choose one of two or more 
equally valid parses), Cyc begins to backchain from the query expression, using the image 
descriptions and other knowledge in the <a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/whatsincyc">KB</a>.  When it is able to 
unify all the free variables with the elements of a picture (in our example, <tt>?x</tt> would 
unify with the woman in the picture), Cyc knows it has found a match.<p>

Cycorp has generalized this approach to image retrieval to extend it to other 
opaque-information-source retrieval applications.  For example, document retrieval from 
large libraries of text documents described by short abstracts (analogous to image captions), 
is a task nearly identical in structure to that of retrieving captioned images.  In fact, 
any database of captions, summaries, or abstracts could be handled similarly, whether the 
corresponding library contained images, sounds, video, text, or anything else.
<p>

<font color="#458B74" size="+2"><b><a name="www"></a>www information retrieval</b></font><br><br>

The explosion of the World Wide Web during the last two years has created a tremendous 
opportunity.  The WWW is home to a vast quantity of information, much of which could, in 
principle, be used to make Cyc more intelligent, while shortcutting the laborious process 
of manual knowledge entry.<p>

This could happen in one of two ways: either online information could be extracted, converted 
to <a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/howdoescycreason#cycl">CycL</a>, and incorporated directly into the 
<a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/whatsincyc">knowledge base</a>, or Cyc could be taught to treat external 
information sources as extensions of the KB, without directly incorporating their contents.<p>

Cycorp explored the first approach during 1996.  Currently Cyc is
nearing the critical mass required for the reading and assimilation of
online texts (new stories, encyclopedia articles, etc.) In this scenario, 
Cyc's <a href="cycrandd/nlu">natural language</a> tools are used to process online texts, 
converting them to <a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/howdoescycreason#cycl">CycL</a> for inclusion in the 
<a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/whatsincyc">knowledge base</a>.<p>

Cycorp is also pursuing the second approach.  In this scenario, we write gateways which 
disguise WWW information sources as Cyc agents (with a very limited domain of expertise), 
available to operate in a <a href="cycrandd/distributedai">distributed Cyc architecture</a>.  There is a large 
and ever-growing number of information sources on the WWW which might fill this role.  All, 
however, share the following characteristics:<p>

<ol>
<li>They embody a large corpus of knowledge,
<li>they can respond to HTTP queries for specific knowledge, and
<li>they present their knowledge in an HTML format which, while generally not as regularly 
structured as a database, is sufficiently structured that it can be parsed by a relatively 
simple algorithm.
</ol>

An example is the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="x">Internet Movie Database</a>, a truly 
stupendous compendium of movie knowledge.  A quick browse of the IMD demonstrates that it 
embodies virtually everything there is to know about movies; that it can respond to queries 
for particular actors, movies, etc.; and that it displays the results in a format, which, 
while it varies somewhat from one actor, movie, etc. to another, depending on what information 
is available, is nevertheless fairly regular.<p>

We can effectively annex the contents of the IMD to the Cyc <a href="technology/whatiscyc_dir/whatsincyc">KB</a> 
by creating a gateway which, on the one hand, interacts with Cyc agents exactly as a Cyc agent 
operating in a <a href="cycrandd/distributedai">distributed Cyc architecture</a> would, and, on the other hand, 
simulates the interaction of a WWW browser with the IMD HTTP server.<p>

This gateway is advertised to Cyc as an expert in the movie domain, so that whenever Cyc 
receives a query in that domain, it turns to the gateway for assistance.  For example, let's 
say a user asks Cyc, "What movies did Ronald Reagan act in?".  This might be represented in 
CycL as:<p>

<p>
(#$actedInMovie #$RonaldReagan ?x)
<p>

Cyc hands this CycL query to the gateway, which understands enough about movie-related CycL 
vocabulary to translate this query into an HTTP request to the IMD server for a 
<a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/person-exact?+Reagan,%20Ronald" target="x">page on Ronald Reagan</a>.  
When the IMD server returns the page, the gateway parses the HTML, extracts a list of the 
movies in which Reagan appeared, converts the result to CycL, and then constructs a suitable 
reply to the Cyc agent making the request.  (For reasons not worth explaining, the reply 
contains more than just the answer.)<p>

To the user interacting with Cyc, this transaction is entirely transparent.  It appears to 
the user as if Cyc now knows everything there is to know about movies, and yet the KB still 
fits on the hard disk!<p>

Enhancing Cyc's cinematic erudition may be a fairly frivolous application of the techniques 
described above, but the WWW contains plenty of large sources of semi-structured information 
on weightier topics (stock quotes, company profiles, WWW indexes, resumes, the CIA World 
Factbook, etc.).  The ability to effectively incorporate vast portions of the WWW into a 
"virtual" knowledge base is a compelling possibility.  Not only would it greatly expand the 
effective scope of Cyc's knowledge, but it would do so at little cost to the Cyc development 
team.<p>
