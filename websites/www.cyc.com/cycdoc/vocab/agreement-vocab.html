        <blockquote> A specialization of <a
            href="./info-vocab.html#PropositionalInformationThing">#$PropositionalInformationThing</a>
            and #$Artifact-Intangible. Each instance of this collection
            involves two or more parties who agree that certain
            propositions (which correspond to a small <a
            href="./context-vocab.html#Microtheory">#$Microtheory</a> --
            see the shared note #$AgreementNote) should be true. Making
            the propositions true may require some action or commitment
            of resources on the part of one or more of the <a
            href="./agreement-vocab.html#agreeingAgents">#$agreeingAgents.</a>
            Thus, instances of <a
            href="./agreement-vocab.html#Agreement">#$Agreement</a> will
            usually involve some instances of <a
            href="./context-vocab.html#Obligation">#$Obligation.</a>
            Instances of <a
            href="./agreement-vocab.html#Agreement">#$Agreement</a> and
                <a
            href="./context-vocab.html#Obligation">#$Obligation</a>
            differ, however, in that an #$obligatedAgent is responsible
            for the truth of all of the propositions over which the
            obligation holds. In an <a
            href="./agreement-vocab.html#Agreement">#$Agreement</a> some
            agents may not be so responsible. For example, in a loan
            agreement, the borrower agrees to give the lender back the
            money, but the borrower is the only #$obligatedAgent for the
            repayment. Note that #$obligatedAgents need not be among the
                <a
            href="./agreement-vocab.html#agreeingAgents">#$agreeingAgents</a>
            in the agreement that involves or generates the obligation.
            Moreover, <a
            href="./agreement-vocab.html#agreeingAgents">#$agreeingAgents</a>
            aren't always #$obligatedAgents; e.g., Wanda and Paul may
            agree that Paul alone is obligated to do some task. Notable
            specializations of <a
            href="./agreement-vocab.html#Agreement">#$Agreement</a>
