        <h3>The OpenCyc KB Review Process</h3>
        <br />
The OpenCyc Knowledge Base will undergo significant change as it moves toward a version 1.0 release. 
Among the most important changes will be a review and cleanup of the comments and assertions that are 
present in the beta version.
<ul>
<li>Each constant will be reviewed to ensure that its existence in the ontology is justified.</li>
<li>Each constant will be reviewed to indicate that it is properly positioned in the ontology.</li>
<li>Each constant will be reviewed to ensure that it is definitionally complete. For a constant to be considered 
definitionally complete, the KB must contain GAFs using every #$OpenCycDefinitionalPredicate that makes sense for a given constant (e.g. certain GAFs only make sense for #$Predicates, etc.).</li>
<li>Each <a href="http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/ref/glossary.html#GAF">ground 
atomic formula</a> (GAF) will be reviewed to be sure that it is <a href="http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/ref/glossary.html#well-formed">well-formed</a> and accurate.</li>
</ul>
<p />
<h3>Review Status Indicators</h3>

<b>On Vocabulary Pages</b><p>
<ul>
<li>**COMMENT NOT REVIEWED** indicates that the comment for this constant has not yet been reviewed for 
any or all of: correctness, completeness and readability.</li>
<li>**GAFs NOT REVIEWED** indicates that the constant may not be definitionally complete (as described 
above) and that the GAFs on this constant may not be accurate or well-formed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>In the KB Browser</b><p>
Look at the #$isa assertions in the #$BaseKB of the Term Content Pane.
<ul>
<li>Constants that are instances of #$PublicConstant or #$ProposedPublicConstant have not been reviewed at all.</li>
<li>Constants that are instances of #$PublicConstant-CommentOK or #$ProposedPublicConstant-CommentOK 
have had their comments fully reviewed.</li>
<li>Constants that are instances of #$PublicConstant-DefinitionalGAFsOK or 
#$ProposedPublicConstant-DefinitionalGAFsOK have had their GAFs fully reviewed for well-formedness and 
completeness.</li>
</ul>
