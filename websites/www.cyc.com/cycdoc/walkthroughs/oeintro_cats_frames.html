    <h3>
Introduction
</h3>
    <p>
In this tutorial you will witness the creation of two new constants, and the making of some simple assertions on those constants.</p>
    <p>
Suppose that you have just acquired two kittens (who shall be referred to as "Billy" and "Peter") and they are so enchanting that you feel they should be represented in your version of the OpenCyc KB. Here is how one ontologist would go about such a process, described in first-person terms. I encourage you to follow me as I walk you through the steps I would take, using your browser. Ontological engineering - like any other engineering - is an intensely practical (albeit virtual), task which can really only be learned by doing it.</p>
    <p>
The process I will go through can be broken down into four main steps. Ok, let's begin. 
</p>
    <a NAME='step1'></a>
    <h3>Step One: Find Relevant, Already-existing Constants
</h3>
    <p>
First of all, I will try and find relevant, already-existing constants - constants that I will be able to use to make the assertions about Billy and Peter that I want to make. Of course I could create every constant I wish to use to talk about Billy and Peter, but why reinvent the ontological wheel? (Beware: this task is often harder than it looks...many a cyclist has torn out hair having just worked hard to create a new constant which they perceived as filling a hole in the ontology (say..."<nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
moneyAmountOfCoin</font></tt>
      </nobr>"), only to find an equivalent lurking in the KB under a name they did not expect (say..."<nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
tenderValue</font></tt>
      </nobr>")). </p>
    <p>
First and most obviously, I guess I will want to say that Billy and Peter are kittens. That is probably the most salient piece of information I have about them. Is there a Cyc term that means "kitten"? </p>
    <p>

      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
Unfortunately this turns up nothing. There is no constant called <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Kitten</font></tt>
      </nobr> in the OpenCyc KB.</p>
    <p>
      <a HREF="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/walkthroughs/whyhash_dollar.html','','height=250,width=385, scrollbars=yes'))"><img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/questionmark.gif' width='22' alt='Click here for further explanation of why you just did the above.'></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <a HREF="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/walkthroughs/whyhash_dollar.html','','height=250,width=385, scrollbars=yes'))">What does the '#$' in front of "#$Kitten" mean?</a>
    </p>
    <p>
Maybe, instead of saying that Billy and Peter are kittens, I can say that they are juvenile cats. So now let's try "cat".</p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Enter the word "cat" in the text field next to the "Complete" button in the top frame and click on the "Show" button.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
No luck there, either....In cases such as this, my next step will be to try something more general. Hmmmm....how about "pet"? </p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Enter the word "pet" in the text field next to the "Complete" button in the top frame and click on the "Show" button.</font>
    </p>
    <p>Cyc presents a choice of two constants:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
DomesticPet
NonPersonAnimal</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
How does Cyc produce these two constants from a string ("pet") which is different than both of them? The answer lies with Cyc's 'natural language support'. For example, the KB contains the following two "assertions" (or facts) related to #$DomesticPet:
</p>
    <pre>
Mt : GeneralEnglishMt
  (denotation Pet-TheWord SimpleNoun 0 DomesticPet)
  M(multiWordString ("domestic") Pet-TheWord SimpleNoun DomesticPet)</pre>

<p>
The first assertion above relates the word "pet" to the Cyc constant "#$DomesticPet". The second on relates the phrase "domestic pet" to the same Cyc constant.</p>

    <p>
      <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr> is a more specific constant than <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$NonPersonAnimal</font></tt>
      </nobr>, since <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr> is a specialization of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$DomesticatedAnimal</font></tt>
      </nobr>, which is a specialization of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$TameAnimal</font></tt>
      </nobr>, which is a specialization of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$NonPersonAnimal</font></tt>
      </nobr>. </p>
    <table border='0' width='70%' cellpadding='2' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td align='center'>
          <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/collections_hierarchy.gif'></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <font size='-1'>
            <p>Note: More specific collections 'inherit' the information that exists on
the collections they are specializations of, and have further information
as well. This hierarchy is ordered using the predicate #$genls.</p>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr> is therefore better for me to use to describe Billy and Peter. The reason for this may be summarized in the  '<a NAME='maximeo'>Maxim of Efficient Ontologizing</a>': 
</p>
    <p>
      <table border='6' cellpadding='6' align='center'>
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor='#3399FF'>
            <font color='white' size='+1'>The Maxim Of Efficient Ontologizing: Be as specific as possible without being false.</font>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
I should say that, strictly speaking, this maxim applies to the writing
of individual <em><b>assertions</b></em> (which state facts) and not to the writing of
<em><b>rules</b></em> (which allow Cyc to deduce things from the facts it knows). When
it comes to rules, the more general you can be (without being false) the
better! But this is an introductory tutorial and we will therefore be
confining ourselves to individual assertions.</p>
    <p>
      <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr> is a collection, so to use this constant to make assertions about Billy and Peter I am going to have to assert that they are both members of this collection. </p>
    <p>
What are some other things I am likely to want to say about Billy and Peter? Well, another interesting fact about them is that they are brothers. Does this mean that, as was the case with <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr>, they should be asserted to be a member of a collection called, say, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Brother</font></tt>
      </nobr>? (There is actually a problem with this. Can you see what it is?)

  <a HREF="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/walkthroughs/brother.html','','height=250,width=385, scrollbars=yes'))">What's wrong with making a collection called #$Brother?</a>
    </p>
    <p>
Billy and Peter are not just brothers per se, they are brothers <em><b>of each other</b></em>. Such relationships between two or more things are handled in Cyc using predicates rather than collections. </p>

    </p>
    <p>
No there is not. </p>
    <p>
Again, I realize that I better back up and try something more general. What is a more general version of the concept of brotherhood? Billy and Peter are...related to one another, i.e. they are relatives. Let's try "relatives".... </p>

Yes, there is a <nobr>

#$relatives</font></tt>
      </nobr>! However, don't forget the <a HREF='#maximeo'>Maxim of Efficient Ontologizing</a>. Perhaps there is something a bit more specific, if not as specific as "brothers" would be, that we can use. </p>

Aha! <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$siblings</font></tt>
      </nobr> is more specific than <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$relatives</font></tt>
      </nobr>, and it is also true of Billy and Peter. So we can use that. </p>
    <p>
What else do I want to say about Billy and Peter? They like each other a lot (though they also roll around on the floor a lot biting each other...). So the next thing to do (which should not by now be too surprising) is to type in "likes", to see if there is some term (probably a predicate) I can use to say that Billy and Peter like each other.</p>

    <p>
You should see Cyc produce a constant with the somewhat bizarre name of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likes-Generic</font></tt>
      </nobr>. Some background information is in order here: making a name of the form "[X]-generic" is something of a Cyc convention which means that the constant in question tops a hierarchy of terms regarding [X], which have been defined more specifically. </p>
    <p>
      <table border='6' cellpadding='6' align='center'>
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor='#3399FF'>
            <font color='white' size='+1'>A constant with a name of the form "[X]-generic" tops a hierarchy of
more specifically defined terms regarding [X].
</font>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
In our case, obviously, [X] will be something to do with 'liking'). Such a term is often an 'umbrella term', designed to gather together more specific terms, rather than having actual assertions made on it. Let's therefore look for something more specific. With <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likes-Generic</font></tt>
      </nobr> up, let's see how its comment echoes my remark above:</p>
    <p>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(likes-Generic SUBJ OBJ) means that SUBJ likes OBJ. This
         is a very general liking relation which is most useful for
         organising liking relations and for use during inference; for
         representation purposes, use a spec-Pred.</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
So let's find the appropriate 'spec-Pred' (this is Cyc-talk for 'more specialized predicate') for <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likes-Generic</font></tt>
      </nobr>. </p>

        </tr>
      </table>

    <p>
Here we could just do what we did for <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$relatives</font></tt>
      </nobr>, which was to look at the left-hand frame, under Arg2, and click on "genlPreds". </p>

comment : "(likesObject AGT OBJ) means that when the sentient agent
AGT is interacting in some way with OBJ, that agent feels some measure
of Enjoyment --- that is, (feelsEmotion AGT Enjoyment). The kinds of
interactions that produce Enjoyment depend largely on what kind of thing
OBJ is. Thus, `Joe likes the Mona Lisa' implies that Joe feels Enjoyment
when viewing the Mona Lisa. But `Joe likes pizza' implies that Joe feels
Enjoyment when eating that kind of food. There are some specialized
predicates of likesObject that give more information about the kind of
interaction between AGT and OBJ that results in Enjoyment; see, e.g.,
#$likesSensorially and #$likesAsFriend." </pre></tt>

I'm not sure that I want to assert <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likesObject</font></tt>
      </nobr> of Billy and Peter. Billy doesn't quite like Peter in the way that Joe likes pizza (Billy's frequent biting of Peter notwithstanding). Hmmmm.....And what are these <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likesSensorially</font></tt>
      </nobr> and <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>

      </nobr> that appear in the comment? Why did they not appear when I clicked on "genlPreds"? (Can you figure it out?) </p>
    <p>
In fact the answers are different for the two different predicates. The answer for <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likesSensorially</font></tt>
      </nobr> is that it is a Cyc constant that was not made public - it thus does not exist in the OpenCyc KB. (You can tell this because it is printed in black, not clickable blue).</p>
    <p>
      <table border='6' cellpadding='6' align='center'>

    <p>
The answer for <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likesAsFriend</font></tt>
      </nobr> is a little more complicated. Merely clicking on the "genlPreds" under "Arg2" produces all assertions directly made of the form <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
(genlPreds ?X likes-Generic)</font></tt>
      </nobr>, but a list of all such ?X is <em><b>not</b></em> a list of all the spec-Preds of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likes-Generic</font></tt>
      </nobr>. This is because <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$genlPreds</font></tt>
      </nobr> is a transitive predicate (i.e. if X is a spec of Y and Y is a spec of Z then X is a spec of Z). So there can be many more specs of a given constant than there are 'direct specs' (specs linked to that constant by specific assertions). </p>
    <p>

comment : "(likesAsFriend AGT1 AGT2) means that AGT1 enjoys

<p>
This sounds more like Billy and Peter to me, if "interacting socially" is not just restricted to human society and also covers such activities as eating together and rolling around on the floor chewing one another's ears. This does seem plausible to me. To be sure, let's check what are called the 'argument-constraints' on <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likesAsFriend</font></tt>
      </nobr>. If this predicate is intended only to apply to human beings, then next to the <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$arg1Isa</font></tt>
      </nobr> and <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$arg2Isa</font></tt>
      </nobr> predicates in the main frame for <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likesAsFriend</font></tt>
      </nobr> (assuming it has been well-ontologized) <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Person</font></tt>
      </nobr> should appear. Let's check that...
</p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Look immediately above the comment I just quoted and find arg1Isa and arg2Isa.</font><font size='-1'>

      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
In fact <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Person</font></tt>
      </nobr> does not appear there, only <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$PerceptualAgent</font></tt>
      </nobr>. Will Billy and Peter meet this criterion? Yes they will, once they have been asserted to be members of the collection <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr>, as <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
(#$genls #$DomesticPet #$PerceptualAgent)</font></tt>
      </nobr> is true. (Can you verify this? Hint: you can do this using the green plus <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-green.gif'> you just learned about). So I <em><b>will</b></em> use <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$likesAsFriend</font></tt>
      </nobr>.
</p>
    <p>
Lastly, how about saying how old Billy and Peter are? They are currently 11 weeks old. Let's type in "age".</p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Enter the word "age" in the text field  next to the "Complete" button in the top frame and click on the "Show" button.
</font>
    </p>
    <p>
There is an <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$age</font></tt>
      </nobr>! It too turns out to be a predicate. Here are some of its defining assertions:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
Mt : BaseKB
arg1Isa : SomethingExisting 
arg2Isa : Time-Quantity 
arg1Format : SetTheFormat 
arg2Format : IntervalEntry</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
What does this mean? It means that the predicate <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$age</font></tt>
      </nobr> takes two arguments and the first argument (the thing which has the age) must be an instance of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$SomethingExisting</font></tt>
      </nobr>, and the second argument (the age of the thing) must be an instance of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Time-Quantity</font></tt>
      </nobr>. Are Billy and Peter instances of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$SomethingExisting</font></tt>
      </nobr>? Yes they are. (You might like to verify this - again, using the green plus <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-green.gif'>.) </p>
    <p>
The "formats" of the two arguments are a somewhat more technical affair.
The <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$arg1Format</font></tt>
      </nobr> assertion basically means that different things may occupy
the <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>arg1</font></tt>
      </nobr> position for any given <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>arg2</font></tt>
      </nobr> (Thus, not just one but an arbitrary
number of creatures may be, say, 10 years old at any given time). The
<nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$arg2Format</font></tt>
      </nobr> assertion means that the age given may be a single, discrete
value, or it may be a range (say, between 3 and 4 years). See the comment
on <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$IntervalEntry</font></tt>
      </nobr> for more details on this.

What exactly is a <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Time-Quantity</font></tt>

(#$isa "11weeks" #$Time-Quantity)</font></tt>
      </nobr>. Hmmmm.... What I do find out, however (with the help of some considerable experience with such matters :-)) is that instances of <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Time-Quantity</font></tt>
      </nobr> are the results of a set of <em><b>functions</b></em> (functions which are gathered together in a collection called <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>
#$UnitOfTime</font></tt>
      </nobr>). We have so far encountered collections, individual instances of collections, predicates and microtheories. A function is yet another Cyc animal (a "new beast for our zoo [of logical forms]", as Bertrand Russell once put it).</p><p>

          Time-Quantity of being exactly NUM weeks in duration, and an

The first thing to do is to choose a name for the new constant. "Billy" seems a logical choice. Of course if there were other Billys, Bills, etc. already in the KB, it might be wise to differentiate this constant a little further via its name. When this is desired, a Cyc convention is to append "-The[something]" at the end of a constant name (e.g. <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>Othello-TheGame</font></tt>
      </nobr>, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>Othello-TheMovie</font></tt>
      </nobr>). So I could do "Billy-TheKitten". </p>

Note: At this point in the walk through, you have a choice to make. You can go through the quicker version that avoids (for now) some of the details about working with microtheories; or you can click <a HREF='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/walkthroughs/oeintro_cats_frames_long.html#step3long'>here</a> to use the more detailed version, where you will do some looking for the right microtheories to assert in and ask from. To use the shorter version of the walk through, just keep reading. The long version is 30-60 minutes longer than the short version.</p>
    <p>
In order to prepare for adding assertions to the KB, we're going to set up one new microtheory into which we will put all of our assertions about Billy and Peter. The microtheory will need to "see" all microtheories that contain assertions relevant to knowledge about Billy and Peter.</p>
    <p>
In Step One, we identified the following constants that we'll use to make assertions about Billy and Peter: <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr>, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$siblings</font></tt>
      </nobr>, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$likesAsFriend</font></tt>
      </nobr>, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$age</font></tt>
      </nobr>, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$WeeksDuration</font></tt>
      </nobr>. To use these constants in our new microtheory, we'll need <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$genlMt</font></tt>
      </nobr> links from our new microtheory to microtheories containing "definitional assertions" about these constants.</p>
    <p>
      <a HREF="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/walkthroughs/definitionala.html ','','height=250,width=385, scrollbars=yes'))"><img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/questionmark.gif' width='22' alt='Click here for further explanation of why you just did the above.'></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p>
Now, let's quickly tell Cyc about our new microtheory, which we'll call "Cats-PracticeMt". First, go to the proper tool screen.</p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Click on the Tools link in the top frame. <font size='-1'>
  &nbsp; <nobr>[ <a HREF='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/map_Tools.gif' TARGET='map_window'>Show me</a> ]</nobr>
        </font> This will bring up the Tools page. Click on the "Compose" link in the column on the left. <font size='-1'>
  &nbsp; <nobr>[ <a HREF='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/map_Compose.gif' TARGET='map_window'>Show me</a> ]</nobr>
        </font> This will bring up the Compose KE Text Expressions page. <font size='-1'>

        </font>
      </font>
    </p>
    <p>
This is where you can enter many assertions at one time in a kind of short-hand called KE Text format. Instead of typing in the assertions about our new microtheory by hand, you can copy and paste the assertions.</p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Copy  all of the text from the shaded area below and paste it into the large text box on the Compose page. Make sure the box is checked next to "Remove non-printing characters in strings". Click the [Eval] button.</font><font size='-1'>

    </p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>

assertions and ask questions about a few domestic cats.".
</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
The new page that comes up should contain the following sentence:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>

</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
So now we're ready to add these assertions to the Agenda (which means that they'll be added to the KB).</p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Click the link that says, "Add Forms to Agenda".</font>
    </p>
    <p>
You should see a new page that says:
</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
KE-Text: Forms Added to Agenda</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>These steps should have successfully created our new microtheory and connected it to other useful microtheories. There is one more thing we can do to streamline our work with microtheories. Let's make our new microtheory appear as the default choice when making assertions.</p>
    <p>
      <img border='0' src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif' width='30' alt='Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc.'> &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <font color='#660033'>Click on the Tools link once again in the top frame. This will bring up the Tools page. Click on the "Options" link in the right column.

  &nbsp; <nobr>[ <a HREF='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/map_DefaultMt.gif' TARGET='map_window'>Show me</a> ]</nobr>
        </font> Click the [Change Options] button at the top or bottom of the screen.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
The page that comes up after you click on the [Change Options] button should say "KB Browser Options have been modified". Now, whenever you use the Assert tool, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$Cats-PracticeMt</font></tt>
      </nobr> will be the default microtheory.</p>
    <p>
Let's start making some assertions about Billy and Peter. We'll start by saying that Billy is a domestic pet.</p>
    <p>

This should bring up the assertion-making tool. The "Assert" tool is used to make one assertion at a time. It is not the only way in which assertions can be entered in the KB, but it is the easiest and most straightforward. </p>

#$age</font></tt>
      </nobr> (which is defined as having two arguments and two arguments only). Such an entity, composed of a function and one or more arguments, is known in Cyc-talk as a NAT, which stands for "Non-Atomic Term". </p>

    <p>Now that you are familiar with one method of dealing with microtheories, you can either move on to Step Four to test what you've entered, or, if you would like a more detailed explanation of how to use microtheories and where to place assertions in the microtheory hierarchy, then read the considerably <a HREF='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/walkthroughs/oeintro_cats_frames_long.html#step3long'>longer version of this walkthrough</a>.</p>

Step Three summary - we have now made a number of interesting assertions on our new constants <nobr>
          <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Billy</font></tt>
        </nobr> and <nobr>
          <tt><font size='+1'>
#$Peter</font></tt>
        </nobr>. Maybe you can think of a few more....(For instance, they are both males, surprise surprise!) We also made a new microtheory, #$Cats-PracticeMt, that can "see" all necessary microtheories and will be used to hold all of the knowledge that we assert about Billy and Peter.</p></em>
    <a NAME='step4'></a>
    <h3>
Step Four: Testing in your own Microtheory</h3>
    <b><p>In the previous two steps, we created some constants (including a new microtheory called #$Cats-PracticeMt) and we made some new assertions. In Step 4, we'll be testing Cyc to make sure that the implications of those new assertions are there.

    <p>In fact the Cyc inference engine never returns false - only true or not proven. Cyc knows a great deal but has sufficient humility not to assume that
its failure to prove an assertion P is a sound basis for concluding that P
is false. However, let's try asking <nobr>

<p>
This provides a summary of the inferencing which the :ISA inference module
went through in this case. Can you see what went on? Basically, it
followed the genls hierarchy from the collection <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$DomesticPet</font></tt>
      </nobr> (which
Billy belongs to) up to the collection <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$NonPersonAnimal</font></tt>
      </nobr>. It then found
an assertion that the collections <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$Person</font></tt>
      </nobr> and <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$NonPersonAnimal</font></tt>
      </nobr> are
'disjoint' - i.e. they have no instances in common (which makes sense,
given their names). The module then concluded that since Billy is a
member of the collection <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$NonPersonAnimal</font></tt>
      </nobr>, he cannot be a member of the
collection <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$Person</font></tt>
      </nobr>.
</p>
    <p>
Note that it is <em><b>not</b></em> the case that every query which returns "Not Proven"
can be made to return "True" when negated. Consider, for example, <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>(isa
Billy Dog)</font></tt>
      </nobr>. Try asking this both with and without a (not ...) surrounding it.

    <p>
It turns out that Cyc cannot prove that Billy is or is not a dog. Cyc does
not know enough about Billy to decide either way. Of course if Cyc knew
that Billy were a cat then perhaps Cyc could decide this question. Remember
that we did not manage to assert that Billy and Peter were cats because
there was no <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$Cat</font></tt>
      </nobr> constant. And of course, the relevant inference
would only go through if such a constant were intelligently ontologized.
</p>
    <p>
If you would like to, go ahead and create a constant <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$Cat</font></tt>
      </nobr> (a
collection, of course), assert that Billy and Peter are instances of it,
make whatever assertions on it you think are required to capture the
meaning of 'cat' and, in particular, make whatever <nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$disjointWith</font></tt>
      </nobr>
assertions are required for Cyc to be able to prove that Billy is not a
dog. (Make sure you test with an actual 'Ask' to verify!)
</p>
    <p>
Now, if you are up to a challenge, see if you can make whatever
<nobr>
        <tt><font size='+1'>#$disjointWith</font></tt>
      </nobr> assertions are required for Cyc not to conclude <em><b>any
analogous wrong thing</b></em> about Billy....:-)</p>

What else should we expect Cyc to be able to infer about Billy and Peter? </p><p>
Here are some suggestions for further Asks:
</p><blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
Is Billy light enough to be carried around? (Can be proven True, under
the right circumstances)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
Have Billy and Peter ever met or come into physical contact? (Can be
proven True, though this one is harder than the last! Hint: the relevant
predicate may take some digging up.)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote><p>
I encourage you to try doing some other asks, then making some other assertions, then doing still further asks....You are now on your way to becoming a Cyc-savvy ontological engineer. Have fun!!</p><p>Now that you hav completed the shorter versions of steps three and four, if you would like a more detailed explanation of how to use microtheories and where to place assertions in the microtheory hierarchy, then read the considerably <a HREF='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/walkthroughs/oeintro_cats_frames_long.html#step3long'>longer version of this walkthrough</a>.</p><em><p>
