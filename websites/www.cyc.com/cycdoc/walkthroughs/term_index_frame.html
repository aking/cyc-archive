<p><b>How do I use the Term Index Frame?</b></p>

<p>The Term Index Frame (the left-hand frame when viewing a constant in the KB Browser) contains a list of operations that can be performed on the displayed constant, as well as an index of assertion types involving the constant.</p>

<p>Clicking on an index category in the Term Index will cause the corresponding set of assertions involving the displayed constant to be displayed in the right-hand frame. For example, clicking on "genls" under the "Arg 1" heading will display all of the supersets of the constant. Clicking on the red diamond  next to a category will bring up the Hierarchy Browser display for the constant using the category as the indexing predicate. Clicking on one of the plus "+" icons will compute all possible assertions (local plus deduced) in that category using the Literal Query tool.</p>

<p>When looking at a predicate, like #$relatives, clicking on "genlPreds" under the "Arg 2" heading will show assertions that start with #$genlPreds and that have #$relatives in the Arg 2 position -- in other words, assertions of the form</p>

<tt>
<pre>
(genlPreds ?PRED relatives)
</pre>
</tt>

<p>These will be more specific predicates than #$relatives (e.g., #$cousins).
