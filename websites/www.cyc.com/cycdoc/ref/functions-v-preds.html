This document should provide insight into the discussion of when to use functions and when to use predicates.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Given a real-world relationship between N items that is functional in
at least one of those items, should one create a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Predicate>#$Predicate</a> or a
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Function-Denotational>#$Function-Denotational</a> to represent that relationship?  If the
relationship is not at all functional, of course a Predicate must be
used.  But if at least one of the "arguments" is functional, the
relationship could be represented with either a function or a
predicate.  For example, one could represent the "successor"
relationship with either a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#BinaryPredicate>#$BinaryPredicate</a>,
<pre>
  (#$successor 1 2)
</pre>
or with a #$UnaryFunction, 
<pre>
  (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#SuccessorFn>#$SuccessorFn</a> 1) which returns 2.  
</pre>
Which is better? 

<ol>
<li>There can be multiple, independent reasons to choose one or the
other.  This means that sometimes, the best thing is to have BOTH a
predicate and the corresponding function.

Aside: 
In the case where we do have equivalent functions and predicates, it
will be appropriate to write an axiom such as this in some appropriate mt: 
<p>
<pre>
  (#$implies (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a> ?X (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> ?C)
        (#$government ?C ?X))
</pre>
<p>
<li>If you want to be able to add new terms to your language on the
fly, during inference, you must have the function version (else use a
SkolemFunction).  For example, we know that practically every country
has a government.  If all we had was #$government, we could use the
expression
<pre>
  (#$government ?C ?G) 
</pre>
to bind ?G to the government of ?C, but we would only find bindings in
cases where someone had bothered to introduce, by hand, a term
corresponding to the government of ?C.
<p>
Named functions are more desirable than Skolem functions, partly due to
clarity.
<p>
<li>If you want to be able to associate a piece of code to compute the
functional "argument", you should represent the relationship with an
EvaluatableFunction.  What if we represented "plus" with a predicate? 
<pre>
   (#$plus 2 2 ?X)
</pre>
It is possible to make a predicate an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#EvaluatableRelationship>#$EvaluatableRelationship</a>, but the current system only supports an
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#evaluationDefn>#$evaluationDefn</a> which expects all arguments to be fully-bound.  So if
"plus" were an evaluatable predicate, we could answer the question
<pre>
   (#$plus 2 2 4) 
</pre>
<p>
as True, but we couldn't use the defn to find bindings for
?X as in the expression further above.
<p>
<li>In cases where you want to frequently assign a value to the
functional "argument", a predicate is most useful.  For example, the
"height" relationship is functional -- for every PartiallyTangible,
there is some Distance that is the height of the object.  We could use
a function --
<pre>
   (#$HeightFn #$Karen) 
</pre>
-- to generate that Distance. However, this would only be useful in
certain cases.  If we want to declare that Karen has a particular
height, this is best accomplished with a Predicate:
<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#heightOfObject>#$heightOfObject</a> #$Karen (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/quantity-vocab.html#Foot-UnitOfMeasure>#$Foot-UnitOfMeasure</a> 5.3)), 
</pre>
<p>
<li>In cases where you want to compare or constrain the value of a
functional arguement, a function version is useful:
<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/quantity-vocab.html#greaterThan>#$greaterThan</a> (#$HeightFn #$Karen) (#$HeightFn #$Muffet))
</pre>
<li>There are several reasoning modules with special support that can
be applied to Predicates: <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlPreds>#$genlPreds</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlInverse>#$genlInverse</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#negationPreds>#$negationPreds</a>,
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#negationInverse>#$negationInverse</a>, etc.  In order to use these, you have to have a
predicate.
<p>
<li>If the relationship is functional in more than one argument, you
can get by with a single Predicate but would require more than one
Function.  For example, "atomic number" is a one-to-one relationship.
We can have a single predicate
<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/chemistry-vocab.html#atomicNumber>#$atomicNumber</a> #$Helium 2)
</pre>
which is functional in both of its arguments.  Or, we could have 
<pre>
   (#$AtomicNumberFn #$Helium) -> 2
   (#$AtomicNumberOfFn 2) -> #$Helium
</pre>
<li>There is better indexing support for <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Predicate>#$Predicate</a>s, especially if the
function version would not be reifiable. 
</ol>
