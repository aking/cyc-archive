<p>
The Assertion Diagnostics tool provides the user with an internal, low-level diagnosis of the selected assertion.
<p>
When the Assertion Diagnostics tool is selected, CYC&reg; runs a set of diagnostics on the selected assertion and returns the results.
<p>
The interface for this tool is still in development.  A more detailed description of this tool will be available at a later time.
