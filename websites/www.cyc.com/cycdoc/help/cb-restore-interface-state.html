Since interface settings for the KB Browser are persistent only for a given CYC&reg; Image, NOT for a given CYC&reg user, it is often desirable to save a particular user's preferences for later use.  This facility allows the user to restore options that have already been saved.  To save options instead, go back and choose the "Save Interface Settings" option from the Browser Options page.
<p>
<h3><a name="restore">Restoring User Preferences</a></h3>
<p>
To restore a file of user interface settings, enter into the input window the filename where the settings were previously saved.  The pathname for the file should start with the root node of the user's filesystem.  For example, if user Fred's changes are saved in the file:
<pre>
  /home/Fred/cyc/kb-browser-settings
</pre>
enter that filename into the input window, then press the [<i>Save Settings</i>] button.
<p>
To activate the changes after restoring them, it may be necessary to restart the KB Browser.  A link for doing this is provided after the [<i>Save Settings</i>] button is pressed.
<p>
To clear the input field, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.
<p>
To restore the pathname to its default value, press the [<i>Reset</i>] button.  A default value will not appear if preferences have not been previously restored for this image.
<p>
To cancel the save operation and return to the previous page, press the [<i>Cancel</i>] button.
