The Local Operations page displays the (unprocessed) contents of the local queue, and allows the user to clear the contents of the queue, if desired.  This page will only be accessible when there are operations in the local queue that have not been processed yet.
<p>
<h3><a name="contents">Viewing the Local Queue</a></h3>
<p>
The Local Operations page displays two things:
<ul>
<li>The number of (still unprocessed) operations currently in the local queue.
<li>The operations themselves, in order.  The first operation in the queue will be the next one processed, the last one in the queue will be the last one processed, etc.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="clear">Clearing the Local Queue</a></h3>
<p>
Sometimes it is desirable to clear the entire contents of the local queue.  The most common situation where this might be desired is when:
<ol>
<li>A local operation causes the Agenda to halt (i.e., causes an error).  You can tell this by going to the Agenda Process Control, accessible via the "Agenda" link in the Agenda Status Bar.
<li>The operations in the rest of the queue depend upon the first operation being processed, and may cause errors themselves if allowed to go through without the first one working.
</ol>
<p>
To clear all of the operations in the local queue, press the [<i>Clear Local Queue</i>] button.  A confirmation page is provided in case the user decides not to delete the entire queue after all.
<p>
Note that this will clear every operation in the queue.  If there are some that you wish to save for entry later, you may want to copy them to a temporary file.  To abort out of any error-causing operation (instead of clearing the entire queue), go to the Agenda Process Control and start the Agenda up again.  The operation that caused the error will be aborted.  (This only works if the Agenda is in "Halt and Display Reason" mode.  If the error handling mode is set to "Enter the Debugger", the operation must be dealt with in the window where the CYC&reg; process was started up--most likely an emacs window.)
