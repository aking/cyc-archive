Since interface settings for the KB Browser are persistent only for a given CYC&reg; Image, NOT for a given CYC&reg user, it is often desirable to save a particular user's preferences for later use.  This facility allows the user to do just that.  To restore options that have already been saved, go back and choose the "Restore Interface Settings" option from the Browser Options page.
<p>
<h3><a name="save">Saving User Preferences</a></h3>
<p>
To save a file of current interface settings, enter into the input window the filename where the settings should be saved.  The pathname for the file should start with the root node of the user's filesystem.  For example, user Fred's changes might be saved to the file:
<pre>
  /home/Fred/cyc/kb-browser-settings
</pre>
After entering the filename, press the [<i>Save Settings</i>] button.
<p>
To clear the input field, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.
<p>
To restore the pathname to its default value before editing, press the [<i>Reset</i>] button.  A default value will not appear the first time a particular user's preferences are saved.
<p>
To cancel the save operation and return to the previous page, press the [<i>Cancel</i>] button.
<p>
To restore settings in a later CYC&reg; image after having set them here, choose the "Restore Interface Settings" option from the Browser Options page.
