The <a href="../ref/system.html#com-modes">communication status</a> of a CYC&reg; image determines how operations will be transmitted, received, and recorded by the CYC&reg Agenda.  This page allows the user to change the communication status of the current CYC&reg image.
<p>
<h3><a name="modes">Communication Status</a></h3>
There are two sections that determine your communication status:  
<ol>
<li>What Do You Want To Do With Processed Operations?
<ul>
<li><i>Send Immediately:</i> write (transmit) all local operations to the master transcript as they are processed.
<li><i>Store For Later:</i> write local operations to a local transcript file, these may later be transmitted to the master transcript.
<li><i>Do Not Record:</i> do not make a record of the operations after they have been processed.
</ul>
<li>Do You Want To Receive Operations From Others?
<ul>
<li><i>Yes:</i> receive operations that others have transmitted.
<li><i>No:</i> do not receive operations from others.
</ul>
<li>When you have at least one operation stored, then a third section of the communciation mode page will occur.  This section lists the number of operations you have stored, and gives you the option of either sending your stored operations, or allowing you to clear the operations from the stored queue.  In both cases a new local transcript will be started.  To either send operations or clear the stored queue, select the appropriate button and press the [<i>Submit</i>] button.  
</ol>
<h3><a name="settings">Setting the Communication Status</a></h3>
<p>
To change the communication settings, select the desired setting in each section and click on the  [<i>Submit</i>] button.   The [<i>Current Value</i>] button will restore the previous values for the entire page.
<p>
Note that if your local queue is non-empty (i.e., there are still operations to be processed), you will be unable to change the transmission part of your communication status.
<p>
Communication statuses are described in detail in the <a href="../ref/system.html#com-modes">CYC&reg; Communication Status Documentation</a>.
