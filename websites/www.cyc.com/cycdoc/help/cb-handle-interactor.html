The SubL Interactor is an input window for evaluating SubL expressions.
<p>
<h3><a name="eval">Evaluating Expressions</a></h3>
<p>
To evaluate an expression, simply enter the expression in the window and press the [<i>Eval</i>] button.  This will bring up a new frame which contains the last form (the expression just evaluated), the results of the evaluation, and a fresh input window.  If the expression is malformed an error message is returned.
<p>
To get constant completion while typing in an expression, press the [<i>Complete</i>] button in the middle of a constant name.  As always, possible completions (if there is more than one) will be displayed in a separate completion window which will be reused for future completions. Completion is case sensitive, and requires that JavaScript is  enabled in your browser. 
<p>
To completely refresh the input window and start over, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.
<p>
To return to the previous frame, press the [<i>Back</i>] button.
<p>
