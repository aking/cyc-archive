The Toolbar Frame allows the user to do three things:
<ul>
<li>Search for constants using the input window.
<li>Navigate around the KB Browser via the "Tools" and "Navigator" links.
<li>Access the user login facility via the "Login" link.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="layout" href="(Empty Reference!)">Toolbar Layout</a></h3>
<p>
The layout of the Toolbar depends on whether JavaScript is enabled or not.  With JavaScript on, there will be a single, multi-purpose window (for options 1-4 below); CYC&reg; constant completion (described below) will also be possible.  With JavaScript off, there will be two windows--one for options 1 and 3 (left-hand window), one for option 4 (right-hand window); CYC&reg constant completion will not be available (thus option 2 below is not possible), since it requires JavaScript to run.
<p>
JavaScript can be turned on and off on the Browser Options page, accessible by clicking on the "Options" link on the Toolbar or Browser Tools page.  
<p>
JavaScript is not enabled by default because certain HTML browsers do not support it fully.  To configure your KB Browser to the capabilities of your HTML browser, go to the CYC&reg; Main Menu (click the "Navigator" link to go to the CYC&reg Navigator) and click on "Browser Setup".  The system will determine if your HTML browser supports JavaScript and frames, and configure your KB Browser accordingly.
<p>
<h3><a name="searching" href="(Empty Reference!)">Searching for constants in the KB:</a></h3>
<p>
There are four ways to search using the input window:
<ol>
<li>Enter a complete constant name, then press the [<i>Show</i>] button.  (Use the left-hand window with JavaScript off.)  There are four versions of this search:
  <ul>
  <li>Entering a constant name without "#$&quot; (e.g. Foo) uses a case-insensitive lookup, with help from the lexicon.
  <li>Entering a constant name with "#$&quot; (e.g. #$Foo) uses exact, case-sensitive lookup.
  <li>If an entry is preceded by a left parenthesis (e.g. (#$FooFn #$Bar)), an exact, case-sensitive lookup is used to find the specified reified <a href="../ref/glossary.html#NAT">NAT</a>.
  <li>If an entry is in double quotes (e.g. "foo bar"), the system uses only the lexicon to find constants.  This option is only available in versions of CYC&reg; containing the lexicon code.
  </ol>
<li>Enter the first part of a constant name and press the [<i>Complete</i>] button.  Then press the [<i>Show</i>] button.  Possible completions will be displayed in a separate completion window which will be reused for future completions.  Completion is case sensitive, and requires that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.  (This option is not available with JavaScript turned off.) 
<li>Enter a substring of a constant name, using "*" as a wildcard at the tail end of the string (or at both ends) to represent unspecified characters in the string.  Then press the [<i>Show</i>] button.  Substrings must be at least 3 characters long for this to work.  (Use the left-hand window with JavaScript off.)
<li>Enter a <a href="grep-chart.html">UNIX regular expression</a> and press the [<i>GREP</i>] button.  Clicking on the "Ignore Case" button causes the GREP search to become case-insensitive, unclicking makes it sensitive to case.  The default setting is to ignore case.  In general, the GREP search is faster than the wildcard method mentioned above.  However, since the constant search list for the GREP facility is only updated when a new CYC&reg; world is created, the wildcard method may reflect changes to constant names faster than the GREP facility.  For help with UNIX regular expressions, click <a href="grep-chart.html">here</a>.  (Use the right-hand window with JavaScript off.)
</ol>
If any of the above searches yields more than one possible constant, a list of constants will be displayed.  Clicking on the desired constant will display the entry for that constant.
<p>
<h3><a name="navigating" href="(Empty Reference!)">Navigating Around the KB Browser</a></h3>
<p>
To reach other tools accessible from the KB Browser, click on the "Tools" link.  This will take you to the Browser Tools page, where you can either continue on to another tool, or modify the Browser Toolbar so that links to desired tools appear directly in the Toolbar Frame, thus becoming more readily accessible.
<p>
The help page page for the Browser Tools explains each of the available tools in more detail.
<p>
The CYC&reg; Navigator is a useful launching pad for accessing the rest of the CYC&reg System.  To reach it, simply click on the "Navigator" link on the Toolbar or Browser Tools pages.
<p>
Interface preferences for the KB Browser can be set by going to the Browser Options page, accessible via the "Options" link on the Toolbar or Browser Tools pages.
<p>
<h3><a name="login" href="(Empty Reference!)">Login</a></h3>
<p>
In order to fully access all areas of the KB Browser, it is necessary to first login as a CYC&reg; user.
The "Login" link in the Toolbar lists the current user, and connects to the Login Area, where new users can login to CYC&reg;.  
<p>
<h3><a name="other" href="(Empty Reference!)">Other Information</a></h3>
<p>
Clicking on "Update" refreshes the Toolbar Frame.  This link will not appear if JavaScript is turned off.   If frames are not being used, this link will also not appear; use the "Update" link in the Agenda Status Bar to refresh the entire page.
<p>
"Machine" lists the machine on which the CYC&reg; Process is running.
