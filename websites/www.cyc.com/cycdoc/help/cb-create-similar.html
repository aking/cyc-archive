This tool allows the user to create a new constant similar to the displayed constant, and to choose which of the assertions involving the displayed constant to copy over to the new constant.  Copying assertions over to a new constant simply means that the new assertions will have the new constant name substituted in for the old.
<p>
To create a new constant similar to the selected constant, proceed as follows:
<ol>
<li>Enter the name of the new constant into the input window.  This must be a new constant name. If the new constant name is similar to an existing constant, you can take advantage of constant completion by completing on the existing constant name and then editing to create the new constant name.  
<li>All copiable assertions involving the selected constant are displayed at the bottom of the page.  Select the assertions that you wish to copy over to the new constant by selecting the check boxes to the left of the assertions.  
<li>Press the [<i>Create Similar</i>] button.  This will create the new constant and copy over the selected assertions. 
</ol>
<p>
To clear the input field and start over, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.
<p>
To cancel the creation of a new constant and return to the previous page, press the [<i>Cancel Create</i>] button.
