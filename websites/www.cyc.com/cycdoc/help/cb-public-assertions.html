<p>
Public constants are those constants which are part of the <a href="http://www.cyc.com/public.html">Upper CYC&reg; Ontology</a>.  All public constants should have the marker "PUBLIC" when their Definitional Info is displayed in the KB Browser, and all should be elements of the collection <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#PublicConstant>#$PublicConstant</a> in the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a>.
<p>
Public assertions are those assertions which contain only public constants.  The "Public Assertions(?)" link in the Term Index for a given constant computes and displays the public assertions which involve that constant.  The "?" is used because the public assertions for a constant are not computed ahead of time.
