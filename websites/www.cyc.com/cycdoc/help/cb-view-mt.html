<h3><a name="filters">Microtheories as Filters</a></h3>
<p>
The Filter Mt tool is a way of using a selected <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a> (or a subset of microtheories or all
microtheories) as a filter for viewing assertions and constants in the
KB Browser.
<p>
The default setting is "All Mts", which means that no filter is being
used, and assertions from all microtheories will be displayed when a
constant is viewed in the Main Display Frame.  
<p>
Selecting one or more particular microtheories as a filter will cause
two things to happen:
<ol>
<li>Index catagories in the Term Index will be filtered with respect
to the chosen microtheory.  That is, the Term Index will behave as if
the displayed constant only has assertions in the chosen microtheory and the
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a>.  All other assertions involving the constant will be ignored
by the Term Index.
<li>Assertions in the Main Display Frame will be filtered with respect
to the chosen microtheory.  That is, only those assertions in the
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a> and the chosen Mt will be displayed.  All other assertions
involving the constant will not show up in the Main Display Frame.<br>
</ol>
 
<h3><a name="select">Selecting a Microtheory</a></h3>
<p>
The "Filter Mts" page includes a list of microtheories which contain assertions
involving the given constant.  To change the setting from "All Mts" and choose one or more of these microtheories as
a filter, select "Specify Mts" and then select the check box to the left of the desired
microtheory, then press the [<i>Update Current Mts</i>] button.  
<p>
The Term Index and Main Display Frame will reflect the changedFilter Mts setting until the user changes the settings again (i.e., selects a different filter or restores the "All Mts" setting) or until the image is restarted. 
<p>
To reset the check boxes to their prior settings, press the
[<i>Current Values</i>] button.
