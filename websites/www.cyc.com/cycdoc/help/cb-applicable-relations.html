Applicable Relations provides a list of every relation for which the given term could possibly be an argument.  
<p>
The list is organized into sections based on which argument position the term could occupy (e.g., "Arg 1", "Arg 2", "Arg 3").  Every term will have <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> under its Arg 1 section.  All binary predicates will have <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg1Isa>#$arg1Isa</a> under their Arg 1 section and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg2Isa>#$arg2Isa</a> under their Arg 2 section.  Particular places (e.g., #$CityOfParisFrance) will have <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#eventOccursAt>#$eventOccursAt</a> under their Arg 2 section, and particular agents (e.g., #$Lenat) will have <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#doneBy>#$doneBy</a> under their Arg 2 section.
<p>
Within each section, relations are sorted very roughly as follows: more specific
relations come first in the list and more general ones come later.
<p>

Next to some relations in the list are "+" links for processing that relation using the Literal Query tool.  In general, the Literal Query tool asks CYC&reg; to compute more queries of a specific type. (See the <a href="cb-literal-query.html">Literal Query Help</a> for details.)</p>  
<p>
Example: if #$Lenat is displayed in the KB Browser, and we click on Applicable Relations, we will see  every  relation in CYC&reg; that could possibly applyto Lenat.  One of those relations should be <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#mother>#$mother</a>.  Clicking on the "+" next to mother will initiate the ask:
<pre>
  (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#mother>#$mother</a> #$Lenat ?ARG2)
</pre>
to see if CYC&reg; can compute any bindings for that value.
<p>
The different colors specify the likelihood that an answer can be concluded:
 <blockquote>

<img src=/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-yellow.gif>
 : CYC&reg; already has assertions asserted and indexed like this.<br>

<img src=/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-green.gif>
 : CYC&reg; has HL methods available which make it VERY likely an answer can be calculated. <br>

<img src=/cycdoc/img/cb/plus-purple.gif>
 : It's possible but unlikely that a value can be calculated. <br>
No + : There's no way for CYC&reg; to conclude this relation.
