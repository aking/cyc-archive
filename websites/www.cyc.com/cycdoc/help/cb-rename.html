<p> <b>Important: before renaming any CYC&reg; constant, be sure to
read the document <a href="../ref/renames-kills.html">Renaming and
Killing Constants</a>, and follow the procedures outlined there.</b>

<p><h3><a name="rename">Renaming a Constant</a></h3>

<p> To rename a constant in the KB, enter the new constant name into
the input window, then press the [<i>Rename</i>] button.

<p> This renames the constant in the KB, but leaves intact all
assertions involving the constant.  In this way, using the Rename
Constant facility is far preferable to killing a constant and then
re-creating it under a new name, which will cause all assertions
involving it to be deleted and lost.

<p> To take advantage of constant completion, enter the first part of
a microtheory name, then press the [<i>Complete</i>] button.

<p> To clear the input field and start over, press the [<i>Clear</i>]
button.

<p> To restore the constant name in the input field to its value
before editing, press the [<i>Current Name</i>] button.

<p> To abort the rename completely and return to the previous page,
press the [<i>Cancel Rename</i>] button.

<p> For information on naming strategies for CYC&reg; constants, see
<a href="../ref/cycl-syntax.html#constant names">The Syntax of
CycL</a>.
