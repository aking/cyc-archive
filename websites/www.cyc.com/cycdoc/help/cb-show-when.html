The Display by Date facility allows the user to find and display constants or assertions based on the date of their entry into the KB.  Simply specify the kind of object to display (constant or assertion), starting and ending dates, and whether to limit the search to any particular cyclist (knowledge-entry person).
<p>
<h3><a name="data">Constant vs. Assertion</a></h3>
<p>
To search for constants, click on the button to the left of "Constants"; to search for assertions, click on the button for "Assertions".  It is not possible to search for both at the same time.
<p>
<h3><a name="dates">Dates to Search</a></h3>
<p>
You can limit the search by choosing start and ending dates.  The search will return all constants or assertions created between (and including) those dates.  Setting the start and ending dates to the same date will search over that date only.  The default value for both start and ending dates is today's date.
<p>

<h3><a name="cyclist">Cyclist to Examine</a></h3>
<p>
If you want to search for constants or assertions created by a specific user, you can enter that user's CYC&reg; constant (minus the "#$&quot;) in the input window.  The default value is the CYC&reg constant of whatever user is logged into the current CYC&reg; image.  The search can be further restricted by setting the start and ending dates, described above.  
<p>
After setting the search parameters, display the assertions by pressing the [<i>Submit</i>] button.
<p>
To reset the parameters to their default values, press the [<i>Reset</i>] button.
