This facility allows the user to search through an alphabetical list of constants. 
<p>
<h3><a name="search">Searching the Index</a></h3>
<p>
The search usually starts with a root node.  There are two main ways of selecting this node:
<ul>
<li>A string was entered into the Toolbar input window that CYC&reg; was unable to match with a constant in the KB.  In this case the Alphabetical Search is brought up with the phrase "[string] would be here" inserted where [string] would fall in the Alphabetical index were [string] to be a constant name.  [string] is then the root node.
<li>The "A" icon

 next to a constant name is clicked.  In this case the Alphabetical Search is brought up with the selected constant as the root node.
</ul>
<p>
Constant names beginning with lowercase letters are listed after uppercase ones.  Thus "Z" comes before "a".
<p>
Click on the "Page Up" link to see the set of constant names immediately previous in the alphabet to the displayed set.
<p>
Click on the "Page Down" link to see the set of constant names immediately following in the alphabet to the displayed set.
<p>
"Top" takes you to the beginning of the alphabetical listing.
<p>
"Bottom" takes you to the end of the alphabetical listing.
<p>
Use the list of uppercase and lowercase letters to jump to that part of the alphabet.
<p>
As usual, click on a constant name to see that constant displayed in the KB Browser.
<p>
Click on the red diamond 
<img src=/cycdoc/img/cb/red_diam.gif>
 to view that constant using the Hierarchy Browser.
