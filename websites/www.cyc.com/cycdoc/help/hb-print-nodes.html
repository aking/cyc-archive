<h3><a name="hb-browser">The CYC&reg; Hierarchy Browser</a></h3>
<p>
This page displays a subset of CYC&reg; assertions in indented
hierarchical form.  The hierarchy is constructed by
beginning from a specified starting (or "pivot") term, and
recursively following a specified binary relation from the
starting term to "superior" and "inferior" terms.
<p>
When a starting term is selected and the command to display
a hierarchy is given, the upper leftward ("superior") part
of the hierarchy is computed first.  This part of the
hierarchy is then partially compressed in an effort to
quickly remove some redundant information, and is displayed.
Next the starting term is displayed.  Finally, the lower
rightward ("inferior") part of the hierarchy is computed and
displayed.
<p>
<h3><a name="links">Links from the KB Browser</a></h3>
<p>
On several of Cyc's web browser interface pages, certain
terms are displayed with a small red diamond to the
immediate left of the term.  Clicking on this small red
diamond will cause a hierarchical display for the term to be
constructed.
<p>
<h3><a name="settings">Hierarchy Browser Settings</a></h3>
<p>
To specify a new starting term or to change other Hierarchy
Browser settings, click on the [<i>Change Hierarchy Browser Settings</i>] button.

Browser's features, see the help link on the Hierarchy Browser Parameters page,

Hierarchy Browser, or to customize your Hierarchy Browser's
symbols or colors, go to the page accessible via the button
