<p><h3><a name="kill">Killing a Constant</a></h3>

<p> Killing a constant removes it from the KB; any assertions which
involve it are also removed.  The number of assertions involving the
constant will be listed along with the constant to be killed.

<p> It is impossible to reverse a kill (short of creating a new
constant by the same name and reasserting every assertion which
involved the old constant), so it is very important to be sure that
killing is what is desired.

<p> To remove the constant from the KB and delete all assertions
involving it, press the [<i>Yes, Kill</i>] button. The number of
assertions that will be removed are listed just above the confirmation
buttons.

<p> To leave the constant intact and return to the previous frame,
press the [<i>No</i>] button.

<p><h3><a name="recreate">Recreating a Constant</a></h3>

<p> Killing a constant removes it from the KB entirely.  If a new
constant is then created with the same name (i.e., the constant was
killed to remove all of its assertions and allow the user to start
over), it will be created with a new constant ID but the same name,
which might be problematic.

<p> A better approach is to use the Recreate Constant tool, which
removes from the KB all of the assertions involving that constant,
while leaving the constant itself intact.  This is a much cleaner and
safer way to start over.

<p> To reach the Recreate Constant tool, click on the "Recreate" link.
