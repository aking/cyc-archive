The Constant Diagnostics tool provides the user with an internal, low-level diagnosis of the selected constant.
<p>
When the Constant Diagnostics tool is selected, CYC&reg; computes which diagnostics would be appropriate for the given constant, and displays these in a list.
<p>
To run diagnostics on the constant, click on the checkbox next to any (every) diagnostic you desire to have run, then press the [<i>Do it!</i>] button.  CYC&reg; will run all of the diagnostics you have selected and return the results.
<p>
To return the checkboxes to their values before any diagnostics were selected or unselected, press the [<i>Current Values</i>] button.
<p>
To cancel the diagnostics completely, press the [<i>Cancel</i>] button.
<p>
Detailed descriptions of the different diagnostics and possible results will be available at a later time.
