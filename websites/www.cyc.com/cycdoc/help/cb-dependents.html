<h3><a name="dependents">Assertion Dependents</a></h3>
<p>
Certain assertions in CYC&reg; are used to conclude new assertions.  Those new assertions are the dependents of the original assertion, because they are dependent upon its existence for their own.   If the original assertion is deleted, its dependents will also be deleted unless they can still be derived from another source.
<p>
Dependents are essentially the converse of arguments.  That is, if assertion A is an argument for assertion B, then B is a dependent of A.  For more information on arguments, see the <a href="cb-arguments.html">Arguments Help</a>.
<p>
Not all assertions in CYC&reg; will have dependents, since many conclusions are not drawn until backchaining is applied during inference, and CYC&reg does not necessarily permanently store those conclusions.
<p>
This page lists the original assertion, followed by all of its immediate dependents.  Each of the dependents is numbered, simply for reference by the user.
<p>
A single dependent would be listed as follows:
<pre>
  1 : Deduced #3565200 supporting :
     [Dependent-Assertion-1]
</pre>
Clicking on "Deduced" shows in more detail the argument source for that deduced/dependent assertion.
