<p>
To change the assertion strength of the displayed assertion, select a new truth strength (Default or Monotonic), then press the [<i>Change Strength</i>] button.  The assertion itself is displayed in its EL form at the bottom of the page.
<p>
This will delete the assertion from the KB, and reassert it with the new strength.  This is better than using the Assert Similar Formula facility, since it is usually undesirable to have the same formula asserted with two different strengths at the same time.
<p>
Since changing the truth value of an assertion from TRUE to FALSE or vice-versa is effectively reversing the assertion, that kind of change is not allowed through this facility.  Only the truth strength of the assertion can be changed here, not the complete truth value.  To change the truth value (not strength), go back to the Assertion Display Frame, click on "Edit", and change the truth value.  For help with the Edit Formula tool, see the <a href="cb-assert-internal.html>Edit Assertion Help</a>.
<p>
To restore the setting for assertion strength to its value before editing, press the [<i>Current Value</i>] button.  
<p>
To abort the edit completely and return to the previous page, press the [<i>Abort Edit</i>] button.
