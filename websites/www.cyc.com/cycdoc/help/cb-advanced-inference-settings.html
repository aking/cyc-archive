<h3><a name="advanced">Some Advanced Settings</a></h3>
<p>
The advanced inference settings are for users who are quite familiar
with the CYC&reg; System, especially the inference engine and its
capabilities.  Most users will not need to change the advanced
settings from their defaults. 
<p>
There are several settings listed on the Advanced Inference Settings
page.  Their descriptions are listed on that page, and will not be
reproduced here.
<p>

<h3><a name="updating">Changing the Settings</a></h3>
<p>
To change any of the settings, select the desired radio button, then
press the [<i>Update Parameters</i>] button.  Doing so will make all
changes at once, so be sure that each of the settings is as desired
before updating the parameters.
<p>
The [<i>Current Values</i>] button will revert all radio buttons to
the initial state they were in when this page was displayed.
