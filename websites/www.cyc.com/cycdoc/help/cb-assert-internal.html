This page offers help for three different tools that are essentially the same to use:
<ul>
<li>Assert Formula
<li>Assert Similar Formula
<li>Edit Assertion
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="tools">Assert, Assert Similar, Edit</a></h3>
<p>
All three tools have the exact same interface, and all result in a formula being asserted to the KB.  However, there are a few key differences in how they operate:
<ul>
<li>Assert Formula allows the user to enter a completely new formula.  As such, there are no defaults for the input fields, except for Strength, which is set to Default.  
<li>Edit Assertion allows the user to edit an assertion already existing in the KB.  Assertions edited using the Edit Assertion tool will be deleted from the KB, and the new version will be asserted in its place.  The various parts of the original assertion are used as defaults for the input fields, including the formula, microtheory, strength, and direction.
<li>Assert Similar Formula allows the user to add a new formula similar to one already existing in the KB.  Assertions edited using the Assert Similar Formula will NOT be deleted from the KB.  Instead, the old assertion will remain in the KB, and the new version will be asserted as well.  As with the Edit Assertion tool, the various parts of the original assertion are used as defaults for the input fields.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="changes">Adding and Editing</a></h3>
<p>
To add a new assertion, simply enter the relevant information into each of the input fields provided, then press the [<i>Perform Edit</i>] button.  Leaving the Direction field unchecked will cause the default values for that type of assertion to be used (GAFs: forward, rules: backward). 
<p>
To edit an assertion, simply change the information provided, either by editing the text or by clicking the appropriate button.  To assert the formula, press the [<i>Perform Edit</i>] button.
<p>
To delete an assertion, go to the Assertion Display Frame for the selected assertion and click on "Unassert" (local assertions) or "Blast" (deduced assertions).  See the <a href="cb-af.html">help page for the Assertion Display Frame</a> for details on deleting or blasting assertions. 
<p>
To restore input fields to their values before editing, press the [<i>Reset</i>] button.  
<p>
To abort the edit completely and return to the previous page, press the [<i>Abort Edit</i>] button.
<p>
<h3><a name="fields">The Input Fields</a></h3>
<p>
The interface for the three tools contains a number of input fields:
<ul>
<li>Mt: enter the microtheory (minus the "#$&quot;) in which the formula is to be asserted.  To take advantage of constant completion, enter a partial microtheory name and press the [<i>Complete</i>] button.  Remember that a list of completions will appear in a separate HTML browser window if the completion is not unique.
<li>EL Formula: enter the formula, using CycL syntax (which utilizes the "#$&quot;).  To take advantage of constant completion, type the first part of a CYC&reg; constant in the input window, then  press the [<i>Complete</i>] button.  
<li>Strength: choose either Default or Monotonic, choosing both is not possible.  False assertions (which it is rare to enter) can be made using <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a>.
<li>Direction: choose either Backward or Forward, choosing both is not possible.  If no value is selected (only an option for new assertions), the default values for that type of assertion will be used (GAFs: forward, rules: backward). 
</ul>
<p>
For more information on CycL syntax, assertions, microtheories, strengths, and directions, see <a href="../ref/cycl-syntax.html">The Syntax of CycL</a>.
