<h2>Cycorp Course Description</h2>

<h2><i>Introduction to the Cyc Knowledge Server</i></h2>


<h2>Cyc Overview and Historical Introduction</h2>
Lecture<p>

<a name="CycLSyntax">
<p><br>
<h2>CycL Syntax</h2>
Lecture<p>

The "CycL Syntax" talk will detail the rules for constructing terms,
basic formulas, sentences and complex assertions in CycL.  CycL is a
formal language that is modelled after the language of first-order
predicate calculus.  It is, however, a far more expressive language,
and consequently it is a more complex language.  Although the syntax
of CycL is very much like that of first-order logic, it differs in
some important ways and even those who are well-versed in the syntax
of first-order logic will benefit from this discussion.  For those who
have no training in formal logic, this talk will provide the necessary
foundation for becoming proficient in the language of CycL.

<a name="isaandgenls">
<p><br>
<h2>Ontology Basics: Collections and Individuals: using #$isa and #$genls in CycL</h2>
Lecture<p>

In this section we introduce two of the most basic (and powerful)
distinctions in Cyc.  First we look at the distinction between
collections and individuals. Topics covered include some defining
features of each, examples, how collections differ from sets, and the
importance of distinguishing the collection level from the individual
level in writing CycL.  Second we look at the predicates #$isa and
#$genls.  Topics covered include the meaning and use of these
predicates (including examples), the distinction between them,
argument types, and transitivity.

<p><br>

<p><br>
<h2>CycL Translations, Basic Assertions</h2>
Exercise<p>

<a name="InterfaceOverview">
<p><br>
<h2>Interface Overview and Browsing the KB</h2>
Lecture<p>

In this section students will be introduced to the Cyc Interface:
the point of contact between Cyc and the new and future Cyclists
(Cyc users).  Points covered will be finding constants, reading
assertions, locating a constant within Cyc's ontological hierarchy,
and using basic tools to ask questions and to edit the knowledge base.
In addition, students will log on and off, view transcripts of their
local operations, and find out how to erase transcripts they do not 
intend to send.

<p><br>
<h2>Browsing, Finding Assertions, and Editing the KB</h2>
Exercise<p>

<a name="MajorPartitionsAndDistinctions">
<p><br>
<h2>Major KB Partitions and The Stuff/Object Distinction</h2>
Lecture<p>

This lecture is an introduction to the top-level distinctions in the Cyc
ontology.  The talk will cover three pairs of collections, each of which
partition #$Thing, the topmost collection in Cyc:  (1) #$SetOrCollection
vs. #$Individual; (2) #$Intangible vs. #$PartiallyTangible; (3) 
#$TangibleThing vs. #$PartiallyIntangible.  We will also discuss some
partitions that Cyc doesn't have, to illustrate good vs. bad criteria
for reifying collections.
<p>
This lecture also deals with the distinction between StuffType and
ObjectType collections. We will talk about spatial stuff/object
properties and temporal stuff/object properties. Issues of
granularity will also be discussed.  In addition to outlining the
distinction between Stuff-like properties and Object-like properties,
this lecture will give students in-depth exposure to the concept of
type collections.

<p>
<h1>Fundamentals of Knowledge Engineering with Cyc</h1>
<p>

<a name="KR1">
<h2>Events, Predicates, and Roles</h2>
Lecture<p>

The purpose of this talk is to acquaint the attendee with the way
different kinds of participants in situations are represented in
Cyc. After introducing some examples of the many ways things can
participate in situations, we introduce the representation system used
in Cyc. We go over the distinction between #$actors and #$subEvents,
show how #$Roles are implemented as relations between #$Situations and
participants, and show how #$Roles are inferentially related to each
other and to other predicates via the #$genlPreds hierarchy.

<p><br>
<h2>Representing Roles in Events</h2>
Exercise<p>

<a name="PredicatesAndFunctions">
<p><br>
<h2>Predicates and Functions</h2>
Lecture<p>

In this section we review the basics of denotational functions in Cyc.
Topics covered include non-atomic terms (NATs), arity, argument types,
result types, system use of #$termOfUnit, and browsing NATs in the KB.
We look at some examples of proper and improper function use.  We also
look at some of the specializations of #$Function-Denotational, such
as #$IndividualDenotingFunction, #$CollectionDenotingFunction, and
#$ReifiableFunction.

<a name="Attributes">
<p><br>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
Lecture<p>

What are Attributes?  They are intangible, individual values
that are used to describe properties, qualities or characteristics
of some object.  #$GreenColor is an #$AttributeValue.  #$Married and
#$Single are #$AttributeValues.  "Five inches" is also an
#$AttributeValue.  This lecture discusses the main types of attributes,
how they are arranged into hierarchies, and how they can be ordered.
Because measurable quantities are represented as attributes, an
important part of this lecture concerns units of measure, measurable
quantities, and comparisons of quantities. 

<a name="In">
<p><br>
<h2>KB Content: The Representation of "In"</h2>
Lecture<p>

This lecture provides an overview of the many ways distinct "contained
in" relations are represented in Cyc.  For example, there is an
ontological difference between what it is to be "contained in"
something as an <i>ingredient</i>, and what it is to be "contained in"
a package.  And there's a difference between the way one is "in" when
one is "in" clothing and the way one is "in" when one is "in" a
swimming pool.  Cyc contains dozens of specific predicates to capture
the logical features of many different containment relations.  This
lecture provides an excellent example of just how carefully
distinctions are drawn when developing Cyc knowledge base content.

<a name="ConceptualWorks">
<p><br>
<h2>The Representation of Literary, Audio, and Visual Works</h2>
Lecture<p>

This talk provides an overview of Cyc's ontology of abstract works such
as  novels, movies and television series. Various difficulties arise in
representing these works that do not occur when representing such
concrete works as paintings or buildings. This area of the ontology was
recently revised when our older, simpler, techniques proved inadequate
to support various types of common sense inferences. The talk describes
an example of how Cyc's ontology develops in response to the need to
improve its ability to reason about objects in a particular domain.

<a name="MTs">
<p><br>
<h2>Microtheories</h2>
Lecture<p>

This lecture provides an overview of microtheories
as they are currently (early 2000) implemented and
used in the Cyc KB.  Questions addressed include
the following:
<ul>
  <li>What are microtheories? 
  <li>Why have them at all? 
  <li>What are some common types of microtheories in Cyc?
  <li> What can we say about microtheories in CycL?
  <li> How are microtheories used in inferencing?
</ul>
The rationale for covering this material at all,
in light of the changes to our implementation of
microtheories anticipated for this year, is that
most of the people attending the course will
probably soon be using a Cyc System that
incorporates our current implementation.

<a name="RuleMacroPredicates">
<p><br>
<h2>Rule Macro Predicates</h2>
Lecture<p>

#$RuleMacroPredicates are predicates that have, implicit in their
definition, the schema for a class of quantified formulas.  A ground
formula using a #$RuleMacroPredicate actually represents a more complex,
quantified formula.  This lecture presents some examples of
#$RuleMacroPredicate, and discusses several ways #$RuleMacroPredicates can be
implemented.  By "implemented", we mean have the system behave so that the
addition of a #$RuleMacroPredicate ground formula results in the conclusions
that would be entailed by the more complicated formula the
#$RuleMacroPredicate ground formula is shorthand for.

<p><br>

<a name="KR2">
<p><br>
<h2>Time and Dates</h2>
Lecture<p>

Representing and reasoning about time and dates remains one of the
most challenging aspects of Cyc-based reasoning; it is also an area
where some very significant KR issues are still in the process of being
resolved, involving some very significant assumptions about Cyc
collections and their extensions.
<p>This section will look at the major
specializations of the Cyc collection TemporalThing, at the definitions
and taxonomization of the PrimitiveTemporalRelations and
ComplexTemporalRelations, and at the issues surrounding temporal
qualification of Cyc assertions, with particular focus being given to the
entity/subabstraction distinction, temporal qualification predicates such
as 'holds in', and the question of whether or not Collections in Cyc have
mutable extensions. Some time will also be spent in discussing potential
ramifications of the impending microtheory cleanup and implementation of
context-Space-based reasoning for temporal qualification in Cyc. 

<a name="tips">
<p><br>
<h2>Tips for Writing Efficient CycL</h2>
Lecture<p>

CycL is a complex and featureful representation language with multiple
ways available for expressing a piece of knowledge.  However,
different CycL representations can differ dramatically in either their
ability to be efficiently used by the inference engine or their
ability to be used, understood and extended by human editors.  The
purpose of this talk is to provide concrete suggestions for how to
write efficient CycL which will make maximal use of this power and
avoid the most common pitfalls.

<p><br>

<a name="mistakes">
<p><br>
<h2>Mistakes to Avoid in Knowledge Entry</h2>
Lecture<p>
This lecture exposes prospective ontological engineers to the kinds of
knowledge entry mistakes commonly made by people new to the Cyc
system.  Some error-types focused on include the tendency to develop
non-modular representations, the tendency to develop overly specific
(hence non-use-neutral) representations, and the tendency to be
overly vague.

<p><br>

<a name="Cyc HPSG Parser">
<p><br>
<h2>The Cyc HPSG Parser (with demo)</h2>
Lecture and Demonstration<p>

Conversion of English input into CycL is performed a number of different
ways by a number of different tools. One of the latest of these is the
Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar English-to-CycL parsing system. This
system is based on a principled English lexicon and grammar, and uses a
unification chart parser to construct structures that map an input string
onto a syntactic and semantic representation. A post-processing module
handles tense, quantification, modals, etc., and presents the output in a
variety of useful formats. The system will be described and a short
demonstration given.

<p><br>

<a name="RKF_Tools">
<p><br>
<h2>Rapid Knowledge Formation Tools</h2>
Lecture and Demonstration<p>
Very few human beings are able to learn to perform the knowledge
engineering (KEing) task well.  A skilled knowledge engineer can spend
time with a subject matter expert (SME) and rapidly extract a useful
model of a domain.  Studying what good knowledge engineers (KE's) do
when they spend time with SME's shows them engaging in back-and-forth
clarification dialogue, building up models by analogy, sketching,
discussing real and hypothetical cases of interest, etc.  These are
all very knowledge-rich tasks.  At Cycorp, we are building tools to
replace the human KE in the knowledge acquisition process, in order
for SME's to be able to quickly build large knowledge based systems
themselves.  This talk is an introduction to Cycorp's knowledge-rich
KEing power tools.

<p><br>

<a name="canonical">
<p><br>
<h2>The Cyc Canonicalizer: System Internals & Finding Assertions</h2>
Lecture<p>

This talk will introduce the audience to the Cyc canonicalizer.  The
canonicalizer is one of the subsystems that comprise the Cyc inference
engine.  Its mission is to translate formulas from the conventional
notation of first-order logic into canonical forms that are used by the
Cyc inference engine.  This target audience of this talk includes all
potential users of, and contributors to, the Cyc knowledge base.

The goals of this talk include:
<ul>
<li>explaining why and when and how formulas are canonicalized
<li>identifying how the representation of formulas may be changed
    by the canonicalizer, and explainng how users can find formulas they
    have just entered in spite of these changes
<li>emphasizing the dependence of canonicalization on the Cyc knowledge base
</ul>

<p><br>

<a name="Server">
<p><br>
<h2>Cyc as a Knowledge Server</h2>
Lecture<p>
Being related to large databases, Cyc as a large knowledge base must solve
issues of knowledge replication and distribution. Furthermore, in order to
permit collaboration both within the company and with VARs, Cyc must
provide support for excising and rejoining knowledge. This lecture covers
the transcript server, Cyc's knowledge replication mechanism, and the
various knowledge formats for ontology excising and rejoining, such as
transcripts, KE files, worlds and partitions.

<p><br>

<a name="Inferencing">
<p><br>
<h2>Inferencing In Cyc</h2>
Lecture<p>
The Cyc inference engine handles modus ponens and modus tollens
(contrapositive) inferencing, universal and existential
quantification, and mathematical inferencing.  The Cyc knowledge base
contains hundreds of thousands of assertions. Many approaches commonly
taken by other inference engines just don't scale well to KBs of this
size. As a result, the Cyc team has been forced to develop other
techniques.  This session is an introduction to those techniques.

<p><br>

<a name="indexing">
<p><br>
<h2>HL Modules & KB Indexing</h2>
Lecture<p>

Cyc is a large knowledge base with tens of thousands of constants
interrelated by hundreds of thousands of assertions and logical
deductions.  The purpose of this talk is elaborate on two important
mechanisms used to manage this complexity efficiently -- HL modules
and KB indexing.
<p>
HL modules are the hundreds of independent code modules which perform
inference in Cyc.  Each module is designed to perform one specialized
form of inferencing as efficiently as possible.  The talk will
introduce the user to HL modules, explain the motivation for them, and
describe how they interact with inference and truth maintenance in
Cyc.
<p>
KB indexing allows for subsets of the knowledge base with an important
common property to be efficiently identified and accessed.  The talk
will describe the kinds of indexing currently used in Cyc and the
interaction of indexing with knowledge representation and inference.

<p><br>

<a name="ITE">
<p><br>
<h2>The Inference Tree Examiner</h2>
Lecture<p>

Backward inferencing in Cyc can be considered as a search through a
tree, where the nodes in the tree are CycL assertions for which
bindings are sought and links between nodes are assertions in the Cyc
knowledge base that help provide bindings for the nodes.  The
inference tree examiner is a tool that provides a hyper-linked
text-based inference tree representation.  It is extremely useful for
debugging inferences by finding points of failure in seemingly
promising paths through the tree.

<p><br>

<a name="NL">
<p><br>
<h2>Overview of Cyc NL</h2>
Lecture<p>

This talk will introduce natural language processing using the Cyc system. 
Both understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) will be covered, with the
focus being on NLU. Each component of the system (lexicon, parser, grammar
rules, semantic combination rules) will be explained, and we will work
through a couple of examples that show how the Cyc knowledge base and
inference engine are used to do natural language disambiguation.

<p><br>
<h2>Rapid Knowledge Formation and Natural Language </h2>
Lecture<p>

This talk will describe how the Cyc Natural Language tools are utilized by the
Rapid Knowledge Formation (RKF) system, both as they are presently
implemented and as they are envisioned.  We will start with an explanation
and demonstration of the existing prototype system that will serve as the
basis for the enhanced NL system that is envisioned for RKF. Following
that, we will discuss of some of the limitations of the existing system,
as well as our plans to address these problems.  This will also include a
discussion of how the various NL systems will work among themselves, as

<h2>An HL Module That Uses the Web</h2>
Demonstration<p>

This session demonstrates how Cyc can use information in a
data source external to the Cyc knowledge base.  For example, the
evolving information on an external web site can provide bindings for
variables in a Cyc-driven inference.

<h2>The Cyc API and Toolkits</h2>
Lecture<b> -- Programmer Track</b><p>

This session describes the Cyc Application Programming Interface (API),
which is the external interface to Cyc. It explores the API protocols
involved, and demonstrates their usage in toolkits, as well as the
motivation for using them.

Of interest to everyone, this session is especially valuable for Cyc
integrators and for Cyc application developers.
