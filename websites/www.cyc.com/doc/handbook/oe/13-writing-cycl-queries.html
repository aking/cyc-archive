Conditional Queries
</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
The terminology used in this document to refer to different types of
queries is:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
"ASK"   -> General-purpose query</li>
        <li>
"PROVE" -> Conditional query</li>
        <li>
"QUERY" -> Could be either of the above</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
They will be used in all capitals to distingish them from the common
usage of these words.</p>
    <p>
Before explaining conditional queries, some explanation of Cyc's
general-purpose inference mechanism is required.</p>
    <h3>13.1.1.  <a NAME='137163488'>
General-purpose queries (ASK)
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The functionality of Cyc's general-purpose inference mechanism is
focused on generating unique proofs that sets of closed terms unify
with the free variables of a query.  This is an ASK.</p>
    <p>
For example, ASKing the query</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)
  in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is a request to generate sets of bindings for the free variables such
as the following</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ((?WHAT . Manitoba-CanadianProvince))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
along with a complete deductive justification for each one.  In the
Cyc Browser, the binding sets are presented as a table, with the
columns being the free variables.</p>
    <p>
ASKing</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (thereExists ?WHAT
    (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT))
  in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
results in an identical proof being performed except that, by
convention, the bindings for a successful proof are given as</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ((T . T))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
since there are no free variables.  Each potential binding for ?WHAT
is part of an independent justification for the fact that there exist
any at all.  ((T . T)) is displayed in the Cyc Browser as "Query was
proven True".</p>
    <p>
In short, all free variables in an ASK have an implicit existential
quantification wrapped around them for purposes of resolving the
ambiguity.  Those variables that are free in the original query are
interpreted as being those for which bindings are requested that
indeed prove the existence of such terms satisfying the query.</p>
    <h3>13.1.2.  <a NAME='137187216'>
ASKing disjunctive queries
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
ASKing disjunctive queries like
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (or
    (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince)
    (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT))
  in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>


<p>
is a request to generate bindings that either satisfy
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
or</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
Now consider a slightly different disjunctive query :
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (or
    (not (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince))
    (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT))
  in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
This is logically equivalent to the query
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince)
    (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT))
  in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
ASKing either of these forms of the query is a request to
return bindings for ?WHAT that satisfy this disjunction.  Note that</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ((?WHAT . EiffelTower))
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
satisfies this disjunction since it is not a Canadian province.
</p>
    <h3>13.1.3.  <a NAME='137214200'>
Conditional Queries (PROVE)</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
It would be more interesting to be able to ask a conditional query in
which ?WHAT is universally quantified, rather than existentially
quantified, as in :</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ;; Is every Canadian province a political subdivision of Canada?
  (forAll ?WHAT
    (implies
      (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince)
      (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)))
 in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
PROVE is a mechanism designed to provide support for this kind of
conditional query.  It accepts formulas of the exact syntactic form</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies &lt;ANTECEDENT> &lt;CONSEQUENT>)
  in &lt;MT></pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Any &lt;SENTENCE> not of this exact syntactic form is treated as if
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies True &lt;SENTENCE>)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
were provided.
</p>
    <p>
Unlike ASK, the free variables of the antecedent (if any) are
assumed <em>universally</em> quantified for the entire query.  The remaining
free variables of the consequent (if any) are then assumed
<em>existentially</em> quantified around that.</p>
    <p>
In order to prove the universal quantifications, PROVE creates a
hypothetical microtheory (the "hypothesis mt") and hypothetical terms
for each of the free variables of the antecedent, and assumes the
antecedent is true of the hypothetical terms in the hypothesis mt.
The hypothesis mt has the query &lt;MT> of the PROVE as its sole
genlMt.  The hypothesis microtheory therefore represents a possible world in
which the antecedent condition is assumed true of generic terms.</p>
    <p>
We then create another hypothetical microtheory (the "proof mt") for
the further type constraints on the generic terms which are imposed by
the consequent within the possible world of the antecedent being true.
The proof microtheory therefore represents a possible world in which the
antecedent and the type constraints from the consequent are assumed
true of generic terms.</p>
    <p>
Within the possible world of the proof microtheory, we then perform an ASK
of the consequent with the generic terms substituted for the free
variables appearing in the antecedent.  If any proof can then be
found, by the rule of universal generalization, it is a proof of the
universals since they were arbitrarily chosen.</p>
    <p>
In short, PROVE creates </p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
two nested possible worlds, one that assumes the antecedent and

one that assumes the antecedent plus additional type constraints from
the consequent</li>
        <li>
generic terms for free variables in the antecedent which satisfy
the antecedent in these possible worlds</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
It then does a normal ASK in these possible worlds, where an answer
would prove a logically equivalent universal result in the query
context.</p>
    <h3>13.1.4.  <a NAME='137252408'>
The Cyc Browser's QUERY tool</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The Cyc Browser's QUERY tool (labeled "Ask" or "Ask A Query") is a
wrapper around both ASK and PROVE.  Any query of the syntactic form</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies &lt;antecedent> &lt;consequent>)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is passed off to PROVE, since that is usually what is intended.
All other queries are passed to ASK.</p>
    <h3>13.1.5.  <a NAME='137262192'>
Tautologies and Contradictions in ASK
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
In ASK, certain logical tautologies like</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (or 
    (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)
    (not (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
can be detected automatically by the canonicalizer, which reduces them
to #$True.  In this case, no inference is performed and</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ((T . T)) 
  :TAUTOLOGY</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is returned by ASK, indicating that the query was logically a
tautology.  In the Cyc Browser, this displays as "Query reduced to
True (a tautology)."  Similarly, a logical contradiction like</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (and
    (geopoliticalSubdivision #$Canada ?WHAT)
    (not (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)))</pre></tt>
    </font>
 
<p>
can be detected and reduced to #$False by the canonicalizer.  In this
case, no inference is performed and </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  NIL
  :CONTRADICTION</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is returned.  This displays as "Query reduced to False (a
contradiction).".</p>
    <h3>13.1.6.  <a NAME='137280392'>
Tautologies and Contradictions in PROVE
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Since PROVE accepts formulas of the form
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies &lt;ANTECEDENT> &lt;CONSEQUENT>)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
if the &lt;ANTECEDENT> ever reduced to #$False, the entire proof would
reduce to #$True.  Therefore, if the antecedent is unsatisfiable in
the possible world of the hypothesis mt, PROVE returns</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ((T . T))
  :TAUTOLOGY</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
If the additional constraints of the consequent are unsatisfiable in
the possible world of the proof mt, PROVE likewise returns</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ((T . T))
  :TAUTOLOGY</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Finally, since the consequent formula is passed to ASK in the proof
mt, if it reduces to #$True or #$False there, PROVE returns either</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <font color='#339900'>
            <tt><pre>
   ((T . T))
  :TAUTOLOGY</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </li>

<li>
          <font color='#339900'>
            <tt><pre>
   NIL
   :CONTRADICTION</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
 


<h3>13.1.7.  <a NAME='137161744'>
Detailed Example
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Assume we want to ask the following query :
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ;; Is every Canadian province a political subdivision of Canada?
  (forAll ?WHAT
    (implies
      (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince)
      (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)))
 in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
We call PROVE with
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince)
    (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada ?WHAT)))
  in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
This causes an instance of #$HypotheticalContext to be created
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (isa #$HYP-Context-001 HypotheticalContext)
  (genlMt HYP-Context-001 WorldGeographyMt)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
It then creates a hypothetical Canadian province in that world :
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  In Mt : HYP-Context-001
  (isa HYP-Province-001 CanadianProvince)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
We create a proof microtheory:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (isa HYP-Context-002 HypotheticalContext)
  (genlMt HYP-Context-002 HYP-Context-001)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Here we additionally assume
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  In Mt : #$HYP-Context-002
  (isa #$HYP-Province-001 GeopoliticalEntity)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
We then do an ASK of
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (geopoliticalSubdivision Canada HYP-Province-001)
  in #$HYP-Context-002</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
If this can be proven of our generic province in this possible world,
it can be proven of every province in WorldGeographyMt.</p>
    <h3>13.1.8.  <a NAME='137335600'>
Caching of hypothesis microtheories
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The advantage of separating the hypothesis mt from the query mt is
clear; it allows us to reason about a possible world without modifying
the context on which that world is based.</p>
    <p>
The advantage of separating the hypothesis mt from the proof mt is
that several different proofs that assume the same possible world can
reuse that world for different proofs.</p>
    <p>
For example, using PROVE on</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ;; Every Canadian province is a political subdivision of what country?
  (implies
    (isa ?WHAT CanadianProvince)
    (and
      (isa ?COUNTRY Country)
      (geopoliticalSubdivision ?COUNTRY ?WHAT)))
  in #$WorldGeographyMt</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
assuming we already did the earlier proof, we can reuse the possible world
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  #$HYP-Context-001
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
since this query uses the same assumed antecedent.  We then only have
to create a different proof mt, in which we ASK</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (and
    (isa ?COUNTRY Country)
    (geopoliticalSubdivision ?COUNTRY HYP-Province-001))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
  in <em><tt>
#$HYP-Context-003</tt></em>
    </p>
    <p>
in which we should be able to return</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ((?COUNTRY . Canada))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
as a binding.</p>
    <p>
Currently, we do not reuse proof mts, although this extension would be
a natural one to make.</p>
    <h3>13.1.9.  <a NAME='137364056'>
Ephemerality of possible worlds and hypothesized terms
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
All the terms hypothesised by PROVE, including
</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
  hypothesis mts</li>
        <li>
  proof mts</li>
        <li>
  generic terms</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
are all marked as #$ephemeralTerm, indicating that they are internal
to this particular Cyc image.  Furthermore we use #$termDependsOn and
#$definingMt to indicate the mutual dependence of these terms on the
hypothesis mt and the original query mt.  Therefore, if the original
query mt were killed, all these hypothesized terms would automatically
be killed as well.</p>
    <h3>13.1.10.  <a NAME='137377488'>
More on type constraints 
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The assumption in the proof mt of the additional constraints from the
consequent makes PROVE's interpretation of type-constraints
identical to that of the inference engine's in regard to the
application of rules.</p>
    <p>
Thus, if the assert</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ASSERT (implies P(x) Q(x)) 
  in MT</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is accepted by the system, asking afterward</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  PROVE  (implies P(x) Q(x))
  in MT, backchain = 1</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
should now always succeed, even if the type constraints on x due to Q(x)
are stronger than those due to P(x).</p>
    <h3>13.1.11.  <a NAME='137387920'>
Antecedent syntactic restrictions in PROVE
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The antecedent of an PROVE has additional syntactic restrictions.
Since it specifies a formula which is intended to be made true in a
possible world, the creation of generic terms for the free variables
is much like the creation of new concepts followed by the asserting
sentences about those concepts.</p>
    <p>
Because we want to reject possible worlds in which the antecedent is
unsatisfiable, or leads to contradictions, we want to use something
like WFF constraints to reject as unsatisfiable an antecedent like</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (and
    (isa ?CAR Automobile)
    (feelsEmotion ?CAR Happiness Positive))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
since it is nonsensical for a car to be the arg1 of a feelsEmotion
assertion.  However, just using the same WFF constraints that we use
during an assert could lead to problems in this case:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (and
    (isa ?MOM AdultPerson)
    (mother Napoleon ?MOM))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
In this case, the mother literal imposes a #$FemalePerson constraint
which is orthogonal to the #$AdultPerson constraint on ?MOM.  So, we
can't simply create an adult person and assert the #$mother literal
because the ?MOM would not yet be known to be a #$FemalePerson.</p>
    <p>
Instead, we analyze the entire antecedent to gather all the type
constraints, both #$isa and #$genls, on the free variables and first
assert all of these.  If this succeeds, we then try asserting all the
remaining assumptions, in order listed in the antecedent.</p>
    <h2>13.2.  <a NAME='137402568'>
Using thereExists To Eliminate Unwanted Variables</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
If you are asking a query in Cyc, it will give you bindings for every
free variable in the query. If you don't care about bindings for a
particular variable, you can existentially quantify that variable so
the system won't return bindings for it.</p>
    <p>
Example: Say that we wanted to ask Cyc for all the redheaded men
with children. If we ask</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$and 
   (#$isa ?MAN #$AdultMalePerson) 
   (#$hairColor ?MAN #$Scalp #$RedColor) 
   (#$children ?MAN ?KID))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<p>
Then we will get back bindings for both variables, ?MAN and ?KID.
But if we really only want to know about the redheaded men with children,
and don't care about their children, then we could ask this instead:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$thereExists ??KID 
  (#$and 
   (#$isa ?MAN #$AdultMalePerson) 
   (#$hairColor ?MAN #$Scalp #$RedColor) 
   (#$children ?MAN ??KID)))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<p>
By wrapping a #$thereExists ?KID around the query, Cyc will now know that
you only care about the existence of bindings for that variable and that
you don't care about the bindings themselves. Note the ?? prefix on ??KID.
This is a convention that indicates the variable is a "don't care" variable.
It is not currently (August 2001) used by Cyc except for certain diagnostic
utilities.</p>
    <h2>13.3.  <a NAME='137423216'>
Using assertedSentence etc. To Block Unwanted Inheritance</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
The transitivity support in the inference engine is very powerful,
but sometimes you are looking only for things that have been explicitly
asserted, not those which can be inferred.  There are some HL-supported
predicates you can use to specify this.  They are:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
#$assertedSentence</li>
        <li>
#$ist-Asserted</li>
        <li>
#$assertedPredicateArg</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>13.3.1.  <a NAME='137452400'>
#$assertedSentence
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Here is an example of a case where #$assertedSentence comes in handy.
</p>
    <p>
Imagine that you wanted to find all of the binary relations in the KB that
could take an instance of #$Missile in one or more argument positions.
You might try the query</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (thereExists ??N
    (thereExists ?WHAT
      (and
        (isa ?RELN BinaryPredicate)
        (argIsa ?RELN ??N ?WHAT)
        (genls Missile ?WHAT))))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<em><p>
[also see the section "Using thereExists To Eliminate Unwanted Variables" in this chapter]</p></em>
    <p>
You might be surprised to see that many of the predicates returned
from this query would be such that neither of the argIsas was a
generalization of #$Missile, e.g. #$lockState, which relates an instance
of #$Lock to an instance of #$LockStateAttribute.</p>
    <p>
This is because Cyc believes
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (transitiveViaArg argIsa genls 3)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
Hence, since Cyc knows
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (argIsa lockState 1 Lock)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
it can conclude from the above two assertions:
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (argIsa lockState 1 PartiallyTangible)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
and since #$PartiallyTangible is a genls of #$Missile, back comes
#$lockState in the binding list for ?RELN.</p>
    <p>
This is a case in which you would want to use #$assertedSentence to
block unwanted inheritance.  Instead of the initial query</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (thereExists ??N
    (thereExists ?WHAT
      (and
        (isa ?RELN BinaryPredicate)
        (argIsa ?RELN ??N ?WHAT)
        (genls Missile ?WHAT))))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
the following query will get you the answers you seek:
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (thereExists ??N 
    (thereExists ?WHAT 
      (and 
        (isa ?RELN BinaryPredicate) 
        (assertedSentence 
          (argIsa ?RELN ??N ?WHAT)) 
        (genls Missile ?WHAT))))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
The only obscure case that the above query would not cover is if there
were a predicate which had disjoint arg constraints, one of which was
a spec of #$Missile.  There are diagnostics which should catch this OE
error, but if you wanted to eliminate such relations from coming back
as bindings for ?RELN, you could modify the query thusly:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (thereExists ?N
    (thereExists ?WHAT
      (and
        (isa ?RELN BinaryPredicate)
        (assertedSentence (argIsa ?RELN ?N ?WHAT))
        (unknownSentence
          (thereExists ?OTRWHAT
            (and
              (argIsa ?RELN ?N ?OTRWHAT)
              (disjointWith ?OTRWHAT Missile))))
        (genls Missile ?WHAT))))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Another predicate related to #$assertedSentence is #$assertionSentence.  It is 
related in the following way:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$assertedSentence :SENTENCE)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is equivalent to
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$thereExists ?ASSERTION
    (#$assertionSentence ?ASSERTION :SENTENCE))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<h3>13.3.2.  <a NAME='137498480'>
#$assertedPredicateArg
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Say that you wanted to see whether there was a #$capitalCity assertion
for the United States.  You don't want to know whether Cyc can infer
the United States' capital city, and you don't care what it is; you
just want to know whether there is currently an actual assertion of
the form (#$capitalCity #$UnitedStatesOfAmerica &lt;whatever>).  To ask
this query you can use #$assertedPredicateArg as follows:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$assertedPredicateArg #$UnitedStatesOfAmerica 1 #$capitalCity)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
We could have also asked
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$thereExists ?CITY
    (#$assertedSentence
      (#$capitalCity #$UnitedStatesOfAmerica ?CITY)))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
to get the same result.
</p>
    <p>
Hence, #$assertedPredicateArg is just shorthand for a common case of
#$assertedSentence; wrapping a bunch of existentials around the
arguments you don't care about, and saving you from worrying about the
arity of the predicate.  It's most useful when you don't know the
predicate or the argument number at query construction time, because
it would be nigh impossible to write a terse query to achieve the
effect of #$assertedPredicateArg.</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$assertedPredicateArg :TERM 1 :PRED)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
is equivalent to
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$thereExists ?REST-ARGS
    (#$assertedSentence
      (:PRED :TERM . ?REST-ARGS)))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
and similarly,</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$assertedPredicateArg :TERM 2 :PRED)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
is equivalent to
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$thereExists ?ARG-1
    (#$thereExists ?REST-ARGS
      (#$assertedSentence
        (:PRED ?ARG-1 :TERM . ?REST-ARGS))))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
etc.</p>
    <h3>13.3.3.  <a NAME='137525664'>
#$ist-Asserted
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
#$ist-Asserted is like a version of #$assertedSentence which gives you
control over the microtheory assumptions.
</p>
    <p>
This is most useful when you don't know the microtheory at query
construction time.  It's good for reasoning in one context about
whether something's asserted in another context.</p>
    <p>
Say you want to find all the specs of #$Fruit in the #$BiologyMt
which do not have a #$denotation assertion in the #$EnglishMt.
Then you could ask a query in the #$BiologyMt like so:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (and
    (knownSentence
      (genls ?FRUIT Fruit))
    (ist-Asserted GeneralEnglishMt
      (denotation ??WORD ??POS ??SENSE ?FRUIT)))

  (#$ist-Asserted :MT :SENTENCE)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is equivalent to</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$thereExists ?ASSERTION
    (#$thereExists ?GENL-MT
      (#$and
