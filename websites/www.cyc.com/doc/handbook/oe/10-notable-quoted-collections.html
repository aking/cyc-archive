    <h3>10.1.1.  <a NAME='137149904'>
Background</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
As the reader is probably aware, the Cyc Knowledge Base (KB) has been
sectioned according to whether its various components are considered
suitable for released.  A large section of the knowledge
base, constituting much of the Cyc upper-ontology as well as some middle-
and lower-ontology, is presently in the
public domain.  This part of the Knowledge Base, often referred to
in-house as the "public release", is available to anyone.</p>
    <p>
An even larger section of the Knowledge Base, subsuming the public
release and containing a good deal more, has been sanctioned for
release to corporations and individuals who are co-participants with
Cyc in various DARPA contracts, and covered by the relevant
non-disclosure agreements associated with those contracts.  This
portion of the Knowledge Base is generally referred to as the
Integrated Knowledge Base or IKB.  Like the full KB, it is subject to
scheduled updates and rebuilds.</p>
    <p>
Finally, a small portion of the Knowledge Base, disjoint with the IKB,
is considered Cycorp-proprietary information that should not be
released to anyone outside the company.  Sometimes, this is because
the information is pertinent to commercial contracts that are subject
to non-disclosure; sometimes, it is because the terms in question are
considered experimental in one way or another, and therefore not
suitable for immediate release.</p>
    <p>
Historically, the aforementioned sectioning of the Knowledge Base has
been enforced with what amounts to a data-tagging system using
#$isa.  These data tags effectively determine what constants are
included (or not included) in which release.  The relevant collection
type is #$CycKBSubsetCollection.
</p>
    <h3>10.1.2.  <a NAME='136574312'>
CycKBSubsetCollection</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
#$CycKBSubsetCollection is the collection of all collections that are
used for tagging constants w.r.t. client related roles, e.g., whether
or not they should appear in a certain release.  Some key things to
notice about this constant are that it is itself an instance of
ProprietaryConstant (a #$CycKBSubsetCollection) because we don't want
our scheme for organizing constants relative to release to be in the
public domain.  It's also the case (supported by forward rules) that
every collection that is an instance of #$CycKBSubsetCollection has the
wrappers quotedCollection and completeCollectionExtent.  I.e.,
instances of #$CycKBSubsetCollection are assumed to be 'de re' collections of
denoting CycL terms and not collections of the things CycL terms
denote, and Cyc at any given time will assume that the extent of any
#$CycKBSubsetCollection is circumscribed; i.e., if a term is not known
to be a member of the collection, this will be taken as justification
for concluding that the term is not a member of the
collection.</p>
    <p>
The most salient feature of #$CycKBSubsetCollection, however, is
the expressed by the assertion:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
    (interArgIsa2-1 genls CycKBSubsetCollection CycKBSubsetCollection)
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
What this says, effectively, is that any specialization of an instance
of #$CycKBSubsetCollection must itself be known to be an instance of
#$CycKBSubsetCollection.  The reason for this is simple:  we don't want
Cyc collections that somebody might easily be using for another
purpose, completely orthogonal to the issue of whether a constant should
be released or not, to be made a specialization of a collection that determines
whether or not a constant is released.  For example, suppose this
constraint were not enforced, and a well-intentioned individual
decided to make the collection #$MilitaryUnitSpecialtyType a spec of 
#$IKBConstant.  This would mean that every newly-minted instance of
#$MilitaryUnitSpecialtyType would automatically be included in the IKB,
without anybody ever having to assert it explicitly.  This might seem
like a good idea, but there are two things wrong with it.  First, and
most fundamentally, we can't foresee all of the future circumstances in
which it might be necessary to create instances of
#$MilitaryUnitSpecialtyType.  If, at some future date, a Cyclist working
on a company-proprietary project needed to create an instance, and the
collection were a spec of #$IKBConstant, this person would be presented
with a conflict of interest.  Worse still, it's conceivable that
someone, especially a novice, could overlook the link to #$IKBConstant,
or fail to realize its significance.  Thus, allowing non-KB subset
collections to be specs of KB subset collections could lead to
constants inadvertantly getting released.  The interArgIsa2-1
stricture is designed to foreclose on that by insuring that a
constant can only be designated for release by an explicit act of
tagging with a release-oriented #$CycKBSubsetCollection.
</p>
    <h3>10.1.3.  <a NAME='137181168'>
Important Release Constants
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Here are some of the more important instances of
#$CycKBSubsetCollection.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <em>
#$CoreConstant</em>
        </dt>
        <dd>
This is the collection of all constants that are
required to be defined in order for implementations of Cyc to run.

specialization of #$PublicConstant.</dd>
        <dt>
          <em>
#$PublicConstant</em>
        </dt>
        <dd>
This is the collection of all constants included
in the current public release of Cyc:  i.e., all Cyc constants that
are presently in the public domain.  Special procedures attach to
killing and renaming these constants, since they may be being used in
the public sector without our direct knowledge.</dd>
        <dt>
          <em>
#$CycorpProprietaryConstant</em>
        </dt>
        <dd>
The collection of all Cyc constants that
are considered to be Cycorp-proprietary for whatever reason.  They
should not be included in any public Cyc release.  It is a spec of the
non-KB subset collection #$ProprietaryConstant, which is disjoint with #$IKBConstant.</dd>
        <dt>
          <em>

        <dd>
The collection of all Cyc constants that are
regularly included in IKB updates and builds.</dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
A quick perusal of the #$CycKBSubsetCollections will reveal that
#$IKBConstant has itself been subdivided according to government
project, and that several of these subdivisions have in turn been 
subdivided according to project phase (one of the main reasons we 
consider this tagging system proprietary:  someone with access to it 
and to the creation dates of the constants involved could readily 
reconstruct the company's project history).</p>Some important active specs of #$IKBConstant are

    <h3>10.1.4.  <a NAME='137222640'>
Authoring Release Constants and Tagging Constants for Release</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
It is the responsibility of project leaders to make sure that all of
the necessary #$CycKBSubsetCollections relevant to the project are
created.  They can either do this themselves, or delegate
responsibility to the project OE lead.  If you are not a project
manager, and you think that a project-related #$CycKBSubsetCollection
should be created, the project manager is the first person that you
should consult. </p>
    <p>
As a rule, the question of which constants are tagged for release is
determined by the needs and requirements of a specific project.  E.g.,
if you are working on any of the Cycorp's extant DARPA contracts, it
is very likely that any constants you create should be tagged as
IKBConstants, if not as specializations thereof.  Again, it is
primarily the responsibility of the project manager, and secondarily
that of the OE lead, to make sure that all project members know what
needs to be tagged, and how.  If there are any questions about whether
or not a constant should be released, these concerns should be taken
to the OE lead and project manager ASAP:  often, though not always,
such questions prove to be an issue for upper management.
</p>
    <h3>10.1.5.  <a NAME='137231648'>
A Word on IKB Troubleshooting
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The IKB build is probably the most complex KB update-and-rebuild
operation currently undertaken at Cycorp.  Essentially it involves
taking a slice of a continuously-revised Knowledge Base, and running a
series of cleanup operations to insure that there are no seams showing
from the numerous editings that occur when the IKB is extracted.  It
cannot be emphasized enough to those working on IKB related
projects:</p>
    <font color='red' size='-1'>
      <em>
The (isa ?X IKBConstant) tag determines, and is the only
thing that determines, what does or doesn't get included in the IKB.
If you want a constant you are creating to be included in the IKB, it
must be tagged in this way, using either IKBConstant itself, or
a #$CycKBSubsetCollection that is a known spec of
IKBConstant.</em>
    </font>
    <p>
The implications of this should be borne in mind:  in particular,
there are two that are critical.  First, if a constant is an
IKBConstant, but some term that is referenced in a key piece of its
definitional info (isa or genls, say, in the case of a collection)
isn't, then it will go into the IKB missing that piece of definitional
info.  Therefore, you need to make sure that all of the terms needed
to define your constant are also IKBConstants.  I emphasize this
particularly because it is the single biggest source of questions
concerning whether or not a constant should be released.  If questions
of this nature arise, consult your project manager.</p>
    <p>
The other key point to bear in mind is that the microtheory in which
an IKBConstant is defined must also be an IKBConstant; otherwise the
term itself will go in, but with most of its assertions lost because
they don't have an mt-of-assertion in the IKB.  Again, if this fact
gives rise to questions about what should or shouldn't be released,
you should consult your project manager.</p>
    <h2>10.2.  <a NAME='137242944'>
Public Constants</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
#$PublicConstant is the collection of CycL constants that 
are included in the part of the Cyc ontology that is 
released to the public.  Many of constants in the so-called 
upper-ontology -- which comprises the most general concepts
represented in Cyc -- are public constants.  middle- and 
lower-ontology constants can be public as well, if deemed
appropriate for public consumption.  While all constants in 
the Cyc Knowledge Base should in principle be well-defined,
nicely-commented, and adequately axiomatized, these virtues
are particularly important in the case of public constants.
Let's briefly consider each of these three virtues in turn.</p>
    <p>
A constant CONST is well-defined, in the present sense, 
when the "definitional" assertions on it are accurate 
(given the intended meaning CONST) and complete.  The 
definitional assertions on CONST include (but are not 
limited to) most of those displayed when one brings up CONST
in the KB Browser and selects the "Definitional Info" option 
in the Index.  Thus included are atomic assertions in which 
CONST is the first argument (arg1) to a #$DefinitionalPredicate 
(or, in some cases, a #$SometimesDefinitionalPredicate or a 
strictly #$PossibleDefinitionalPredicate), such as #$isa, #$genls, 
#$arg1Isa, #$arg2Genl, #$arg3Format, #$genlPreds, #$genlInverse, 
#$negationPreds,#$negationInverse, #$interArgIsa1-2, 
#$disjointWith, #$collectionIntersection, or #$salientAssertions.</p>
    <p>
A good comment on a constant is clear, accurate, and as precise 
as it reasonably can be.  It should include -- as appropriate -- 
examples, qualifications, borderline cases, exceptions, and so 
on.  It should be grammatically perfect, and free of undefined 
acronyms with which the average non-Cyclist user cannot safely be 
assumed to be familiar.</p>
    <p>
A constant is adequately axiomatized for present purposes when, 
at a minimum, the content of its comment is completely represented
in rules or other assertions.  Ideally, all of these comment-explicating
assertions should consist entirely of public constants, as assertions that
contain any non-public constants will not be part of the public
release.  Also, ideally it should not contain any instances of #$ProprietaryConstant, 
as no #$ProprietyaryConstant can be a release constant of any kind. 
Axioms that are of central importance to the meaning of a constant and would not
otherwise appear in the Arg1 index for the constant in the KB Browser, should be made 
its #$salientAssertions.</p>

    <h3>10.4.1.  <a NAME='137263448'>
The Meaning and Use of These Predicates</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The predicates #$quotedCollection and #$quotedArgument are used 
in certain situations where one wants to use CycL to assert 
something about a CycL expression itself, or about a class of CycL 
expressions.  Cyclists have found it useful to reify various 
collections whose instances are CycL expressions, and various 
predicates that relate CycL expressions to things of one sort or 
another.  Such collections and predicates enable us to represent 
(and make inferences with) many key facts about the CycL language 
and the Cyc system as assertions in the Knowledge Base, rather 
than consigning them strictly to separate company documentation 
(which tends to become stale) and the minds of Cyclists (who can 
forget, misremember, or fail to understand things).  For example, 
we have the quoted-collection #$PublicConstant, which is the 
collection of all the CycL constants included in the part of the 
Knowledge Base released to the public; and we have the predicate 
#$myCreator, which has a quoted-argument-place, and relates 
a given CycL constant to the Cyclist who created it.
</p>
    <p>
A potential stumbling-block to the effective use of these kinds of
collections and predicates it that there is currently no general 
mechanism in place for denoting particular CycL expressions within 
the CycL language itself.  As with any language, to use a given
CycL term is, usually, to refer to the term's (usual) denotation.
But what if one wants to refer to <em>the term itself</em>?  In natural 
languages like ordinary written English, of course, one can employ 
quotation marks (or italics) for this purpose: by enclosing an
English word or phrase within a pair of quotes (or italicizing it) 
we indicate our intention to refer to that word or phrase itself
(as opposed to whatever the word/phrase might normally denote or 
represent).  There is nothing in CycL, however, analogous to direct
quotation.  (This is the case with most formal languages.)  Hence, 
there is no direct way to say, in CycL, that a particular CycL 
expression is an instance of a given collection, or that a given 
predicate holds of the expression.  #$quotedCollection and 
#$quotedArgument, however, enable us to make such assertions, 
albeit in an <em>indirect</em> way.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <em>
#$quotedCollection</em>
        </dt>
        <dd>
A unary predicate that can take any instance
of #$Collection as argument.  (#$quotedCollection COLLECTION) means<blockquote>
            <ol>
              <li>
the instances of COLLECTION are CycL expressions and</li>
              <li>
an
#$isa statement in which COLLECTION appears as the second argument 
(or "arg2") -- i.e. a CycL sentence of the form (#$isa TERM COLLECTION)
-- means that the CycL term TERM itself (as opposed to what TERM
denotes) is an instance of COLLECTION.</li>
            </ol>
          </blockquote>  Thus, 
(#$isa #$IndianOcean #$PublicConstant) means that the CycL constant 
'#$IndianOcean' is an instance of the collection #$PublicConstant;
it does not mean the Indian Ocean (which is an ocean and not a constant)
is a public constant.
</dd>
        <dt>
          <em>
#$quotedArgument</em>
        </dt>
        <dd>
A binary predicate that takes a #$Relation (such as 
a #$Predicate or #$Function-Denotational) and a #$PositiveInteger as 
arguments.  (#$quotedArgument RELATION N) means that RELATION's Nth 
argument-place is quoted.  That is, a ground atomic formula (or GAF) 
built from RELATION and having a CycL term TERM in its Nth argument-place 
means that TERM itself (as opposed to what TERM denotes) stands in 
RELATION with the rest of the GAF's arguments.  Thus, 
(#$myCreator #$Thing #$Lenat) means that the CycL constant '#$Thing'
was reified by Doug Lenat; it does not mean that Lenat created the
collection of all things.</dd>
      </dl>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>10.4.2.  <a NAME='137291160'>
Some Consequences and Complications
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
A notable consequence of the meaning of #$quotedCollection as described 
above is that a GAF based on #$isa that has a quoted-collection as its 
second argument is interpreted somewhat differently than a similar GAF 
having a non-quoted-collection in that position.  Further, since #$genls 
derives its meaning (via its rule macro expansion) from #$isa, #$genls 
statements involving quoted-collections also mean something slightly 
different than they otherwise do.  This is especially true when one of 
the collections is quoted and the other is not.  Suppose QUOTED-COL is a 
quoted-collection and NON-QUOTED-COL is a collection that is not quoted.  
Then (#$genls QUOTED-COL NON-QUOTED-COL) means that if a CycL term TERM 
is an instance of QUOTED-COL, then (not TERM itself, but) the thing 
denoted by TERM is an instance of NON-QUOTED-COL.  
(#$genls #$CycLExpression #$Thing) is an example such an assertion 
in the Knowledge Base.  (A sentence of the form 
(#$genls NON-QUOTED-COL QUOTED-COL), though rarely asserted in the
Knowledge Base, means that if a thing THING is an instance of 
NON-QUOTED-COL then any CycL term that denotes THING is an instance 
of QUOTED-COL.)</p>
    <p>
Similarly, certain #$genlPreds statements involving predicates with 
quoted argument-places have somewhat skewed meanings.  Suppose QUOTED-PRED 
is a predicate whose Nth argument-place (only) is quoted and
NON-QUOTED-PRED 
is a predicate with no quoted argument-places.  Then 
(#$genlPreds QUOTED-PRED NON-QUOTED-PRED) means that if QUOTED-PRED holds
of a 
given sequence SEQ of argument-values, then NON-QUOTED-PRED holds (not of 
SEQ itself, but) of the sequence obtained by replacing the Nth item in SEQ 
(which will be some CycL term) with what it denotes.  If QUOTED-PRED has 
multiple quoted argument-places a completely analogous, though more 
complicated, replacement is required.  (#$genlPreds #$equalSymbols
#$equals) 
is an example of such an assertion in the Knowledge Base. </p>
    <p>
It should be noted that the sorts of meaning-shifts associated with
#$quotedCollection and #$quotedArgument described above raise certain 
difficulties for the interpretation of CycL, only some of which can be
explained here.  Consider the facts, described above, that the meaning 
of a sentence of the form (#$isa X COLLECTION) varies depending on 
whether or not COLLECTION is quoted, and that of (PRED ARG1...ARGN) 
varies depending on whether any of PRED's argument-places are quoted.  
The question arises as to how to reconcile these shifts in
sentence-meaning
with the intended meanings of such sentences' constituent expressions.  
Let us define a <em>quoted-occurrence</em> of a CycL term TERM as any occurrence 
of TERM as either (i) the arg1 of an #$isa sentence whose arg2 is a 
quoted-collection or (ii) the argN of a sentence built with a predicate
whose Nth argument-place is quoted.  A simple and initially attractive 
account would be to say that quoted-occurrences of TERM denote TERM itself 
(as opposed to whatever TERM normally denotes).  Thus, 
(#$isa #$IndianOcean #$PublicConstant) means what it does (see above) 
precisely because '#$IndianOcean' denotes itself (the term
'#$IndianOcean') 
in that context, while the other constituents of the sentence -- in 
particular '#$isa' -- mean exactly the same thing they do in any other 
context.  And the same account serves equally well in explaining the 
meanings of sentences built from predicates with quoted argument-places.
On this approach, the source of such sentences' skewed meaning is traced 
soley to a meaning-shift associated with quoted-occurrences of terms.</p>
    <p>
But this approach, while providing a reasonable account of GAFs containing 
quoted-occurrences of terms, falters in the case of rules.  In a rule, 
a single bound variable can occupy both "quoted" and "non-quoted"
positions 
simultaneously.  Take the above #$genls example and consider its
rule-macro 
expansion:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (#$implies
    (#$isa ?VAR QUOTED-COL)
    (#$isa ?VAR NON-QUOTED-COL).</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
The second, non-quoted occurrence of '?VAR' in this rule is ordinary 
and unproblematic.  But what about the first, "quoted" occurrence?  
If we extend the present approach to include variables, and say that 
as a quoted-occurrence it <em>denotes itself</em>, it follows that this 
occurrence of '?VAR' is functioning as a <em>constant</em> (that denotes a 
certain CycL variable) instead of as a genuine variable, and that, 
consequently, the rule says something very different from what it is 
intended to.  Conversely, if we refuse to extend our approach to 
variables, and view both occurrences of '?VAR' as genuine occurrences 
of the same variable, the rule still would not say what it was intended 
to, but rather the (quite possibly false) claim that any instance of 
the quoted-collection QUOTED-COL (i.e. some CycL term) is an instance 
of the non-quoted collection NON-QUOTED-COL.</p>
    <p>
An alternate approach, which traced the meaning-shifts associated
with #$isa sentences to a systematic ambiguity in the meaning of
the predicate '#$isa' itself (instead of to the term occupying its
first argument-place) might avoid this difficulty with rules and 
variables.  But that approach would raise new difficulties of its 
own, one being that it seems incapable of being extended to a 
plausible account of the meaning-shifts involving #$genlPreds
sentences.  (Space limitations prevent a more thorough pursual of 
this alternate approach here.)</p>
    <p>
A more radical alternative -- which would obviate the need for 
predicates like #$quotedCollection and #$quotedArgument and the 
meaning-shifts they entail -- would be to introduce a general method 
into the CycL language such that, given any CycL term TERM, another 
term can be found or constructed that unambiguously denotes TERM.
Such an alternative would amount to having something like direct
quotation in CycL.  It has been suggested that this could be done via 
the introduction of a "quotation function" on CycL expressions, but 
that is a dubious proposal.  For there is not and cannot be a 
general <em>function</em> from things to their names, even if the named 
things are restricted to being linguistic expressions themselves, 
due to the simple fact that a single thing can have multiple names 
(Cyc's so-called unique name assumption notwithstanding).  A more 
promising approach along the same lines would be to introduce a new
class of special CycL terms expressly intended to denote other CycL
terms, and then assign the former terms their denotations by some
rules or principles stated in the meta-language of CycL instead of
trying to do this via a function defined in CycL itself.  Perhaps 
these special terms should (or must) <em>themselves</em> be precluded from 
being denoted by CycL terms, but that would seem to be a minor
limitation.  Implementing this latter approach, however, would 
require giving a considerably more explicit description of the 
meta-language of CycL than has hitherto been done.</p>
