Index Overlap
</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
With this tool it is possible to find all assertions in which all the requested 
terms are terms in the assertion. </p>
    <p>
The Index Overlap tool is found on the Tools page of the Cyc Browser, in the second 
column of tools:</p>
    <pre>
                     Overlap Term     Index Overlap
</pre>
<p>
It is possible to add this, or any Cyc Browser tool to your Cyc Browser's toolbar by 
depressing the button to the left of the tool option and then clicking "Update Toolbar" 
at the top of the tools page.  (Please see the chapter titled "Using the KB Browser" for 
more information).</p>
    <p>
Once the "Overlap" tool is opened, a screen with a large white entry box is displayed. 
When two or more Cyc constants are entered (with or without the #$ prefix), the tool
will return all the CycL assertions that contain all those terms. If I'm looking for 
all the CycL assertions that contain the terms #$evokes and
#$Cuteness-EmotionalResponse, I would enter those terms (with or without the #$, 
although asking Cyc to Cyclify the terms would reveal whether I had entered all the
terms correctly) in the white box and click on "Search".</p>
    <p>
The Index Overlap tool would return the following assertions:

<h2>12.3.  <a NAME='137178216'>
Similarity Tool</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>12.3.1.  <a NAME='137180952'>
Introduction</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The Similarity Tool is designed to provide a more visual comparison of the definitions 
of CycL constants. In other words, it shows a minimized set of similarities and 
differences between the given constants' #$isa and #$genls assertions. Currently 
only #$isa and #$genls and thier specPreds are supported, but this could be extended 
if needed.</p>
    <p>
Since the tool attempts to compress much information in a single browser pane, it can be
confusing to read. Provided here will be a short walkthrough to compare the two 
constants #$Cat and #$Dog.</p>
    <p>
To function the tool must be given at least two constants to compare, but an 
indefinite number can be compared together. Of course, the comparison can become 
difficult to read if too many constants are compared at the same time.</p>
    <h3>12.3.2.  <a NAME='137188584'>
Walkthrough</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Instead of making the user type in a list of constants to compare, the browser history is
leveraged so that the user can choose input constants from their list of browsed 
constants. To view the history, choose "History" from the tools menu. The 
Similarity Tool only allows input from the history, so you must first browse the 
constants you wish to compare.</p>
    <p>
Look at the constants #$Cat and #$Dog to add them to your history.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/handbook/images/figure1-similarity.jpg'></center>
    <p>
Now that the constants are in the history, we can start the Similarity Tool by choosing
"Similarity" from the Tools menu.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/handbook/images/figure2-similarity.jpg'></center>
    <p>
The opening screen will show your constants' history with a checkbox next to each 
constant. Choose at least two input constants to compare, then select 
<nobr>
[Run Similarity Tool].</nobr>
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/handbook/images/figure3-similiarity.jpg'></center>
    <p>
The tool now performs comparisons of the constants and displays a table of 
the results. In this table, there is a column for each input constant, and a row 
for each constant that has a relation with one or more of the input constants. 
In each cell below an input constant and to the left of another constant, a relation 
is shown between the constants. The predicate used is shown in a purple
row and the microtheory in a light blue row. To deconstantine which predicate and 
microtheory are relevant to a cell, simply look for the nearest predicate and 
microtheory above the row the cell is in.</p>
    <p>
If the cell is grey, there is no relation found (asserted or trivially deduced) 
between the constants. If the cell is colored, the relation is one of the ones 
in the following legend.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/handbook/images/figure4-similarity.jpg'></center>
    <p>
The assertion balls indicate assertions made in the KB and clicking one will browse the
relevant assertion. A checked checkbox exists for each assertion that is asserted 
in the KB (as opposed to deduced). A yellow cell indicates that the assertion is 
asserted, but not redundant. A red cell indicates that the assertion is asserted 
but redundant with another asserted assertion. A green cell means that the 
relationship can be deduced from other assertions through the SBHL.</p>
    <p>
Since the checkboxes indicate whether an assertion exists in the KB, this layout 
suggests  that one can check or uncheck boxes to assert or unassert assertions, 
respectively.  This is indeed the case. Simply check the assertions you wish to add or 
unckeck  the ones to remove and click the [Submit] button to add the operations to 
the agenda. If javascript is enabled, small dots will appear to the left of the checkbox
rows allowing quick checking and unchecking of all the checkboxes in a row.</p>
    <p>
To complete the walkthrough, we will go through an explanation of a couple of parts of 
the Similarity Tool results for the input constants #$Cat and #$Dog.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/handbook/images/figure5-similiarity.jpg'></center>
    <p>
In figure 5, we see a comparison of the #$isa assertions for #$Cat and #$Dog. 
Some things to notice include: In #$BaseKB, #$Cat and #$Dog are both inferred to 
be instances of #$Thing and asserted (monotonic) to be instances of 
#$OrganismClassificationType. Also, #$Cat is asserted to be an instance of 
#$IKBConstant, while dog is asserted to be a #$PublicConstant, which
implies memebership in the #$IKBConstant collection. In #$BiologyMt, both are asserted
instances if #$BiologicalSpecies, but #$Dog also has a redundant assertion making it an
instance of #$BiologicalTaxon.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/handbook/images/figure6-similiarity.jpg'></center>
    <p>
In figure 6, we see a comparison of the #$genls assertions for #$Cat and #$Dog. In
particular, we see that there are two asseritions here: </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
   (genls Cat FelidaeFamily)</pre></tt>
    </font> 

<p>
and
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
   (genls Dog CanineAnimal)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
The collection #$FelidaeFamily and #$CanineAnimal intersect at the collections 
#$Carnivore, #$Mammal, and #$NonPersonAnimal, to which a minimal set of
all the collections both #$Dog and #$Cat belong.</p>
    <h2>12.4.  <a NAME='137235208'>
Salient Descriptor</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
The Salient Descriptor is an RKF (Rapid Knowledge Formation) tool,
whose purpose is to present the user with prompts for expected
knowledge about a given term.  It relies on information in the Knowledge
Base (KB) about what knowledge is expected for different types of things.  This
information is expressed via rules concluding to literals whose
predicate is one of</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em><tt>
#$keRequirement</tt></em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><tt>
#$keStrongSuggestion</tt></em>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em><tt>
#$keWeakSuggestion</tt></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
Before the Salient Descriptor was implemented as a full-fledged RKF
tool available via the UIA, there was an initial implementation in the
Cyc Browser, which is available by clicking on the [Salient Describe]
option when browsing a term.  The "Requirements", "Strong
Suggestions", and "Weak Suggestions" checkboxes correspond to the
aforementioned three predicates, respectively.  The "Neighbors"
option is not yet implemented.</p>
    <p>
The intent is that for each suggestion, the user will be prompted to
fill in a value, choose from a list of possible values, or answer a
Yes/No question.  This is correctly implemented in the UIA, but the
version available in the Cyc Browser is a legacy implementation and
does not currently allow the user to make any assertions.  However, it
does allow you to see the conclusions of the inference as to what
knowledge is required, strongly suggested, and weakly suggested.</p>
    <p>
Eventually this tool will have full functionality both in the UIA
and the Cyc Browser.</p>
