What is "skipping the predicate" and why is it bad?
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
"Skipping the predicate" is using a functional (NAT) representation
without any underlying semantic predicate representation.  It's bad
because it (a) restricts inference capability to terms that have a
particular syntactic form, even if the semantics should allow the
inference, (b) forces ontologists to overuse forward rules, and (c) causes
ontologists to write rules that are more complicated than necessary, and thus
have poor representational modularity as well as suboptimal inference
efficiency.</p>
    <p>
NAT functions should almost always be viewed as constructors for
underlying predicate vocabulary.  Therefore, the defining rules for
the NAT should usually be forward, and conclude to the predicate
representation.  Then, other rules (which may be forward or backward
as appropriate) define the predicate representation.</p>
    <p>
When "skipping the predicate" occurs, ontologists write rules going
straight from the NAT representation past any intermediate predicate
representation.  Thus, they almost always have to make their rules
forward in order to conclude correct behavior from a new #$termOfUnit,
even if the final result need not be concluded forward.  Also, they
have to duplicate the NAT quantification in every rule.</p>
    <p>
The reason "skipping the predicate" is easy to do is that #$termOfUnit
can be used as the (very weak) underlying predicate representation.  In
other words, the relationship between a NAT and its args is implicit
in the very representation of the NAT, and rules that quantify into
NATs exploit this syntactic relationship.  </p>
    <p>
Most rules should be defining and depending on semantic relationships
rather than syntactic ones.  Therefore, it is important that the
underlying relationship hinted at syntactically in a NAT be made
semantically explicit.</p>
    <p>
Here's a perfect example from KB history :</p>
    <p>
Originally the NAT function
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  #$SaintFn : #$Person -> #$Saint</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
was created to denote things like</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
    (SaintFn ThomasAquinas)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
However, there was no explicit relationship between </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
    (SaintFn ThomasAquinas)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
and  #$ThomasAquinas defined!  There was only the implicit one that the NAT 
is constructed from two terms, its ARG0 and ARG1.</p>
    <p>
There were some rules defining #$SaintFn, and all of them were more
complicated than necessary because the representation "skipped the
predicate".  One example:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (termOfUnit ?SAINT (SaintFn ?PERSON))
    (startsAfterEndingOf ?SAINT ?PERSON))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
One drawback of this representation is that if we reified
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  #$SaintThomasAquinas
</pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
we would have no way to conclude that he starts after the ending
of #$ThomasAquinas, because the CycL term #$SaintThomasAquinas
does not match the syntactic pattern (SaintFn ?PERSON) in the
faulty rule.</p>
    <p>
Clearly, there is a deeper semantic relationship between Thomas
Aquinas and St. Thomas Aquinas rather than "arg 1 of NAT":</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  #$saintlyIncarnation : #$Person x #$Saint</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
With this, the only forward defining rule needed for #$SaintFn is:
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (termOfUnit ?SAINT (SaintFn ?PERSON))
    (saintlyIncarnation ?PERSON ?SAINT))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
or, equivalently and more simply:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (saintlyIncarnation ?PERSON (SaintFn ?PERSON))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Now, the rules defining #$SaintFn are used to define #$saintlyIncarnation
instead, in much simpler and efficient form.  For example, we can now
unassert</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (termOfUnit ?SAINT (SaintFn ?PERSON))
    (startsAfterEndingOf ?SAINT ?PERSON))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
and replace it with</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (genlInverse saintlyIncarnation startsAfterEndingOf).</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Reifiable functions should be considered constructors of objects which
participate in relationships.  In almost every case, there should be
an underlying predicate for which the function is defining uniform
uses.  The underlying relationship that #$SaintFn was implicitly
defining was</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  "relation between a person and the associated saint of that person"</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
That relation is at least as important as #$SaintFn, and deserves to be
semantically explicit rather than syntactic and implicitly hidden
inside #$termOfUnit.</p>
    <p>
The arguments to any NAT should always have some underlying predicate
relationship to the NAT itself.  In the case of a high-arity NAT,
there may be many predicates being skipped, not just one.  For
example, consider the binary function #$BorderBetweenFn.  We could use
the ternary predicate #$bordersOnRegion to relate the two regions to
their border, or we could use the binary predicate #$borderOf to
relate the border to each region it borders.  Sometimes you will need
a different predicate to relate each argument to the NAT; sometimes
you can use the same one.  Often you will find the the underlying
semantic relationship between the NAT and one of its arguments is
#$resultIsaArg or #$resultGenlArg.</p>
    <h3>9.1.2.  <a NAME='137214984'>
How to avoid skipping the predicate</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
CycL is more strongly predicate-based than function-based.  Hence, you
should always have a predicate-based representation; a function-based
representation is optional.  The best way to avoid skipping the
predicate is to think in terms of predicates, and that way you'll only
create functions if their corresponding predicates are already
defined.</p>
    <p>
However, if you come across an example of where the predicate has been
skipped, you can usually use the following set of instructions to
clean it up.</p>

Let's call the instance of #$Function-Denotational FUNC, and you need
to find or create a corresponding predicate, PRED.

<blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
First, make sure that there is no existing predicate which
can fill the role of PRED.</li>
        <li>
If there is not, then create PRED, make it an instance of
#$FunctionalPredicate, and make the appropriate #$argFormat #$SingleEntry
assertion on PRED.</li>
        <li>
Assert the proper arg constraints on PRED.</li>
        <li>
Assert the atomic defining rule for the function,
with forward direction.  For example, if N is 1, the defining rule would be:

<font color='#339900'>
            <tt><pre>
  (PRED (FUNC . ?ARGS) . ?ARGS)</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </li>

<li>
Thereafter, never use a NAT formed with FUNC in a rule.  Use PRED instead.</li>
        <li>
Another thing that is useful to assert is a
functionCorrespondingPredicate-Canonical GAF linking FUNC and PRED.
See #$functionCorrespondingPredicate-Canonical for more details.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>9.1.3.  <a NAME='137237776'>
Examples of skipping the predicate, and how to repair each one
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Here are some more real examples from KB history in which Cycorp
ontological engineers who have skipped the predicate, or have
identified a case of where the predicate was being skipped.</p>
    <h4>9.1.3.a.  
#$VaccineAgainstMicroorganismFn skipping #$vaccineEffectiveMicroorgType</h4>
    <p>
Example:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (and
      (termOfUnit ??VACC (VaccineAgainstMicroorganismFn ?MICTYPE))
      (isa ?MIC ?MICTYPE))
    (hasAttributes ?MIC Pathogenic))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Using #$termOfUnit in the above fashion is writing what is in essence
a semantic rule based instead on a happenstance syntactic form.  This
is directly the essence of why the predicate shouldn't be "skipped".</p>
    <p>
Instead, we should have #$vaccineEffectiveMicroorgType
which provides a semantic relationship between ?TERM and ?MICTYPE.</p>
    <p>
Then we would have the forward rule:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  ;; define NAT in terms of predicate
     (implies
        (termOfUnit ?VACC (VaccineAgainstMicroorganismFn ?MICTYPE))
        (vaccineEffectiveMicroorgType ?MICTYPE ?VACC))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Then, the above rule can be reformulated as this semantic rule:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
   ;; ??VACC naming convention since the variable is a don't care
      (implies
         (and
           (vaccineEffectiveMicroorgType ?MICTYPE ??VACC)
           (isa ?MIC ?MICTYPE))
         (hasAttributes ?MIC Pathogenic))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Even better, we should have</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
   ;; this could justifiably be forward
     (implies
       (vaccineEffectiveMicroorgType ?MICTYPE ??VACC)
        (relationAllInstance hasAttributes ?MICTYPE Pathogenic))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
and leverage the HL modules for relationAllInstance for backward inference.</p>
    <h4>9.1.3.b.  
TravelingByMeansOfFn skipping transportMeansOfType</h4>
    <p>
Example:</p>
    <p>
The following query</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (tourTransportTypes EHbT-Tour 
    (TravelingByMeansOfFn ?TBT))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
relying on the supporting rule in TourAndVacationPackageItinerariesMt
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies 
    (and 
      (tourHighlights EHbT-Tour ?EVENT-TYPE) 
      (genls ?EVENT-TYPE ?TRAVELINGBYMEANSOFFN) 
      (termOfUnit ?TRAVELINGBYMEANSOFFN 
        (TravelingByMeansOfFn ?MEANS)))
    (tourTransportTypes EHbT-Tour ?TRAVELINGBYMEANSOFFN))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
is an example of skipping the predicate for #$TravelingByMeansOfFn.</p>
    <p>
We should have transportMeansOfType</p>
    <p>
1 forward rule :</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
   (implies
     (termOfUnit ?NAT (TravelingByMeansOfFn ?VEHICLE-TYPE))
     (transportMeansOfType ?VEHICLE-TYPE ?NAT))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
All 6 rules involving</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (termOfUnit ?NAT (TravelingByMeansOfFn ?VEHICLE-TYPE))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
should be written in terms of #$transportMeansOfType</p>
    <p>
The query could then be</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
 (thereExists ?TRANSPORT-TYPE
  (and
   (tourTransportTypes EHbT-Tour ?TRANSPORT-TYPE)
   (transportMeansOfType ?VEHICLE-TYPE ?TRANSPORT-TYPE)))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<h4>9.1.3.c.  
BodyPartFn skipping anatomicalParts</h4>
    <p>
Example:</p>
    <p>
The function #$BodyPartFn in the KB is insufficiently defined
unless it is hooked up to a predicate.  In this case, the
predicate #$anatomicalParts exists, and we can either use
that predicate, or create a more precise spec-pred of
#$anatomicalParts.</p>
    <b>
Don't skip the predicate</b>
    <p>
A rule like this would be skipping the predicate:
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (isa ?GIRAFFE Giraffe)
    (hasVisibleSurfacePatternType 
      (BodyPartFn ?GIRAFFE Neck-AnimalBodyPart)
      SpottedPattern))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Or, after canonicalization,</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (and
      (isa ?GIRAFFE Giraffe)
      (termOfUnit ?BODYPARTFN (BodyPartFn ?GIRAFFE Neck-AnimalBodyPart)))
    (hasVisibleSurfacePatternType ?BODYPARTFN SpottedPattern))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
So, the right way to write this rule, instead of linking the giraffe
with its neck via the syntactic relationship #$termOfUnit, is to create
a new predicate to use as the underlying semantic relationship.  Let's
call it #$uniqueBodyParts, and rewrite the rule as follows:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (and
      (isa ?GIRAFFE Giraffe)
      (isa ?NECK Neck-AnimalBodyPart)
      (uniqueBodyParts ?GIRAFFE ?NECK))
    (hasVisibleSurfacePatternType ?NECK SpottedPattern))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<b>
Multiple functions can use the same predicate</b>
    <p>
The suggested way to fix the "Skipping the Predicate" malady does not
require that there must be a 1-1 relationship between denotational
functions and their underlying predicates.</p>
    <p>
There just should not be a 1-0 relationship for any of them.  </p>
    <p>
So several functions could relate to the same predicate, like
#$anatomicalParts.  Hence we do not need to create #$uniqueBodyParts
just for this reason, and in fact our rule would be even better and
more general if we used #$anatomicalParts instead of
#$uniqueBodyParts.</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (and
      (isa ?GIRAFFE Giraffe)
      (isa ?NECK Neck-AnimalBodyPart)
      (anatomicalParts ?GIRAFFE ?NECK))
    (hasVisibleSurfacePatternType ?NECK SpottedPattern))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
This would apply to, for example, two-necked giraffes.</p>
    <b>
Appendix: An Object-Oriented Programming Analogy</b>
    <p>
For those familiar with object-oriented programming, the
following analogy may help you understand why skipping the predicate
is undesirable.</p>
    <p>
CycL terms are like objects, and NATs are like specialized
constructors for objects.  When you're designing an object hierarchy,
it's important to have the methods inherit from the class, not from
the particular way it was constructed.  Skipping the predicate is like
putting all the methods inside the constructor.  The methods should
apply to any instance of a class, regardless of the method by which
that object was constructed.</p>
    <h2>9.2.  <a NAME='137335352'>
"Don't-Care" Variables</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>9.2.1.  <a NAME='137338880'>
What are don't-care variables?</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
A special naming convention for CycL variables is the "??" prefix.
By prepending two question marks instead of just one, this indicates
to Cyc that the variable is a "don't-care" variable.  "Don't-care"
variables are variables in rules for which you don't care about the
bindings.  Here's an example usage of a don't-care variable.
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (singular ?WORD ??STRING)
    (posForms ?WORD SimpleNoun))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
This rule says that if a word has a singular form, no matter what the
singular form is, the word is going to be a SimpleNoun.</p>
    <h3>9.2.2.  <a NAME='137347312'>
Why are don't-care variables useful?</a>
    </h3>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (objectHasColor ?OBJECT CrimsonColor)
    (objectHasColor ?OBJETC RedColor))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Because of the typo in the second variable, this is logically
equivalent to</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
    (or
      (forAll ?OBJECT
        (not
          (objectHasColor ?OBJECT CrimsonColor)
      (forAll ?OBJETC
        (objectHasColor ?OBJETC RedColor))))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
So, either every object is non-crimson, or every object is red.
Although implausible, this is semantically well-formed.  Typos in
variables can lead to outrageous inferences.  To help ontologists track
these down, there are diagnostics (accessible via the Diagnose button
in the Cyc Browser) that can be applied to rules to identify variables
that only appear once in a rule.  However, occasionally you want to
use a variable exactly once in a rule, as in the original example:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
  (implies
    (singular ?WORD ??STRING)
    (posForms ?WORD SimpleNoun))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<p>
where the variable ??STRING is only mentioned once.  If you explicitly
label such variables as don't-care, as in this example, the
diagnostics will assume you knew what you were doing, and let it be.</p>
