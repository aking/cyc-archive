The OpenCyc Planner 
</h1>
    <p>The OpenCyc Planner is a reimplementation of the 
<a HREF='http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/shop/'>SHOP planner</a> designed to directly access the
Cyc Inference Engine. A planner is an inference engine optimized for
reasoning about actions, events, and other activities in a dynamic
world.</p>
    <h2>1.  <a NAME='#137006096'>Actions</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
Actions are represented as formulas with instances of
<tt><nobr>
#$ActionPredicate</nobr></tt> as their operators. For example, if it is asserted
that: </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$cleans #$Bob #$BobsRoomFloor) </pre></tt>
    </font>
<p>
this represents the fact that Bob
is cleaning the floor of his room in the current context.</p>
    <p>
One uses the planner by giving it a high-level, possibly abstract
action sentence as a goal. For example, </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$transport #$Bob #$AustinBergstromAirport)</pre></tt>
    </font> 
<p>
given to the planner as a goal means that it
should find a sequence of simple actions for getting Bob to the Austin
Bergstrom International Airport.</p>
    <p>
For any context we shall consider instances of
<tt><nobr>
#$SimpleActionPredicate</nobr></tt>, a subcollection of <tt><nobr>
#$ActionPredicate</nobr></tt>, to
define the extent of primitive actions in that context.  These are
actions for which there are no decompositions. Every context should
have a set of simple actions, since they give the vocabulary with
which to express complete plans.  If the plans generated are meant to
be executed, then it makes sense for the simple actions in the domain
to correspond with the simplest actions of the effector.</p>
    <p>
A plan consists of a linear sequence of sentences, whose operators are
instances of <tt><nobr>
#$SimpleActionPredicate</nobr></tt>. It is important to stress that
context should be important in determining whether or not an action
should be represented with a simple action predicate.  Suppose we
wanted to create a planning domain that could power a user
application that would give driving directions between locations in
Austin, TX. It would be inappropriate to have simple actions like 
<tt><nobr>
#$turnKeyInIgnition</nobr></tt>, <tt><nobr>
#$shiftGears</nobr></tt>, and <tt><nobr>
#$changeLanes</nobr></tt>, since we can
assume that most users of the application already know how to drive.
Probably a better vocabulary would have simple action sentences like:
</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$turnLeftAtIntersection (#$RoadIntersectionFn #$SanJacinto #$SixthStreet))
(#$followHighwayRouteUntilExit #$MopacExpressway #$MopacExit43)</pre></tt>
    </font>


<h2>2.  <a NAME='#137041688'>Planner Rule Vocabulary</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>2.1.  <a NAME='#137043640'>

#$PlanningDomainMicrotheory
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The planner takes as one of its inputs a microtheory that sets the
context for the search.  Planner rules using the vocabulary described
above should be asserted in a microtheory that is an instance of
<tt><nobr>
#$PlanningDomainMicrotheory</nobr></tt>.  Every <tt><nobr>
#$genlMt</nobr></tt> of the context mt that is
also an instance of <tt><nobr>
#$PlanningDomainMicrotheory</nobr></tt> is relevant when the
planner looks for applicable rules.</p>
    <h3>2.2.  <a NAME='#137055552'>

Preconditions</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Simple actions can have preconditions. Preconditions are facts that
must be true in the world in order for the particular action to be executable
or applicable. In order to mop the floor of a room, you must be
holding the mop, you must be in or standing next to the room, the
floor can't be covered with carpeting, etc. These facts can all be
represented with preconditions.</p>
    <p>
Usage: </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$preconditionFor-Props CONDITION ACTION)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Comment for <tt><nobr>
#$preconditionFor-Props</nobr></tt>:</p>
    <p>
"A binary predicate which relates instances of ELSentence-Assertible to instances of ELSentence-Assertible, and which is used to state that one formula expresses a necessary precondition for the truth of another. (preconditionFor-Props COND PROP) means that PROP isn't true unless COND is true. Preconditions of various types are distinguished by the more specialized predicates legalPreconditionFor and causalPreconditionFor. See also sufficientFor-Props." </p>
    <p>
Example: </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
       (#$preconditionFor-Props 
             (#$and (#$isa ?CLEANSER #$CleaningSubstance)

<h3>2.3.  <a NAME='#137071376'>
Effects</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
Simple actions are unique in a domain, since they are permitted to
have effects.  Effects are facts that are true in the world after an
action occurs. We use positive literals to represent facts that 
are true in the world after the action is executed. We use negative
literals to represent facts that are made untrue by the execution of
the action.</p>
    <p>
We use the binary predicate <tt><nobr>
#$effectOfAction-Props</nobr></tt> to represent 
literals.</p>
    <p>
Usage:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$effectOfAction-Props ACTION EFFECTS)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Comment for <tt><nobr>
#$effectOfAction-Props</nobr></tt>:</p>
    <p>
"A binary predicate which relates instances of ELSentence-Assertible to instances of ELSentence-Assertible. (effectOfAction-Props ACTION-PROP PROP) means that the effect of ACTION-PROP, where ACTION-PROP is a proposition of the form (PRED . ARGS) and PRED is an instance of ActionPredicate, is PROP, where PROP is any proposition that describes the effect(s) of ACTION-PROP. Thus, effectOfAction-Props should be used only when the first argument is a proposition in which an ActionPredicate is used in the arg0 place." 
</p>
    <p>
Example: </p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$effectOfAction-Props (#$cleans ?AGT ?OBJ) (#$not (#$dirtinessOfObject ?OBJ #$ALittleDirty))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<p>
Effects can also be conditional, meaning that the facts that are true
after the action occurs may be dependent on what is already true. For
rules like these, we use <tt><nobr>
#$effectOfActionIf-Props</nobr></tt>.</p>
    <p>
Usage:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$effectOfActionIf-Props ACTION CONDITION EFFECTS)</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
Comment for <tt><nobr>
#$effectOfActionIf-Props</nobr></tt>:
</p>
    <p>
"A ternary predicate which relates three instances of ELSentence-Assertible. (effectOfActionIf-Props ACTION COND EFFECT) means that if COND is true in the context in which ACTION occurs, then ACTION makes EFFECT true. This predicate was designed to be used in the specification of planning domains (see PlanningDomainMicrotheory). ACTION should be an atomic sentence with an ActionPredicate as the formula operator (i.e. in the arg0 position). See also the binary predicate effectOfAction-Props." </p>
    <p>
Example: A more subtle notion of cleaning:</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
(#$effectOfActionIf-Props (#$cleans ?AGT ?OBJ) 
    (#$and (#$dirtinessOfObject ?OBJ ?OLD-DIRTINESS) 
           (#$followingValue ?NEW-DIRTYNESS ?OLD-DIRTYNESS))
    (#$and (#$not (#$dirtynessOfObject ?OBJ ?OLD-DIRTYNESS))
                  (#$dirtynessOfObject ?OBJ ?NEW-DIRTYNESS)))</pre></tt>
    </font>

<p>
In this example the dirtyness of an object is an instance of <tt><nobr>
#$Dirtiness</nobr></tt>
which can range from <tt><nobr>
#$ReallyDirty</nobr></tt> to <tt><nobr>
#$Sterile</nobr></tt>. Each execution of the 
cleaning action on the same object will raise its cleaniness one step.</p>
    <h3>2.4.  <a NAME='#137121672'>
Complex Actions and Methods
</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
SHOP is an example of a Hierarchical Task Network planner. Most of the
knowledge it uses is in the form of method decompositions. Methods
encapsulate the approach of solving problems by breaking them down
into smaller subproblems. For example, cleaning the floor can be
achieved, if it is not carpeted, by mopping the floor . Mopping the
floor can be achieved by acquiring a mop and a pail of soapy water,
mopping each square meter of the floor separately, and then cleaning
the mop and emptying the pail. Mopping each square meter involves
wetting the mop, wringing out the mop, swabbing the square meter
section, checking to see if it is still dirty, and repeating if
necessary. Each of these can be represented as a single method rule in
the Cyc KB.</p>
    <p>
      <tt><nobr>
#$methodForAction</nobr></tt> rules associate a complex action with its
decomposition.</p>
    <font color='#339900'>
      <tt><pre>
      (#$implies FORMULA 
         (#$methodForAction (COMPLEXACTIONPRED . ARGS)
         (#$actionSequence 
           (#$TheList 
              (SUBACTION1 ) 
              (SUBACTION2 ) 
              (SUBACTION3 )))))</pre></tt>
    </font>


<p>
      <tt><nobr>#$sufficientFor-Props</nobr></tt> rules specify the conditions under which a
complex action has a trivial decomposition. Sometimes it is not
necessary to add the decomposed primitive actions of a complex action
to a plan, when the purpose of that complex action has already been
achieved by steps taken earlier in the plan. These kinds of rules
aid in representing a domain since we can then specify method
decomposition rules in their most general form, without enumerating
all the possible exceptions when part of the decomposition could be
redundant.</p>
