<a name="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
The purpose of this document is to describe the process by which a
real planning domain can be represented in the Cyc KB. It is assumed
that the reader already has some experience with knowledge entry
and some knowledge of the issues involved in ontological design.
</p>

<p>
The domain in question, computer programming, has been selected for
several reasons. Firstly, it is relatively easy to implement this
domain up to the execution level. The programs produced by the planner
in this domain should be amenable to being compiled, interpreted, and
run. Secondly, computers in general are already a fairly discrete
world that lends itself well to near complete representation in
predicate logic. Thirdly, this domain effectively demonstrates in
action several key Cyc technologies for knowledge representation and
reasoning.
</p>

<p>
Our purpose here is to describe the process of creating the domain
and exploring how that domain can interact with the rest of the KB and
be used for interesting applications. In the process, we will show how
to make best use the inference engine and the SHOP planner.
</p>

<p>
This problem domain was an interesting exercise in ontological
engineering, since much of the vocabulary we needed for preconditions
did not exist. This allowed the KB representation of the program
model to grow and be influenced by the parallel development of the
planning domain. Since domain-specific knowledge is scarce in the KB,
this will likely be the normal state of affairs.
</p>

<p> 
Go to <a href="#Appendix A">Appendix A</a> for some example plan tasks
to try, and for a discussion of the programming domain as it is 
represented in the Cyc KB. 
<a href="#Appendix B">Appendix B</a> is a list of some
possible extensions to the domain that would make interesting projects
for the interested ontological engineer.
</p>

<a name="ontology"><h2>Planning Domain Ontology</h2></a>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>
A Planner is by its very nature a general purpose problem solver. As
an extension to the Cyc inference engine, its power is harnessed via
rules and assertions in the KB. Applications using the planner may
have special code for processing, displaying, or even executing plans,
but the heart of the application will be the planner rules themselves.
</p>

<p>
Creating a planning domain is a very similar act to programming. Often
rules when first conceived will not work as expected. This is because
the rules are inherently linked together, and a failure anywhere might
break the entire plan. Thus, it is normal to spend a period of debugging
whenever a planning domain is extended with new rules, or when a new
world model representation requires editing rule preconditions.
</p>

<p>
A rough algorithm for designing a planning domain: 
<ol>
<li>
Design the world representation
</li>
<li>
Design the primitive action layer
</li>
<li>
Design the hierarchy of complex actions
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
This algorithm is very rough. In fact, it may be true that no planning
domain is ever designed this way. In reality, it seems more likely
that design will become an iterative process, during which mistakes
are made and lessons learned. But this algorithm is still valuable,
since it also communicates the inherent dependencies of the various
parts of the planning domain. It is guaranteed that a change in your
world model representation will force changes to your planner rules.
However, there may be many possible networks of complex actions that
reasonably represent the abstract activities of the plan. Also, the
steps are written in increasing order of the expected amount of
revision each will likely require.
</p>

<a name="Microtheory Structure"><h3>Microtheory Structure</h3></a>

<p>
An important consideration early on is determining how all of the
relevant information is going to be made available to the planner
during its execution.  The SHOP planner is given one (1) microtheory
as a parameter that defines the context in which the planning is
done. However, for real (non-toy) domains it will make sense to
fragment the domain into modular chunks. The reason is that typically
there will actually be several interesting and well defined contexts
that you will be interesting in planning in, and these contexts will
share a lot of their knowledge.
</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4>Case study: Programming in different languages</h4>
<p>
We were particularly interested early on in maximizing the reuse of
planner rules, especially when the domain is extended to cover more
programming languages. We use the microtheory structure of the Cyc KB
to filter rules by programming language. For example, most plans for
writing C programs should be generated either in
#$CProgrammingDomainMt, or in one of its spec-Mts.
</p>

<p>
Much of the organization of a program takes place at an abstract level
in which the syntax of the language does not play a part.  Most of the
planner rules used in defining the abstract structure of a program are
asserted in #$ProgrammingDomainMt.
</p>

<p>
Many programming languages share similar features and syntax. Java,
for instance, borrows heavily from C and C++. We thus can also
identify more specialized areas of abstraction, where rules pertaining
to specific families of languages can be asserted.  Therefore, we have
also created #$CSyntaxProgrammingDomainMt, that has both
#$CProgrammingDomainMt and #$JavaProgrammingDomainMt as
specializations. As an example of the kind of knowledge that would be
asserted at this level, consider that in both languages, code blocks
are bracketed with curly braces. It would be redundant to represent
this fact separately in both specialized microtheories.
</p>

<p>
However, it is not sufficient to define microtheories only for each
programming language. The algorithms used should be kept separate and
here we store them in #$ProgramModelMt. Additionally, during
implementation certain assumptions are made about, for instance, how
data types correspond to the information they represent. This kind of
information is stored in microtheories like #$CProgrammingTestMt,
which can see their respective language mts.
</p>
</div>

<a name="effects"><h3>Effects</h3></a>

<p>
There are two types of simple action rules, preconditions and effects.
Preconditions can be considered to be a specialization of method rules
so we discuss them further in the section on complex action rules. Cyc
current uses two different effect predicates: #$effectOfAction-Props,
and #$effectOfActionIf-Props. 
</p>

<p>
Good planner rules allow the right information to be available
at each step of the planner's decision-making. There are two ways for
this information to flow: Primarily, it can flow down the hierarchy,
through the variable bindings of matching complex action
preconditions, applied to the actions of their associated
decompositions. Secondarily, it can flow through the preconditions of
later actions matching the effects of previous actions.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that in some domains that the effects of actions play a
relatively small part in the planning process. The primary purpose of
effect rules in a planning domain is that they allow the signalling of
information to later steps in the planning process. The SHOP planner
plans for tasks in the same order they are to be executed; this means
that in some cases decisions made when expanding earlier complex tasks
in the plan will constrain the planning for later tasks. For example,
consider a domain for traveling to work. At the beginning of the journey,
one may have the option of riding the bus or driving a car. But once
the plan involves a phase of bus riding, the planner should prune away
all successive actions that involve driving, since riding the bus means
leaving the car behind.
</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4>Case Study: Function definitions</h4>

<p>
Early on in the designing the programming domain, we decided that the
program itself would be a sequence of program tokens. Since appending
a token to the end of a text file is a fairly innocuous action, it did
not have an effect that we needed the planner to reason with. However,
if this domain was to be extended to the writing of entire programs
rather than single functions, we would need a much richer effect
ontology for communicating between plan states. Why? Well, say we are
writing a program for statistical analysis of some set of data. Well,
at some high level we would decide we needed a function for computing
averages over a set of numbers. Well at the point that decision is
made, the actual details of that function are not relevant. But at
some point later in the program, when we actually want to call our
function, those details of its signature and interface <em>are</em>
important. It would make for an ugly hierarchy to have this function
specific information to go through the hierarchy as variable bindings.
So the correct solution would be to ensure some of the primitive
actions include effects that add the functions details to world state
as perceived by the later plan states where the function calls will
possible be planned.
</p>
</div>

<a name="complex action rules"><h3>Complex Action Rules</h3></a>

<p>
A planning domain is only as good as its rules. Unfortunately,
planning domains are inherently interdependent structures. One bad
rule can totally ruin the performance of the planner on many problems.
Sometimes the preconditions of the rule can be incredible expensive.
</p>

<p>
It is helpful when design method rules to consider the nature of the
information flow during the planning process. Each method rule
encapsulates a point of decision making for the planner. The decision
is always whether the rule should fire; i.e. whether the search space
should include a node with this rule's decomposition pushed onto its
stack. It makes this decision based on information from two sources:
variable bindings from the world state, and variable bindings for the
action predicates arguments passed to the rule from successful method
rules encounter previously during planning. 
</p>

<p>
Since the information flow into the rule from these two sources can
change as the design evolves, it should be expected that these rules
will change as well, and even the argument constraints and arity of
the action predicate itself may change.
</p>

<p>
Some heuristics:
<ol>
<li>
While there is no hard constraint limiting the size of method
rules, historically our planner rules have usually around half a dozen
preconditions and no more than half a dozen subtasks in their
decomposition.
</li>
<li>
We enforce modularity by being selective about the
preconditions. At each stage we should include in the preconditions
only that information necessary for ensuring the legality of its
associated decomposition.
</li>
<li>
While in an ideal world, the planner would be able to handle any
representation, we find that sometimes we must tailor our
representation to facilitate its querying by the planner.
</li>
<li>
CycL has a sophisticated array of evaluatable functions available.
Often will want to pass variables to the decomposition action formulas
with that require something beyond the mere binding against GAFs in
the KB. 
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
We now will consider some different problems that arose during the
development of the programming domain, and their solutions.
</p>


<div class="sidebar">
<h4>Case Study: Program Expressions</h4>

<p>
One of the major problems that needed addressing in this domain was
that there needed to be some mechanism for translating nested program
expressions into the appropriate programming language, such as:

<pre><code>
(#$SqrtFn 
   (#$PlusFn
      (#$TimesFn (#$ParameterValueFn XSide)
		 (#$ParameterValueFn XSide))
      (#$TimesFn (#$ParameterValueFn YSide)
		 (#$ParameterValueFn YSide))))
</code></pre>

The solution was to use recursive planner rules to implement a
"Visitor" pattern over CycL formulas representing the expressions. The
planner would recursively try to expand each part of the formula and
translate it appropriately. Here is an example of such a rule, in this
case used for expanding binary functions in expressions when
translating for Lisp:

<pre><code>
(#$implies 
       (#$programFunctionOperator ?RELN ?OPERATOR) 
       (#$methodForAction 
           (#$doOutputProgramExpression ?HACKER ?FILE 
               (?RELN ?ARG1 ?ARG2)) 
           (#$actionSequence 
               (#$TheList 
                   (#$outputProgramToken ?HACKER ?FILE "(") 
                   (#$doOutputProgramOperator ?HACKER ?FILE ?OPERATOR) 
                   (#$doOutputProgramExpression ?HACKER ?FILE ?ARG1) 
                   (#$doOutputProgramExpression ?HACKER ?FILE ?ARG2) 
                   (#$outputProgramToken ?HACKER ?FILE ")"))))) 
</code></pre>

<p>
Since the tokens used to represent the functions like #$TimesFn can be
language dependent, we represented the mapping via the binary
predicate #$programFunctionOperator.  whose GAFs are asserted in
microtheories specific to each programming language,
i.e. #$CProgrammingLanguageMt, #$CommonLispProgrammingLanguageMt, etc.
</p>
</div>

<div class="sidebar">
<h4>Case Study: Joining Sequence Variable Lists</h4>

<p>
Since CycL already includes an extensive vocabulary of evaluatable
functions, including many mathematical and set theoretic functions,
and list and string manipulation functions, we wanted to leverage that
existing work as much as possible in this new domain.
</p>

<p>
For instance, within a function definition, there is some structure
that defines the local variables used in that function. In our program
representation, we have two predicates, #$programAlgorithmOutputs and
#$programAlgorithmInternals that relate an algorithm with the software
parameters it needs to declare locally. While it would possible to
have a third predicate, #$programAlgorithmLocals, store the
concatenation of both list, it would not be ideal since the knowledge
would be duplicated in the KB. 
</p>

<p>
It would be better to be able to combine both lists on the fly.  The
following method for action rule bind each list of parameters to
?OUTVARS and ?INTERNALS. Note that ?INTERNALS is a sequence variable
and ?OUTVARS is not, since ?ALGORITHM should only be bound to an
instance of #$FunctionalAlgorithm. We then use a combination of
#$TheList, #$JoinListsFn, and #$evaluate to compute the concatenation
of the two lists, which is then passed as an argument to a
#$doOpenLocalVariables Scope action.
</p>

<p align="center"><pre><code>
(#$implies 
   (#$and 
    (#$programAlgorithmInternals ?ALGORITHM . ?INTERNALS) 
    (#$algorithmStartStep ?ALGORITHM ?STEP) 
    (#$programAlgorithmOutputs ?ALGORITHM ?OUTVARS) 
    (#$programStrings ?ALGORITHM ?ALG-NAME) 
    (#$equals ?JOINLISTSFN 
    (#$TheList . ?LOCALS)) 
    (#$evaluate ?JOINLISTSFN 
    (#$JoinListsFn 
      (#$TheList ?OUTVARS) 
      (#$TheList . ?INTERNALS))) 
    (#$termOfUnit ?PARAMETERVALUEFN 
      (#$ParameterValueFn ?OUTVARS))) 
   (#$methodForAction 
    (#$doDefineProgramFunctionFromAlgorithm ?HACKER ?FILE ?ALGORITHM)
      (#$actionSequence 
       (#$TheList 
        (#$doOutputProgramFunctionHeader ?HACKER ?FILE ?ALGORITHM) 
        (#$doOpenLocalVariablesScope ?HACKER ?FILE . ?LOCALS) 
        (#$doProgramStep ?HACKER ?FILE ?STEP) 
        (#$doOutputFunctionReturn ?HACKER ?FILE ?ALGORITHM ?PARAMETERVALUEFN) 
        (#$doCloseLocalVariablesScope ?HACKER ?FILE . ?LOCALS) 
        (#$doCloseFunctionDefinition ?HACKER ?FILE 
          (#$AlgorithmFunctionFn ?ALGORITHM ?ALG-NAME))))))
</code></pre></p>
</div>

<h2>Debugging Tricks</h2>

<p>
Do not be surprised when you carefully designed planning domain fails
to return plans right away. The rule interactions are complicated and
it is very hard to assert the rules correctly the first time. Here are
some pointers that might help the debugging process:
<ol>
<li>
Use the verbose mode. Setting the verbosity of the planner, either
throw the parameter of <code>shop-find-plans</code> or otherwise,
will give you more information about where in the planning process
the error occurred. A verbosity of 0 means no extra output, and a 
value of 9 means the highest level of extra information.  
</li>
<li>
It will sometimes be the case, especially when designing domains with
recursive method rules, or when preconditions are extremely expensive
to compute, that the planner will run of into the weeds trying its
best to find a solution. Since we do not currently have a method for
interrupting the planning process, it is usually a good idea to set
the depth and time cutoffs to reasonable values. The time cutoff does
the obvious thing. Every time a method rule is successfully applied to
a node, the children of that node have their depth value incremented
by one. Depth is therefore a rough guide of the progress of the
planner on a particular task. If the planner tries to expand nodes of
a depth greater than your predefined limit, it will halt immediately.
</li>
<li>
Work backwards. It is much more efficient to make the complex rules
that are closer to the primitive level work properly, and then more up
to the more abstract actions. By working backwards you can build the
domain one level at a time, with each level debugged against a
known-to-be stable base of action rules.  The planner can be called on
any action predicate formula, and will plan for even the smallest
subactions in a larger conceived plan. There is nothing that forces
plan tests to be executed at the highest possible level.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<!-- something conclusive here -->

<a name="Appendix A"><h2>Appendix A</h2></a>

<h3>Example Plan Tasks</h3>

<ol>
<li>Try the plan:
<code>(#$doDefineProgramFunctionFromAlgorithm #$Thing #$Thing #$AbsoluteValueComputation)</code><br> 
in either <code>#$CProgrammingTestMt</code> or 
<code>#$CommonLispProgrammingTestMt.</code>
</li>

<li>Try the plan:
<code>(#$doDefineProgramFunctionFromAlgorithm #$Thing #$Thing #$MaxElementComputation)</code><br> 
in either <code>#$CProgrammingTestMt</code> or 
<code>#$CommonLispProgrammingTestMt.</code>
</li></ol>

<p>
For example,
<blockquote>
<code>
CYC(1): (csetq plans (shop-find-plans '(#$doDefineProgramFunctionFromAlgorithm #$Thing #$Thing #$MaxElementComputation) #$CProgrammingTestMt)<br>
CYC(2): (punless (null plans)
	  (csetq actions (shop-plan-simple-actions (first plans))))
</code></blockquote>

will bind <code>actions</code> to a list of simple action formulas that constitute a plan for writing code that computes the maximum element of 
a list in the C programming language.</p>

<h3>Algorithm Representation</h3>

<p>
While it is important that the programs produced by the planner be
valid, we would like further to analyze the algorithms involved
abstracted away as much as possible from their implementation in the
syntax of the programming languages themselves.
</p>

<h4>Program Steps</h4>
<p>
We currently support the representation of functional algorithms,
i.e. functions which compute only one data object. This collection is
denoted by the term #$FunctionalAlgorithm.
We represent an
algorithm as a mapping between program steps. It is conceptually very
similar to the old style logic flowcharts.
</p>

<p>
Program steps are always instances of #$ProgramStep. We associate an
algorithm with its first step with the predicate
#$algorithmStartStep. Individual program steps of an algorithm can be
denoted with the function #$AlgorithmStepFn. Other program steps can
be denoted with special purpose functions like #$ProgramAssignmentFn
and #$MakeFunctionCallInProgramFn.
</p>

<p>
There are several predicates that can be used to define the
relationships between the program steps: 
<blockquote><code>
#$programIfConditionThenElse<br>
#$programWhileConditionDo<br>
#$hasSequentialProgramSteps
</code></blockquote>
</p>

<h4>Tokens</h4>
<p>
Most named entities in a program, such as parameters and functions,
will have a #$programStrings assertion on them, that will indicate
(within the current context) what the string should be used in the
program for that entity.
</p>

<h4>Variables</h4>
<p>
Variables are crucial to algorithm representation. We use instances of
#$SoftwareParameter as variables or, as we call them here, parameters.
Initial values for parameters are represented with
#$initialParameterValue GAFs. The value of a parameter can be denoted
via the unary function #$ParameterValueFn. In practice, this is
similar to the '$' prefix used in bash shell scripting when accessing
the value of an environment variable.  This function maps a parameter
to the information that its actual interal value is meant to
represent. For example, in a C program where #$Counter is has type
<code>int</code>, then (#$ParameterValueFn #$Counter) would denote an
instance #$Integer, not some bitfield that is the actual
representation of that integer in memory.
</p>

<h4>Expressions</h4>
<p>
The CycKB already has extensive knowledge about many of the
mathematical functions we would be interested in using in program
expressions. We use these functions as much as possible in the CycL
representation of program steps, thereby establishing the semantic
roots of the expression within pre-existing CycL. We use the binary
predicate #$programFunctionOperator to represent the mapping between
the CycL functions and their programming language counterparts.
</p>

<h4>Statement Parts</h4>
<p>
Many programming languages have very similar kinds of statements. For
example, usually an <code>if/then/else</code> statement is almost
standard, as is some kind looping construct. Since these forms are so
common we can abstract them out to a language independent level, and
have merely a mapping between <em>parts</em> of the statement and
tokens in the language. This is the main reason for the action
predicate #$doOutputStatementPart and the represented instances of
#$ProgramSyntaxObject, such as #$IfStatement-StartIf and
#$IfStatement-Then.
</p>

<h4>Domain Extent</h4>
<p>
At the current stage the domain represents only the programming of
individual functions. To really useful, we need to extend the domain
to include complete programs that meet specified requirements; 
use more of the existing #$Algorithm ontology to represent how different
algorithms are combined to form complex programs; and look for
ways of automating a link between program specifications and programs
themselves.
</p>

<a name="Appendix B"><h2>Appendix B: Extensions</h2></a>

<p>
The domain is currently only a small prototype. There are many ways it
could be easily extended to cover more of the programming domain
space. We now give some suggestions for projects that the interested
student may wish to work on:
</p>

<p><ol>
<li>
Extend the representation to pointer referencing/dereferencing.
Allow a capability for pointer arithmetic.
</li>
<li>
Extend the representation to gracefully handle C-style bitwise
operations.
</li>
<li>
Create a framework for software modules/packages. Allow the
automatic mapping of functions like #$TangentFn and #$SineFn to
functions in a mathematics subroutine library only when that
library is available.
</li>  
<li>
Extend existing vocabulary to handle object oriented programming,
specifically the manipulation of class definitions, method
declarations, and method invocation.
</li>
<li>
Namespaces and identifiers are currently given a very cursory
treatment. Ideally we would like to automatically generate meaningful
identifier strings for variables such that there are no collisions in
the namespace. Presumably assertions in the KB (perhaps something
involving #$programStrings, or perhaps some more complicated scheme)
would be used to give "hints" to the planner.
</li>
<li>
Develop a framework for doing software verification in CycL. Extend
CycL to enable the application (or implementation) of software
engineering tools upon the CycL representation.
</li>
<li>
Extend existing functionality to include bash shell scripting.  With
the representation of the typical tool set of the average Linux user,
develop a methodology that allows the planner to usefully chain
together commands like <code>grep</code> and <code>find</code>, using
piping and i/o indirection, like <code>grep</code> and
<code>find</code>, to extract information from both the user
environment, and from text file based knowledge sources with known
formats. Simple queries for information by the user could serve as the
high level goals for plans to actively process those files and extract
their information as an answer to the query.
</li>
</ol></p>
