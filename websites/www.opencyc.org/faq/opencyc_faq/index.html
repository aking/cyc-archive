Not 100% at this time. Cycorp intends to sell premium products and services using its inference engine, which has been designed to work with the Cyc Knowledge Base in an optimal fashion. Cycorp provides a reference Cyc Server executable for Intel-based Linux and for Windows 2000 along with the release. This includes a basic implementation of its inference engine, without source code, but with a irrevocably free license. You are free to use this engine in free or commercial applications with a guarantee of no license fee ever.

    <p>Yes, OpenCyc may be freely copied, distributed and used for commercial or non-commercial purposes according to the terms of the OpenCyc license. OpenCyc is currently released under the Appache License, Version 2. (More information on OpenCyc licensing can be found <a href="http://opencyc.org/license/license">here</a>.)

Qualified parties can obtain a free license to a substantially larger subset of the Cyc Knowledge Base known as <a href="http://researchcyc.cyc.com"> ResearchCyc </a> which is for R&amp;D use only. The complete Cyc Knowledge Base can be licensed from Cycorp, Inc. for commercial use. Terms for licensing the complete Cyc KB are negotiated on an individual basis.

Are there any negative outcomes you want to guard against?
</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
There are two things we'd like to insure against that at first might seem to be at odds with each other.
 First, we want to keep the KB from diverging, which occurs when changes are made in different 
directions resulting in multiple different versions of the KB that are all actively in use. 
One way to guard against divergence is to require that all core KB content remain open, because 
everyone gets to see and adopt all changes to the core.
The other concern is that the same forced openness that helped prevent divergence
 might cause commercial developers to reject the Cyc platform. After all, they may want
 to sell a proprietary derivative product, so they don't want to be forced to expose all 
of the valuable content they assembled.

How will knowledge be transferred on the OpenCyc-grid?</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>OpenCyc java source code includes agent adapters for both the CoABS and FIPA-OS
 agent communities. CoABS is still proprietary (Global InfoTek from the Darpa CoABS project), 
but FIPA-OS is open source and is one of a number of FIPA compliant agent systems. So the message 
for CoABS and FIPA-OS is similar, and OpenCyc uses the FIPA ACL (Agent Communication Language) form --
 serialized into XML (actually CycML) between agents. But we are looking at peer to peer as the 
infrastructure for distributed OpenCyc, in that the agent communities have centralized directory
 services, and peer to peer builds these on the fly. If the message content and performatives can
 be made identical between agent community and p2p frameworks, then OpenCyc can bridge them when 
appropriate. Think of the grid just as you would think of any of the networking implementations. 
After the Knowledge Grid is implemented, when you launch OpenCyc or talk to an OpenCyc server, 
you will be talking to all connected OpenCycs -- a semantic web.

The intended usage (CycML import/export is not yet available) is to have a sort of

 XSL can be used to transform CycML into various HTML-based views and OpenCyc load utilities
 can be used to load the CycML files into your copy of OpenCyc. You could even download packages 
that include some CycML with SKSI assertions and a database or hash file and get them connected 
up just by loading the CycML and dropping the database/file in the right directory. CycML will be

It gives the Common Lisp functions from which SubL is derived. If a function is not defined in the
 SubL programming document, then very likely it has the signature given by common lisp. 
When we release source code for the Cyc Server, it will likely be SubL that you either load into

the translated C code with the GCC toolchain and static linking to a Cyc object library that we will

The best way to explore the KB is via an HTML browser. When you run OpenCyc, it starts up an HTML

It should display the login window. Log in as CycAdministrator.</p>

You should see "Successful Login Welcome CycAdministrator! Your project is currently not set." 
Now just type any old thing (one of say 5,000 things) into the Complete box in the top frame,

question to ask OpenCyc?</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
First, note that the Ask tool is deprecated and replaced by the Query tool. A simple question to 
ask OpenCyc is (#$genls #$Dog ?X) in the EverythingPSC. In English, that's "What types of things are 
dogs?"
</p>
    <p>
Go to Tools, Query. Then put in (#$genls #$Dog ?X) in the formula field, and EverythingPSC in the 
Mt: box
</p>
    <p>
If the query works, you should see that dogs, amongst other things are Solid Tangible Things, 
Spatial Thing - Localized and EukaryoticOrganism. My favorite one is #$HexalateralObject.  
If you click on the [Explain] next to HexalateralObject, then click on GENLS, it will tell you why 
it knows that dogs have six sides. Since you don't know (much) CycL, you can go to Opt and turn on 
the "Show Assertions in English" option, and it will attempt to paraphrase the CycL into English.
</p>
    <p>
Vertebrae have 6 sides, so eventually it reasons out that dog is a vertebrate. In English, 
it would probably say something like "Every dog is a vertebrate, and every vertebrate has 6 sides".</p>

How can I test the inference engine? Can you recommend a successful query?

    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
Since there are so few rules in OpenCyc 0.6, all queries will be pretty simple until you add your
 own rules.</p>
    <p>
Try this. Add a rule that says that every Cyclist is located in Germany. Go to Tools, Assert,
 and enter:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>

          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>
Now you have a rule. Asserting rules is just like asserting facts (GAFs). Now, using the 
Query tool, ask where the CycAdministrator is.</p>

<!--
After you add constants and assertions of your own, you can save out a new world.
Either in the SubL interactor (available from the Nav screen) or in the xterm
window where you started Cyc:</p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
Type (write-image "world/mynewworld") [where 'mynewworld' is really any filename
you choose.</li>
          <li>
Quit out of Cyc. You can do this by typing '(exit)' [without the quotes but
with the parenthesis] in the window where you started Cyc.</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
The next time you start Cyc, don't use the './runcyc' script. Instead, 
</p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
cd to the run directory
</li>
          <li>
cd to the world directory
</li>
          <li>
check that your 'mynewworld' file is in the world directory
</li>
          <li>
cd .. [back to the run directory]
</li>

[again, 'mynewworld' is whatever filename you used]</li>

    </p>
    <p>
Now the constants and assertions you added last time should be viewable from

The error is occurring when OpenCyc creates a new guid for the term. Of the several standard

 So you currently must have an ethernet card installed on Linux to create constants with OpenCyc. 
We plan to fix this bug to generate a random guid if an ethernet card cannot be found on the host

What can the OpenCyc Planner be used for?
</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>OpenCyc Planner + programming language = generated code.</p>
    <p>
Cycorp has the ambition of showing how OpenCyc can apply commonsense planning with programming language primitives to create programs meeting a user's high level requirements (goal state). Much of the Planner is scheduled to be ready by release 1.0. For the 0.7 release, we should have a small library of functions that can get planned out into several different languages. We may even get far enough to include programming statements.</p>
    <p>The released vocabulary will contain methodForAction, whose consequent is the plan at that step (depth). The 0.7 release is not populated yet with any example axioms, but we're working on that for the next release.
</p>
    <p>
Most planners are propositional. For example, you can ask "Does the monkey hold the stick?", but OpenCyc can be asked to "Prove that the monkey holds the stick or prove that he doesn't hold the stick." We use a derivative of the open source SHOP planner from UMBC. Of course OpenCyc is not complete (by complete, I mean that backchaining rules will not terminate when there are many rules or many values to instantiate, so when you run out of time, there is no answer) and is slower than a purely propositional planner. But for real world apps, you tune the queries with predicates such as highlyRelevantAssertion.</p>
    <p>
highlyRelevantAssertion could be a rule consequent as well. In this way, you can use OpenCyc to make OpenCyc smarter. We also have proof checker mode on asks, where the relevant rules can be specified when you know the general form of repeated queries. There are many ways to make problem inferences faster.

What is a "spindle" in Cycorp terminology?
</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>A spindle is where you have many microtheories that all genl up to one microtheory. Below them all you have a query microtheory that can 'look up' and 'see' the entire spindle. This query microtheory is the bottom of the spindle and is empty, but it can 'see' everything above it, so it a good place to try to do a proof. Microtheories with names that end in "-PSC" are usually at the base of a spindle (PSC stands for Problem Solving Context). So the knowledge of which queries to ask resides in either a different microtheory or in the application which uses OpenCyc.

How is #$forAll used?
</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
#$forAll is Cyc's implementation of the <a HREF='http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=quantifier'>universal quantifier</a> in predicate logic.</p>
    <p>#$thereExists is Cyc's implementation of the existential quantifier.
Any occurrence of a variable in an assertion in the Cyc KB that is not 
explicitly bound by a quantifier is treated as if it were bound by 
an implicit initial '#$forAll'.
Thus, a CycL assertion such as the following:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(implies 
  (isa ?CAT DomesticCat) 
  (eatsWillingly ?CAT Meat))
</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>is interpreted as if it were written thus:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(forAll ?CAT 
  (implies 
    (isa ?CAT DomesticCat) 
    (eatsWillingly ?CAT Meat)))
</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>(Of course, if there is more than one unbound variable in an assertion, 
each is treated as if it were bound by its own #$forAll quantifier.)</p>
    <p>
Such implicit universal quantification makes working in CycL vastly more 
convenient, but it does mean that if one accidentally omits an 
existential quantifier from an assertion this may not be readily apparent, 
as the variable that would have been bound by the omitted existential 
quantifier is assumed to be universally quantified (rather than the 
assertion being rejected as ill-formed). One's assertion will then not 
have the meaning one expects. Consider, for example, the assertion that 
every cat has a tail:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(implies 
  (isa ?CAT DomesticCat) 
  (thereExists ?TAIL 
    (and 
      (isa ?TAIL Tail-BodyPart) 
      (anatomicalParts ?CAT ?TAIL)))).
</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>
If I slip up and write:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>

(implies 
  (isa ?CAT DomesticCat) 
  (and 
    (isa ?TAIL Tail-BodyPart) 
    (anatomicalParts ?CAT ?TAIL)))
</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>
then the meaning of this assertion will be rather different (Exercise for 
the reader: how?)</p>
    <p>
If universal quantification is implicit in the way described above, why 
does CycL even contain the term #$forAll? This is because in certain 
special cases it is necessary that a #$forAll operator be used 
explicitly. Consider the following assertion:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(thereExists ?BELOVED 
  (loves ?LOVER ?BELOVED))
</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>
This states (roughly) that everyone loves someone or other. But 
although everyone has a beloved in this scenario, the person loved may 
differ from lover to lover. What if one wants to assert the stronger 
statement that there is *some particular person* who is loved by everyone? 
Then one needs an assertion such as the following:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>

Our intention at Cycorp is to represent the objective world and allow the representation of agents' beliefs. So we try to do both.

Yes! If I entered false information about a subject and then I entered true

That's the whole point of microtheories.  In fact, you can have microtheories in which every assertion is believed to be false or mythological. So then how does OpenCyc decide which microtheory to believe? It depends on which microtheory you query from in the genlMt hierarchy.

    <p>
Keeping the datasize for an Mt down makes it easier for a person to review the material
in the Mt.  Reasoning over sets of similar object types (rivers, cities, etc.) is sometimes
slowed down the larger the set that is examined.  So if you ask a question in a
microtheory that inherits from SwedenNaturalGeographyMt but not from FinlandNaturalGeographyMt
(or the others) about rivers and the bodies of water into which they flow, the inference
engine would not have to consider the 100,000 lakes in Finland (or however many you enter)
and the rivers in the other Scandinavian countries (or the US).</p>
    <p>
With natural language input, this becomes more important.  For example, if you include
data about all the named farmsteads in Norway and Sweden in the knowledge base and refer
to a farm in Sweden by name, the system could reject parses involving Norwegian farms
of the same name if you are asking the question in a microtheory that inherits from

When deciding whether or not to create new Mts for each country for which you will
add geography data, it would be appropriate to add a set of microtheories, for example,
either for the set of Nordic countries or for each country.  Cycorp has considered
creating them for each country, but has not yet taken that step. If you are going
to cover natural features and geopolitical entities and the relationships among them,
that would mean creating 6 (or more) Mts for each country. For example:</p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
SwedenPoliticalGeographyDataVocabularyMt</li>

        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
If you do not see a need for separate microtheories for each country, you might not need them.
You could make, for example, EuropeanUnion...GeographyMt and NATO...GeographyMt, which would
have genlMts only to the members of those organizations.

    <p>"Cyc" comes from the word "encyclopedia". The Cyc Project set out to represent in computer usable form the knowledge needed to understand an encyclopedia.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>It's a module that hooks into OpenCyc's inference engine to dynamically solve certain kinds of problems.  They can also be used for accessing certain kinds of data, for instance it could hook OpenCyc into some big 20GB of data. Right now, they can only be written in SubL, but it would be a fairly easy extension to allow them to be linked in, or written in Java, or something. There are plans for doing that.

      <b><a NAME='138726032'>What is SKSI?</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>SKSI is Semantic Knowledge Source Integration. The idea is that you map any knowledge source (e.g. a web page, a database) into Cyc via a detailed semantic schema mapping. Then you can ask Cyc queries and it can answer them based on information in any of the knowledge sources it has access to.
</p>
    <p>
If you can write HL modules, you can roll your own SKSI functionality, so you're not dependent on waiting for Cycorp to release anything except the HL module hooks. But at Cycorp we're trying to make it easier and more automatic to hook in new knowledge sources. As of version 0.6b, you can write your own "slurper", which is a tool to slurp knowledge from some data source into Cyc, and store it as assertions in the KB.</p>
    <font face='Arial' size='+1'>
      <b><a NAME='138746728'>How do you write a slurper?</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
Writing a slurper is only slightly more complex than conversion between data formats. It's like converting between, say, SQL and CycL. Let me give you an example. Say you have a database with just two fields, Paper and References, which are both strings.  Then for each row in the database, you use the Cyc API to make an assertion of the form (paperReferences &lt;arg1> &lt;arg2>) where arg1 and arg2 are the two strings.</p>

Can I import genetic information into Cyc?</a></b>

Sure, you can import ANY kind of information into Cyc, you just have to have the underlying vocabulary to represent it, and if it isn't there, you can create it yourself. In the full KB we have lots of knowledge about biology and genetics, but this has not yet been released in OpenCyc.</p>

    <p>
Being able to trail the line of thought. Cyc has a justification for everything it believes, and it always bottoms out into either "X told me so" or "some piece of code says so". A cool consequence of that is if the reason for Cyc believing something goes away, the consequences of that will also go away.</p>

What happens if Cyc decides that human beings are responsible for world chaos? It may decide to eliminate

    <br>
    <p>Because Cyc currently cannot initiate any actions, we are safeguarded for now from the potential catastrophe you describe.</p>

How can I find the lexical word (a Cyc term with the suffix "-TheWord") corresponding to a string such as "eating", for
example?</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
When you type 'Eat' (without the quotes) into the completion box of the KB Browser, it takes you
to the screen for 'EatingEvent'. From there, click on 'Lexical Info' near the
top of the left frame. That will show you the denotation assertions, such as
the ones for 'Eat-TheWord' and 'Dine-TheWord'.</p>
    <p>
When you do a Query to find which word units are associated with the
string "eating", you don't get #$Eat-TheWord. This is because
predictable inflectional variants are not explicitly stored in the KB.
If you look at #$Eat-TheWord, you will see "eat", "eaten", and "ate",
but not "eating", since the gerund form is derivable by rule. Currently,
these inflectional variants are figured out by the (unreleased)
morphology code module, not by rules in the KB.</p>
    <p>
We are moving to a new representational scheme where morphological
processes will be explicitly represented in the KB.  Take a look at
#$NLMorphologyTerm to get an idea of how this will work when it is fully
implemented.</p>
    <p>
We will add words-of-string to the API. This function looks both at
forms stored explicitly in the KB, and those derived by the morphology
code. So, in the SubL interactor, you will be able to evaluate forms
like this:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>

-> #$Eat-TheWord</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
Until then, the best way to find words from a string is the way 
described in the first paragraph: typing the string into the constant
 complete box, and clicking on Lexical Info to find the word units.

Because there are so many concepts and assertions in OpenCyc, it seems that there should 
be some kind of database where these are stored that I can update. But I can't find the database 
after installing. Where is it?</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
The Cyc Knowledge Server has its own proprietary storage mechanism built in.
Concepts and assertions are stored in a "world" file. The one that comes with
the download is the file named latest.load in the run/world/ directory.</p>
    <p>
After you add constants and assertions of your own, you can save out a new world.
Either in the SubL interactor (available from the Nav screen) or in the xterm
window where you started Cyc:</p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
Type (write-image "world/mynewworld") [where 'mynewimage' is really any filename
you choose.</li>
          <li>
Quit out of Cyc. You can do this by typing '(exit)' [without the quotes but
with the parens) in the window where you started Cyc.</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
The next time you start Cyc, don't use the './runcyc' script. Instead, 
</p>
    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
cd to the run directory
</li>
          <li>
cd to the world directory
</li>
          <li>
check that your 'mynewworld' file is in the world directory
</li>
          <li>
cd .. [back to the run directory]
</li>
          <li>
type: bin/latest.bin -w world/mynewworld
[again, 'mynewworld' is whatever filename you used]</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
Now the constants and assertions you added last time should be viewable from
the KB browser.</p>
    <p>
You can keep saving worlds out under new names if you want to keep a revision
history, and you can delete old worlds at any time.</p>
    <p>
As for databases, there are two main ways Cyc can be used with databases. There
is SKSI (Semantic Knowledge Source Integration), which lets data from databases
be available to the knowledge base as virtual data (expected in version 1.0)
and there's work being done on a 'backing store', which will be disk-based storage
that at first will be used for some of the more data-like content in the KB.

No. You have to define new terms before you use them in an assertion. The easiest way to do

</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Yes. When you use telnet, you use SubL because you are speaking directly into the interpreter -- the same as command line.</p>
    <p>
We have a special interpreter for OpenCyc that guards the system and whose behavior will be exposed by the upcoming security model so that you can say which functions are legal. Full Cyc has approximately 10,000 functions and we expose about 400 top level ones in the API currently (v0.6). More will come when the RKF (knowledge acquisition) tools are included in the build (release 1.0). The API are those functions that will stay backward compatible. Lower level function definitions change all the time -- daily.</p>
    <font face='Arial' size='+1'>
      <b><a NAME='139527056'>
About backchaining, does OpenCyc make deductions during assertion time so that even though the backchaining is set low it might not mean that a rule won't be used?
 
</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Correct. Forward chaining (per rule at assert time) asserts facts that you later just look up. When you assert a rule, you say whether it is forward or backward. The great majority of rules are backward, or rules are made forward for a one-time propagation. When trying to decide on direction, try backwards first. If queries are slow, you can go forwards to precache answers. But forward inference can conclude lots and lots of uninteresting facts.

I've heard that OpenCyc is being used with games. How?
</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
One OpenCyclist is using the OpenCyc inference engine and knowlede Browser and interfacing to his own definition of rooms and their environments. The datamodel for his game is much smaller than what it represents because it uses inference to make exstentials into objects (objects in the OO sense). In OpenCyc they remain logical objects but they reifiy into the game as tangible room objects, so inhabitants will see two arms for all humans that exist or tables in every dinning room, etc. This is a big benefit of using OpenCyc: you can query OpenCyc for common knowledge instead of having it all in your local memory.</p>
    <p>
So how can you communicate with the objects? Currently you can use the 'bsh' API over telnet. There are generic RMI/Soap possiblitities. Python could telnet there. You'd make program-friendly interfaces/methods on the Python object that telnets there. Then your program would use the program side of your usage API and on the other side Python would be jumping through the hoops to make it happen. When a lower level made for programs becomes better you'd change your connection code to talk to the more direct RMI.</p>
    <p>
For example:
</p>
    <p>
Humans have a 'look' command that lists the objects that are spatiallyConnected to the room they are in (another way to do this is if the human knew CycL, he could query the room). Starting with 'look', Python would send 'look' and the datamodel for the game would give it a list of objects. So you have a method called getRoomContents in Python that takes the variable for the room name.</p>
    <p>
Python would actually first 'teleport &lt;roomname>', then 'look', then take the returned ascii and send that as the result of your getRoomContents roomname. If you needed a better formatted look for Python, you could make a 'pythonlook', but the telnet interface is the easiest to maintain.</p>
    <p>
Right now this game is just text, but it's not hard for someone who loves 3D graphics to make it visual. What they do is write a special client that talks to the server's API.

How I can interact with your system? Can I use Natural Language instead of CycL? How can I submit/get the data?
</a></b>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
You can submit and get data using the API. There is documentation on the
OpenCyc site (SourceForge CVS) for a Java API and for the generic API that 
can be accessed through a telnet connection (using strings of SubL code). 
There is also now an alpha version of a Python API in CVS.</p>
    <p>
As for the particular functions you would call, OpenCyc does not currently
support parsing, but there will be some parsing support (noun phrases,
probably) in version 1.0 of OpenCyc. OpenCyc does currently support generation, 
but we need to get more documentation finished for working with the genTemplate
predicate and with the generate-phrase SubL function. For starters, you
should read the documentation on the OpenCyc site pertaining to NL, but it
would also be useful for you to understand representation with CycL.</p>

I'm trying to get Cyc to store some information about a number of users. Has anyone done something like this before, and does someone happen to have a template (set of assertions) that I might be able to use for this purpose?

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>One way of dealing with such a problem is this:</p>
          <p>
Decide how many categories of users you are going to have and what properties
pertain to each category. For example, you may decide that you have the
following kind of users:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>
Naive</li>
              <li>
Proficient</li>
              <li>
Guru</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
Furthermore, you may have three machines:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>
Cheapo</li>
              <li>
Medio</li>
              <li>
Expenso</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
and decide that only guru users have access to all of them, proficient users to
medio and cheapo and naive users only to cheapo. This you can represent
by means of rules such as:</p>
          <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
                <font color='black'>
                  <tt><pre>

  (and (hasAccess ?USER Expenso)
          (hasAccess ?USER Medio)
          (hasAccess ?USER Cheapo)))</pre></tt>
                </font>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
<p>
-- similarly for the other two cases.</p>
          <p>
Assert these rules in BenZhukUserMt (rename as appropriate) which 
you will have created for the purpose.</p>
          <p>
Now, every time you assert in BenZhukUserMt something like:</p>
          <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>

              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
<p>
the following facts (if asked) will prove true:</p>
          <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>

              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
<p>
Two things to note:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
all of the following constant must already exist and be appropriately defined
in a microtheory visible from BenZhukUserMt:</p>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
remember to link each of the users to their names and IDs by means of assertions
such as:</p>
                <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
                  <tr>

        </li>
<li>
          <p>
If you plan on having a significant number of users
(10,000+) then you should probably plan on using OpenCyc's soon-to-be database
integration functionality.</p>
          <p>
When that becomes available you will no longer need to introduce Cyc constants
such as User001 nor link them to ID's and/or names. All of that will be better
handled by a database with which your copy of OpenCyc will interface. The "logic" however,
i.e. things like:</p>
          <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
                <font color='black'>
                  <tt><pre>
(implies (isa ?USER Guru)
(and (hasAccess ?USER Expenso)
(hasAccess ?USER Medio)
(hasAccess ?USER Cheapo))) </pre></tt>
                </font>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
<p>
will still be on your OpenCyc image. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
Just to show you the abstractions that are possible with
OpenCyc:</p>
          <p>
just like you could have thousands and thousands of users, you may also have
thousands and thousands of resources whose access you may want to control
(as opposed to just three machines as in the example above). To deal with that
case, suppose you have defined three collections:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>
CheapResource</li>
              <li>
AverageResource</li>
              <li>
ExpensiveResource</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
Then you can recast the rule above as
</p>
          <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
            <tr>
              <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>

              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
<p>
with the details of which resource counts as expensive, average or cheap also
being pushed off to a DB.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

To simplify things, create a new microtheory for all of the assertions below.
Maybe call it KimsPracticeMt. In BaseKB, assert:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>

          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
After that, do all your asserts and asks from KimsPracticeMt.</p>
    <p>
Create new constants SeeingAFilm and SeeingADriveInMovie using the Create
tool. Then assert:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
DON'T ASSERT:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
Instead, you have to either talk about a specific movie or (more likely)
talk about all instances by using a rule or a rule macro predicate. You can tell
that #$cost is used with instances of TemporalThing (as opposed to genls of
TemporalThing) by looking at the #$arg1Isa assertion on #$cost. First let's
talk about an individual movie.</p>
    <p>
Create the constant #$KimSeeingTheMatrixThisSaturday
</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>

</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
Then you can talk about the cost of this individual movie:
</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>

</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
Now let's deal with what you probably really meant, which is that movies
generally cost $9 (remember that Cyc can deal with default truths). You could 
use a rule which means, if X is a seeing-a-movie event, then X costs $9. 
This properly uses #$cost at the instance level:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(implies
  (isa ?X SeeingAFilm)
  (cost ?X (Dollar-UnitedStates 9))</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
Rule macro predicates give us a more compact way to deal with these kinds of
rules. You could, instead of the above rule, just say the following:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(relationAllInstance cost SeeingAFilm (Dollar-UnitedStates 9))</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
Now let's deal with the inheritance issue. Since you've said that movies, in
general, cost $9, Cyc should know that, by default, drive-in movies also cost
$9. Let's test this:</p>
    <p>
Create the constant: JohnSeeingStarWarsAtTheDriveIn and assert:</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(isa JohnSeeingStarWarsAtTheDriveIn SeeingADriveInMovie)</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
Then ASK the following:
</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
(cost JohnSeeingStarWarsAtTheDriveIn ?WHAT)</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>
You should get the answer: 
</p>
    <table width='100%' border='0' align='center'>
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor='#d3d3d3'>
          <font color='black'>
            <tt><pre>
Last query in KimsPracticeMt :

Query halted because : Search space was exhausted.


Answer     ?WHAT

[Explain]  (Dollar-UnitedStates 9) 
===============</pre></tt>
          </font>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>
There are other things you could do with this. You could have used the predicate
#$basicPrice-Event instead of #$cost.  But #$basicPrice-Event expects a buying
event as its first argument. You'd introduce a spec of Event like
"BuyingAMovieTicket" and add knowledge about how that usually has to occur before
you can watch a movie.</p>
