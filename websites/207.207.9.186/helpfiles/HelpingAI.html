<h3>Helping Artificial Intelligence</H3>

<ul><li><font color=#cc0000><b>FACTory</b></font> is much more than just a game.
While you're playing, you're teaching an artificial intelligence called <i>Cyc</i>
about the world. The game teaches Cyc the kinds of things that people know but
computers often don't &mdash; in short, <I>common sense.</i> If you've ever
wished your computer software would just show a little bit of common sense
for once, <font color=#cc0000><b>FACTory</b></font> may be a way to help
get there.<p>

<li>Cyc is an AI system that has been under development since 1985. It
knows enough now to come up with its own questions and theories about
the world, and even to look for information on the web, and it has a lot
of questions!<p>

<li>Needless to say, we also want <font color=#cc0000><b>FACTory</b></font>
to be an enjoyable game.

And don't forget to have fun playing!<p>
