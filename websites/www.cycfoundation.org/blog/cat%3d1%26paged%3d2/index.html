<p>We&#8217;re not going to have a smarter Web until and unless the new tools are easy enough to use. Until then, we&#8217;ll have Web 2.0, as described <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/06/why_the_world_is_ready_for_the.html">here</a>. As Zombini explains, these Web 2.0 technologies already have semantic qualities, but they are held back by &#8220;using older, more limited technologies because of our lack of understanding and desire to learn complex new languages.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Originally posted on 8/1/2006 by John De Oliveira</em></p>
<p>A lot has been happening at the Cyc Foundation, even though nothing has been happening with this blog. Some folks have expressed confusion over where to go for Cyc Foundation information. People who want to get their hands dirty and participate can just email me (johnd at cycfoundation.org). Tell me a little about yourself and why your interested, and we&#8217;ll add you to the mailing list and get you access to the wiki.</p>
<p>Better yet, we now have a server that is operational. So, the logical next step will be to put up a website. We&#8217;re working on it, along with several other projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re making an application that will let people (and some background programs) determine links between Wikipedia article titles and Cyc concept terms. This will grow the Cyc ontology and provide a way to access Wikipedia content semantically.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re getting ready to publish the Cyc ontology as a Semantic Web resource, with one URI per concept.</li>
<li>We&#8217;re creating REST Web services for easy access to create, read, update, delete and query Cyc concepts, facts and rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further descriptions of all of these are available on the members-only Wiki and will also be available on the website.</p>

<p><em>Originally posted on 5/26/2006 by John De Oliveira</em></p>
<p>We had 10 programmers from around the country on a Skypecast (conference call) for 90 minutes last night discussing creating web services for Cyc. We&#8217;ve got some issues to work out with microphones and with getting on the call in the first place. Still, it was a worthwhile call.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be talking again next Wednesday (May 31, 2006) at 8:30pm Central Standard Time. Central time is one hour earlier than the East Coast and two hours later than the West Coast. It&#8217;s a public call, so anyone can join, but we usually mute people to improve sound quality. There&#8217;s chat that happens alongside the audio, and we may use VNC to do screen sharing next time. To join the call, you first have to join Skype (for free). Go to www.skype.com. Then, on the Skype home page, there&#8217;s a link for skypecasts. Then look for &#8220;Find a Skypecast&#8221; &#8220;starting soon&#8221;. Or you can just visit the link: https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/upcoming</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need to get your skype address ahead of time. You just click your way into the call. Once in, we may add you to a group chat, and if you want to participate in Cyclify, you can put your contact info into chat.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>P.S. Please test how your microphone sounds before joining the call. Do this by placing a test call to the skype number: echo123. Most people have their mikes way too close at first, and once you&#8217;re on the call it&#8217;s hard to tell.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had 1.5 handfuls of folks contact us from around the U.S. interested in helping with the Cyc Foundation. We&#8217;re grateful for whatever help we can get. Broader support will probably start showing up once the first game is out there on the Web and once Wikipedia linking is underway. Of course, it would help to have help to get those things moving. So, we&#8217;re dealing with a chicken and the egg kind of a thing. And not even Cyc knows which came first.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve often heard that complaint when I describe that Cyc uses deduction to do reasoning. That&#8217;s not how people think. First of all, I don&#8217;t want to claim that Cyc &#8220;thinks&#8221; at all, but sometimes its expedient to use expressions like that.</p>
<p>As for how people think, who knows? There&#8217;s a lot of research in that area, but we really don&#8217;t know yet how people think. I suspect it&#8217;s quite different than the processing that goes on in the Cyc inference engine. But who cares? It was never a goal to emulate human beings; it was merely a goal to in some sense understand the world of humans.</p>
<p>Consider the airplane. It is the man-made version of a bird, only faster, more powerful and controllable. Where are its feathers? Why don&#8217;t its wings flap?</p>
<p>Many of man&#8217;s tools serve the purpose of amplifying some existing capability. The telephone amplifies the ear and mouth. The bicycle amplifies power of the legs. A technology such as Cyc can amplify the power of the mind even if it doesn&#8217;t work at all like one.</p>

<p><em>Originally posted on 4/20/2006 by John De Oliveira</em></p>
<p>I said I&#8217;d go into more detail about each of the activities in the Cyc Foundation&#8217;s Cyclify initiative. The purpose that cuts across all activities is to grow the Cyc Knowledge Base. Initially, the focus is on what we call breadth or coverage. We want everything one could think of to have a concept term or a way of forming one from functional terms. A concept term is something like #$CreditCard. A term built functionally is something like (#$BorderBetweenFn #$France #$Germany). The &#8216;#$&#8217; is something used internally by Cyc to distinguish Cyc terms from other kinds of symbols. If you&#8217;re not doing programming, you don&#8217;t have to use it. But sometimes it helps as a way of knowing that you&#8217;re talking about #$France the Cyc term as opposed to &#8220;France&#8221; the string or France the country.</p>
<p>Anyway, we want to fill up Cyc with concepts and with useful facts about the concepts. As a result of the way development proceeded with fits and starts based on where funding was coming from, the coverage in Cyc is very broad but spotty. There may be terms for #$Parsley, #$Sage and #$Rosemary, but #$Thyme might be missing. (Sounds like a song.) As for facts, Cyc may know that yelling is louder than talking, but not know that talking is typically louder than whispering.</p>
<p>The games will be one way of helping to fill in the content. The first game presents the player with statements for which she must choose True, False or Skip. Since many of the questions are common sense things that we all know, challenge is introduced in the form of time pressure. The first game will also have other question types; for example, one type allows the player to choose several answers.</p>
<p>The game is fed by statements that you might call prospective facts. There are several ways to come up with these. One is to have Cyc use natural language generation to create partial search strings &#8212; &#8220;The adult elephant can weigh as much as *&#8221; &#8212; and parse what you get back. Another is to use abduction &#8212; find things that might possibly be true and propose that they are true. The statements that feed the game are in what we call &#8220;the pipeline&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are issues in creating the pipeline. We want to create useful prospective facts; and we also want to be able to categorize them, so that you as a player won&#8217;t keep getting shown statements that you know nothing about. That&#8217;s a challenge we need to address presently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll continue with more about the game next time.</p>
<p>P.S. Bonus points for whoever can tell what musical the title of this post came from.</p>

<p>Cyclify, the grass-roots initiative of the Cyc Foundation, is composed of the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Games for growing the knowledge base</li>
<li>Wikipedia knowledge collection</li>
<li>Pairing subject-matter experts (SMEs, pronounced &#8220;smees&#8221;) with ontologists</li>
<li>Alignment with other sources (for example, WordNet)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll make a separate post for each of these, in order to go into more detail. Something that applies to all of them is the fact that they depend on the help of people who are not experts in artificial intelligence. We still need the experts, but they&#8217;ll be working side-by-side with people who are life-smart. Experts in other fields, experts at being human (or at least much better at it than computers), and people who can help with coordinating, supporting and motivating everyone&#8217;s play.</p>
<p>Outside of Cyclify, the Cyc Foundation will be working on issues related to standards, ResearchCyc coordination and other things.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be using the Basecamp program, which was developed with Ruby on Rails. We&#8217;ll be setting up accounts for people who join the Cyc Foundation. You can request membership by sending an email with your background and interests to johndcyc@gmail.com.</p>
