		<description>Comment from Ivan Herman &lt;ivan@ivan-herman.net&gt;, originally posted at Google+ :

Entry level OWL inferencing becoming more and more feasible...

I wonder whether it would be different if OWL 2 RL was used instead of OWL Horst (i.e., to see if OWL 2 RL introduces features that make the possible optimizations difficult or impossible...). This would be important to know, if the community would define some sort of a sub-set of OWL 2 RL for practical purposes. Or is OWL Horst really that subset (there are features in OWL 2 RL that are really cool, like property chains or keys...)

See you guys around in Bonn to discuss this further...</description>

		<description>Thanks for sharing this. However I suppose that the rate of explosion highly depends on the vocabulary that is used in the data. For instance some SKOS properties are rarely made explicit but most FOAF properties are make explicit. So the numbers don't tell that much, it is like comparing apples and oranges.</description>

		<description>Hi there!

Thanks for these very interestings findings! Considering the 16 fold increase of DBPedia, and the general exponential-like distribution of the other factors, it would also be relevant to know how much of these inferred triples are actually useful. These 47k inferred DBPedia triples are most likely not all of equal importance.
If that would be feasible, having a measure telling that an inferred closure ratio of X % is enough to match most of the query needs would ease the compromise between doing no closure and getting too many triples...

Cheers,
Christophe</description>
