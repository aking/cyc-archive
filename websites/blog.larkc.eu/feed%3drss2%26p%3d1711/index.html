		<description>Several research groups in  China universities  expressed their interests to join the LarKC development team in China. They will contribute to the development of plug-ins for the LarKC platform.

Many audiences of the summer school are the beginners in the Semantic Web. They were very enthusiastic about the idea of LarKC. However,  they were not able to point out any weakness in the project.</description>

		<description>Great!

But how did these audiences react?

Did they come up to you with their own ideas on how to use LarKC?

Did they point out any clear weakness or gap in the project?

Where there things that they did not understand or whose value they failed to fully appreciate?
