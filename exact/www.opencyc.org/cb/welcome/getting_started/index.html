Introduction
</h3>
    <p>
Below is a brief description of the administrative steps involved in using OpenCyc, including starting 
and stopping a Cyc process, logging in and out, and saving your work.
</p>

    <h3>

<p></p>
Starting and Stopping the Cyc Server
</h3>
    <p>
The Readme document that accompanies the release includes information about starting 
a Cyc server. The process is slightly different on Windows than on Linux.</p>
<p>At a Windows command-line prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li>cd cyc/run</li>
<li>run-cyc.bat (<i>to launch the Cyc server</i>)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>On Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>cd to cyc/run</li>
<li>./run-cyc.sh (to launch the Cyc server)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>After some time loading the world into memory you will see:</p>

  <table align="center" border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#d3d3d3"><font color="black"><tt><pre>

<p>
<b>CYC(<i>n</i>):</b> is the SubL command prompt.</p>
<p>You can exit Cyc by typing <b>(exit)</b> at the command prompt.</p>
<p></p>

    <h3>
Starting the KB Browser
</h3>
    <p>
To start the KB Browser, just open your Internet browser and enter the URL below replacing <i>HOSTNAME</i> 
with the machine name (or IP number) of the Cyc Server you are running. If you are using a browser 
on the same machine that is running the Cyc server, then you should be able to use "localhost" as 
the host name.
</p>
<p>
http://<i>HOSTNAME</i>:3602/cgi-bin/cyccgi/cg?cb-start
</p>
<p>
After connecting to this link, you should see the login screen.

    <h3>
Logging In
</h3>
    <p>
When you first connect to the Cyc Server using the KB Browser (see the previous step), you are 
already logged in, as Guest. The Guest account has permission to browse through the terms in 
the KB and to use certain tools, such as ASK. In order to use tools that affect a change on the 
knowledge base (such as ASSERT), you need to change identities to something other than 'Guest'. 
If you have not yet created any new identities, log in as CycAdministrator.</p>

<p>
  <img src="http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/img/cb/keyboard_icon.gif" border="0" width="30" alt="Try it yourself! Enter this into your copy of OpenCyc." /> &#160;&#160;
  <font color="#660033">
Type CycAdministrator in the text field within the 'Login Area' and click on the [Submit] button.</font>
</p>
<p>
Once you are logged in as CycAdministrator, you can create a new identity by 
returning to the login screen (click the 'Login' link in the top frame), typing the new 
name into the same text field and clicking [Submit]. You will be asked to confirm that you 
want to create a new Cyclist.</p>

  <table align="center" border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#d3d3d3"><font color="black"><tt><pre>
Unknown Cyclist

The name JohnDoe is not the name of a known HumanCyclist.

Do you want to create a new Cyc constant with this name? You will be 
able to use this constant as you would any other in the Knowledge Base 
as well as login with this new name.
      </pre></tt></font></td>
    </tr>   
  </table>
<p>Click the button that says, 'Yes, Create Cyclist'. The constant #$JohnDoe will now be added to the Knowledge Base.</p>
<p>

  <font color="#660033">
  <em>
Note: You may have noticed that you do not need to use passwords when logging into 
the server from the KB Browser. There is currently no security model implemented 
in OpenCyc. The KB Browser is meant to be accessed by fully trusted users. The 
Cyc API can be used to develop secure interfaces for other users.
  </em></font>

<p>
To change identities (including from or to #$Guest):</p>

<p>

  <font color="#660033">
Enter the name of your Cyc constant in the type-in pane provided (minus the "#$"), then press the 
[Submit] button. For example, the user Fred Smith might be represented in the KB as #$FredSmith. 
To log in, Fred would type "FredSmith" in the input window.
